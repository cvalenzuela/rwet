Squash & sausage risotto

Ingredients
2 small courgettes
1 small aubergine
1 bunch of fresh basil , 15g
1 clove of garlic
olive oil
1 x 400 g tin of tomatoes
75 g mozzarella cheese
50 g dried breadcrumbs
10 g Parmesan cheese
1 lemon
extra virgin olive oil
50 g rocket

Method
Preheat the grill to full whack and place a large tray on a shelf close to the heat.
Trim the courgettes and aubergine, slice lengthways into ½ cm pieces, then place in a bowl. Sprinkle generously with sea salt and toss, then put aside.
Pick the basil leaves, set aside and finely chop the stalks. Peel and finely chop the garlic.
Heat ½ tablespoon of olive oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat, add the garlic and basil stalks, then fry gently for 2 minutes before adding half the tomatoes (save the rest of another day) and the same volume of water. Cook for 10 minutes, or until it reaches a saucy consistency.
Meanwhile, rinse the courgette and aubergine, then pat dry with kitchen roll. Tip back into a bowl and toss with 1 ½ tablespoons of olive oil, and a good pinch of seasoning.
Spread the courgette and aubergine on the hot tray and slide under the heat (you may need to do this in batches, as you want the veg in one layer).
Grill for 5 minutes, or until browned, then flip the veg grill for a further 5 minutes. Keep an eye on the veg as it grills, then tip into a bowl.
Taste and season the sauce, then pour over the vegetables. Tear over the basil leaves and mix.
Spread evenly on the tray and tear over the mozzarella. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs and grate over the Parmesan, then slide back under the grill. Grill until the cheese has melted.
Meanwhile, squeeze half the lemon juice into a bowl, add 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and pinch of seasoning. Mix well, then toss through the rocket. When the parmigiana is bubbling and delicious, divide between plates and serve with the rocket.

MOM B'S FIVE MINUTE FUDGE


 2/3  cup  Evaporated Milk
1-2/3 cup  Sugar
 1/2  tsp  Salt
1-1/2 cup  Marshmallows (Miniatures work best)
1-1/2 cup  Chocolate Chips (Semi-sweet)
  1   tsp  Vanilla

	Combine Milk, Sugar and Salt in saucepan over medium heat.
Bring to a boil and cook 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly (start
timing when the mixture starts to "bubble" around the corners of
the pan).  Remove from heat.  Add Marshmallows, Chocolate Chips and
vanilla.  Stir vigorously for 1 minute (or until Marshmallows are
completely melted and blended).  Pour into a buttered 8" square
pan.  Cool until it doesn't fall out or slosh around in pan.  Eat!

	You like nuts?  Add 1/2 cup chopped nuts before pouring in
pan.  But I like my chocolate rush straight, without the healthy
granola additives.  I refuse to even think about absurdities like
crushed candy cane...


	For the totally inept in the kitchen, or, Kids - Don't Try
This At Home.  Don't leave out ingredients.  So what if you can't
find the vanilla.  If you leave it out the fudge will taste about
the same, but it will be hard enough to use as asphalt patch.
You'll ruin the pan using a chisel to get the fudge out.  Don't
overcook!  Who wants fudge that has strange hard things floating
in it.  Mix well.  You should end up with a uniform texture about
the same appearance as Hersheys Syrup.  It has to cool before it
turns solid.  Buttering the pan means putting just a little butter
or margarine on a clean piece of paper toweling and rubbing the
bottom of the pan with it.  Pretend you're waxing the car.  Same
idea, just grease it up.

KELLEYE'S HOME GINGER BEER
(The whole process takes 16 days, but its great!)

INGREDIENTS TO MAKE THE STARTER:
2 oz. fresh-active yeast (I usually find it in the
refrigerated section near the cream cheese)
2 Tbsps. superfine sugar
2 Tbsps. fresh ground dried ginger
(I grind my own in the Cuisinart)
1 1/4 C. water

INGREDIENTS TO FEED THE STARTER:
10 tsps. superfine sugar
10 tsps. fresh ground dried ginger

INGREDIENTS TO FINISH THE BEER:
19 C. water
Juice of 2 Lg. lemons
2 1/4 C. superfine sugar


To start the process-  Mash the yeast and sugar together
in a bowl until it gets runny (trust me-it gets runny).
Add the 2 Tbsp. ginger and stir in 1/4 c. water-hot to the
touch but not too hot or you'll kill the yeast.  Stir well
and add the remaining cup.  Pour the mixture into a glass jar
and put it in a warm place, uncovered, (I keep it in the
drawer of my waterbed) to allow it to ferment.
Everyday feed this mess with 1 tsp. sugar and 1 tsp.
ginger. Sprinkle it evenly over the top.
At the end of ten (10) days take a pan and heat the
3 3/4 c. water and dissolve the 2 1/4 c. sugar in it.
Take a LARGE clean bucket or pan and pour in the sugar/water.
Add 2 1/2 c. cold water and the lemon juice. Then add the
remaining 12 1/2 c. cold water.  Strain the starter,into the
bucket,thru several layers of cheesecloth to remove the
sludge.  Set aside.  Using a funnel pour the almost beer into
clean 2 liter plastic bottles, leaving a 2" airspace at the
top of each bottle.  Screw on tops lightly BUT DON'T TIGHTEN
THEM DOWN !!!! until the next day.
Let them sit for four (4) days unrefrigerated. Keep an
eye on them as I have a friend who said one exploded.  If
they look like they might burst let a liitle fizz out.
Chill 24 hrs. there will be sediment on the bottom- try
to keep from shaking it in.  Open CAREFULLY as it tends to
spew a bit. I've found the best way to deal with this little
problem (after dousing myself twice...) is too have a lg.
pitcher in the sink, put on an apron (just in case) open the
top as fast as I can and up-end it into the pitcher before it
blows.  Speed is the key. Drink what you want, rinse the
bottle out and pour the beer back in to store it. If it goes
flat you can sometimes set it in a warm spot for a day or so
and it will ferment back up.
To start a second batch take the sludge you set aside,
devide it in half, add 1 1/4 c. warm water and start feeding
for 10 days following the above directions.
I don't know the alcohol content but it tastes great on
a hot day! Enjoy....

stirring often, for another 30 to 45 minutes or until the pork is
tender and the chili is thickened to your liking.  Taste for correct
