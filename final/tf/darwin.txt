'beagle,' as naturalist, i was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of south america, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. these facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers. on my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it. after five years' work i allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these i enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable: from that period to the present day i have steadily pursued the same object. i hope that i may be excused for entering on these personal details, as i give them to show that i have not been hasty in coming to a decision. my work is now nearly finished; but as it will take me two or three more years to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, i have been urged to publish this abstract. i have more especially been induced to do this, as mr. wallace, who is now studying the natural history of the malay archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that i have on the origin of species. last year he sent to me a memoir on this subject, with a request that i would forward it to sir charles lyell, who sent it to the linnean society, and it is published in the third volume of the journal of that society. sir c. lyell and dr. hooker, who both knew of my work--the latter having read my sketch of 1844--honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish, with mr. wallace's excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts. this abstract, which i now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. i cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements; and i must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy. no doubt errors will have crept in, though i hope i have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone. i can here give only the general conclusions at which i have arrived, with a few facts in illustration, but which, i hope, in most cases will suffice. no one can feel more sensible than i do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in detail all the facts, with references, on which my conclusions have been grounded; and i hope in a future work to do this. for i am well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts cannot be adduced, often apparently leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which i have arrived. a fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question; and this cannot possibly be here done. i much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of acknowledging the generous assistance which i have received from very many naturalists, some of them personally unknown to me. i cannot, however, let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep obligations to dr. hooker, who for the last fifteen years has aided me in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment. in considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryological relations, their geographical distribution, geological succession, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that each species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties, from other species. nevertheless, such a conclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified, so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly excites our admiration. naturalists continually refer to external conditions, such as climate, food, etc., as the only possible cause of variation. in one very limited sense, as we shall hereafter see, this may be true; but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions, the structure, for instance, of the woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue, so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees. in the case of the misseltoe, which draws its nourishment from certain trees, which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which has flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects to bring pollen from one flower to the other, it is equally preposterous to account for the structure of this parasite, with its relations to several distinct organic beings, by the effects of external conditions, or of habit, or of the volition of the plant itself. the author of the 'vestiges of creation' would, i presume, say that, after a certain unknown number of generations, some bird had given birth to a woodpecker, and some plant to the misseltoe, and that these had been produced perfect as we now see them; but this assumption seems to me to be no explanation, for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life, untouched and unexplained. it is, therefore, of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into the means of modification and coadaptation. at the commencement of my observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out this obscure problem. nor have i been disappointed; in this and in all other perplexing cases i have invariably found that our knowledge, imperfect though it be, of variation under domestication, afforded the best and safest clue. i may venture to express my conviction of the high value of such studies, although they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists. from these considerations, i shall devote the first chapter of this abstract to variation under domestication. we shall thus see that a large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible, and, what is equally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of man in accumulating by his selection successive slight variations. i will then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature; but i shall, unfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly, as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts. we shall, however, be enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favourable to variation. in the next chapter the struggle for existence amongst all organic beings throughout the world, which inevitably follows from their high geometrical powers of increase, will be treated of. this is the doctrine of malthus, applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms. as many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. from the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form. this fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated at some length in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how natural selection almost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improved forms of life and induces what i have called divergence of character. in the next chapter i shall discuss the complex and little known laws of variation and of correlation of growth. in the four succeeding chapters, the most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will be given: namely, first, the difficulties of transitions, or in understanding how a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed being or elaborately constructed organ; secondly the subject of instinct, or the mental powers of animals, thirdly, hybridism, or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed; and fourthly, the imperfection of the geological record. in the next chapter i shall consider the geological succession of organic beings throughout time; in the eleventh and twelfth, their geographical distribution throughout space; in the thirteenth, their classification or mutual affinities, both when mature and in an embryonic condition. in the last chapter i shall give a brief recapitulation of the whole work, and a few concluding remarks. no one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in regard to the origin of species and varieties, if he makes due allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of all the beings which live around us. who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare? yet these relations are of the highest importance, for they determine the present welfare, and, as i believe, the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world. still less do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its history. although much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, i can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which i am capable, that the view which most naturalists entertain, and which i formerly entertained--namely, that each species has been independently created--is erroneous. i am fully convinced that species are not immutable; but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species, in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species. furthermore, i am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification. 1. variation under domestication. causes of variability. effects of habit. correlation of growth. inheritance. character of domestic varieties. difficulty of distinguishing between varieties and species. origin of domestic varieties from one or more species. domestic pigeons, their differences and origin. principle of selection anciently followed, its effects. methodical and unconscious selection. unknown origin of our domestic productions. circumstances favourable to man's power of selection. when we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other, than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. when we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment, i think we are driven to conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent-species have been exposed under nature. there is, also, i think, some probability in the view propounded by andrew knight, that this variability may be partly connected with excess of food. it seems pretty clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to the new conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation; and that when the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally continues to vary for many generations. no case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation. our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification. it has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability, whatever they may be, generally act; whether during the early or late period of development of the embryo, or at the instant of conception. geoffroy st. hilaire's experiments show that unnatural treatment of the embryo causes monstrosities; and monstrosities cannot be separated by any clear line of distinction from mere variations. but i am strongly inclined to suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been affected prior to the act of conception. several reasons make me believe in this; but the chief one is the remarkable effect which confinement or cultivation has on the functions of the reproductive system; this system appearing to be far more susceptible than any other part of the organisation, to the action of any change in the conditions of life. nothing is more easy than to tame an animal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even in the many cases when the male and female unite. how many animals there are which will not breed, though living long under not very close confinement in their native country! this is generally attributed to vitiated instincts; but how many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! in some few such cases it has been found out that very trifling changes, such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth, will determine whether or not the plant sets a seed. i cannot here enter on the copious details which i have collected on this curious subject; but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement, i may just mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, with the exception of the plantigrades or bear family; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest exceptions, hardly ever lay fertile eggs. many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless, in the same exact condition as in the most sterile hybrids. when, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, yet breeding quite freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature, perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which i could give numerous instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail in acting, we need not be surprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting not quite regularly, and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents or variable. sterility has been said to be the bane of horticulture; but on this view we owe variability to the same cause which produces sterility; and variability is the source of all the choicest productions of the garden. i may add, that as some organisms will breed most freely under the most unnatural conditions (for instance, the rabbit and ferret kept in hutches), showing that their reproductive system has not been thus affected; so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very slightly--perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature. a long list could easily be given of "sporting plants;" by this term gardeners mean a single bud or offset, which suddenly assumes a new and sometimes very different character from that of the rest of the plant. such buds can be propagated by grafting, etc., and sometimes by seed. these "sports" are extremely rare under nature, but far from rare under cultivation; and in this case we see that the treatment of the parent has affected a bud or offset, and not the ovules or pollen. but it is the opinion of most physiologists that there is no essential difference between a bud and an ovule in their earliest stages of formation; so that, in fact, "sports" support my view, that variability may be largely attributed to the ovules or pollen, or to both, having been affected by the treatment of the parent prior to the act of conception. these cases anyhow show that variation is not necessarily connected, as some authors have supposed, with the act of generation. seedlings from the same fruit, and the young of the same litter, sometimes differ considerably from each other, though both the young and the parents, as muller has remarked, have apparently been exposed to exactly the same conditions of life; and this shows how unimportant the direct effects of the conditions of life are in comparison with the laws of reproduction, and of growth, and of inheritance; for had the action of the conditions been direct, if any of the young had varied, all would probably have varied in the same manner. to judge how much, in the case of any variation, we should attribute to the direct action of heat, moisture, light, food, etc., is most difficult: my impression is, that with animals such agencies have produced very little direct effect, though apparently more in the case of plants. under this point of view, mr. buckman's recent experiments on plants seem extremely valuable. when all or nearly all the individuals exposed to certain conditions are affected in the same way, the change at first appears to be directly due to such conditions; but in some cases it can be shown that quite opposite conditions produce similar changes of structure. nevertheless some slight amount of change may, i think, be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of life--as, in some cases, increased size from amount of food, colour from particular kinds of food and from light, and perhaps the thickness of fur from climate. habit also has a decided influence, as in the period of flowering with plants when transported from one climate to another. in animals it has a more marked effect; for instance, i find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more, in proportion to the whole skeleton, than do the same bones in the wild-duck; and i presume that this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less, and walking more, than its wild parent. the great and inherited development of the udders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked, in comparison with the state of these organs in other countries, is another instance of the effect of use. not a single domestic animal can be named which has not in some country drooping ears; and the view suggested by some authors, that the drooping is due to the disuse of the muscles of the ear, from the animals not being much alarmed by danger, seems probable. there are many laws regulating variation, some few of which can be dimly seen, and will be hereafter briefly mentioned. i will here only allude to what may be called correlation of growth. any change in the embryo or larva will almost certainly entail changes in the mature animal. in monstrosities, the correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious; and many instances are given in isidore geoffroy st. hilaire's great work on this subject. breeders believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied by an elongated head. some instances of correlation are quite whimsical; thus cats with blue eyes are invariably deaf; colour and constitutional peculiarities go together, of which many remarkable cases could be given amongst animals and plants. from the facts collected by heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs are differently affected from coloured individuals by certain vegetable poisons. hairless dogs have imperfect teeth; long-haired and coarse-haired animals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many horns; pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes; pigeons with short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks large feet. hence, if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any peculiarity, he will almost certainly unconsciously modify other parts of the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation of growth. the result of the various, quite unknown, or dimly seen laws of variation is infinitely complex and diversified. it is well worth while carefully to study the several treatises published on some of our old cultivated plants, as on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, etc.; and it is really surprising to note the endless points in structure and constitution in which the varieties and sub-varieties differ slightly from each other. the whole organisation seems to have become plastic, and tends to depart in some small degree from that of the parental type. any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us. but the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance, is endless. dr. prosper lucas's treatise, in two large volumes, is the fullest and the best on this subject. no breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance: like produces like is his fundamental belief: doubts have been thrown on this principle by theoretical writers alone. when a deviation appears not unfrequently, and we see it in the father and child, we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same original cause acting on both; but when amongst individuals, apparently exposed to the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the parent--say, once amongst several million individuals--and it reappears in the child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance. every one must have heard of cases of albinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, etc., appearing in several members of the same family. if strange and rare deviations of structure are truly inherited, less strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable. perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject, would be, to look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly. the laws governing inheritance are quite unknown; no one can say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same species, and in individuals of different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so; why the child often reverts in certain characters to its grandfather or grandmother or other much more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes or to one sex alone, more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex. it is a fact of some little importance to us, that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted either exclusively, or in a much greater degree, to males alone. a much more important rule, which i think may be trusted, is that, at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears, it tends to appear in the offspring at a corresponding age, though sometimes earlier. in many cases this could not be otherwise: thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature; peculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage. but hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension, and that when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age, yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent. i believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology. these remarks are of course confined to the first appearance of the peculiarity, and not to its primary cause, which may have acted on the ovules or male element; in nearly the same manner as in the crossed offspring from a short-horned cow by a long-horned bull, the greater length of horn, though appearing late in life, is clearly due to the male element. having alluded to the subject of reversion, i may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists--namely, that our domestic varieties, when run wild, gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal stocks. hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature. i have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made. there would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly-marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state. in many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was, and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued. it would be quite necessary, in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing, that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home. nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me not improbable, that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance, of the cabbage, in very poor soil (in which case, however, some effect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil), that they would to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild aboriginal stock. whether or not the experiment would succeed, is not of great importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed. if it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion,--that is, to lose their acquired characters, whilst kept under unchanged conditions, and whilst kept in a considerable body, so that free intercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight deviations of structure, in such case, i grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species. but there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed our cart and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of various breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an almost infinite number of generations, would be opposed to all experience. i may add, that when under nature the conditions of life do change, variations and reversions of character probably do occur; but natural selection, as will hereafter be explained, will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved. when we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants, and compare them with species closely allied together, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of character than in true species. domestic races of the same species, also, often have a somewhat monstrous character; by which i mean, that, although differing from each other, and from the other species of the same genus, in several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part, both when compared one with another, and more especially when compared with all the species in nature to which they are nearest allied. with these exceptions (and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crossed,--a subject hereafter to be discussed), domestic races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as, only in most cases in a lesser degree than, do closely-allied species of the same genus in a state of nature. i think this must be admitted, when we find that there are hardly any domestic races, either amongst animals or plants, which have not been ranked by some competent judges as mere varieties, and by other competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct species. if any marked distinction existed between domestic races and species, this source of doubt could not so perpetually recur. it has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value. i think it could be shown that this statement is hardly correct; but naturalists differ most widely in determining what characters are of generic value; all such valuations being at present empirical. moreover, on the view of the origin of genera which i shall presently give, we have no right to expect often to meet with generic differences in our domesticated productions. when we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between the domestic races of the same species, we are soon involved in doubt, from not knowing whether they have descended from one or several parent-species. this point, if it could be cleared up, would be interesting; if, for instance, it could be shown that the greyhound, bloodhound, terrier, spaniel, and bull-dog, which we all know propagate their kind so truly, were the offspring of any single species, then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many very closely allied and natural species--for instance, of the many foxes--inhabiting different quarters of the world. i do not believe, as we shall presently see, that all our dogs have descended from any one wild species; but, in the case of some other domestic races, there is presumptive, or even strong, evidence in favour of this view. it has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and likewise to withstand diverse climates. i do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions; but how could a savage possibly know, when he first tamed an animal, whether it would vary in succeeding generations, and whether it would endure other climates? has the little variability of the ass or guinea-fowl, or the small power of endurance of warmth by the rein-deer, or of cold by the common camel, prevented their domestication? i cannot doubt that if other animals and plants, equal in number to our domesticated productions, and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries, were taken from a state of nature, and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication, they would vary on an average as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied. in the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants, i do not think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion, whether they have descended from one or several species. the argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is, that we find in the most ancient records, more especially on the monuments of egypt, much diversity in the breeds; and that some of the breeds closely resemble, perhaps are identical with, those still existing. even if this latter fact were found more strictly and generally true than seems to me to be the case, what does it show, but that some of our breeds originated there, four or five thousand years ago? but mr. horner's researches have rendered it in some degree probable that man sufficiently civilized to have manufactured pottery existed in the valley of the nile thirteen or fourteen thousand years ago; and who will pretend to say how long before these ancient periods, savages, like those of tierra del fuego or australia, who possess a semi-domestic dog, may not have existed in egypt? the whole subject must, i think, remain vague; nevertheless, i may, without here entering on any details, state that, from geographical and other considerations, i think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have descended from several wild species. in regard to sheep and goats i can form no opinion. i should think, from facts communicated to me by mr. blyth, on the habits, voice, and constitution, etc., of the humped indian cattle, that these had descended from a different aboriginal stock from our european cattle; and several competent judges believe that these latter have had more than one wild parent. with respect to horses, from reasons which i cannot give here, i am doubtfully inclined to believe, in opposition to several authors, that all the races have descended from one wild stock. mr. blyth, whose opinion, from his large and varied stores of knowledge, i should value more than that of almost any one, thinks that all the breeds of poultry have proceeded from the common wild indian fowl (gallus bankiva). in regard to ducks and rabbits, the breeds of which differ considerably from each other in structure, i do not doubt that they all have descended from the common wild duck and rabbit. the doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors. they believe that every race which breeds true, let the distinctive characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype. at this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle, as many sheep, and several goats in europe alone, and several even within great britain. one author believes that there formerly existed in great britain eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it! when we bear in mind that britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal, and france but few distinct from those of germany and conversely, and so with hungary, spain, etc., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle, sheep, etc., we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in europe; for whence could they have been derived, as these several countries do not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parent-stocks? so it is in india. even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world, which i fully admit have probably descended from several wild species, i cannot doubt that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation. who can believe that animals closely resembling the italian greyhound, the bloodhound, the bull-dog, or blenheim spaniel, etc.--so unlike all wild canidae--ever existed freely in a state of nature? it has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species; but by crossing we can get only forms in some degree intermediate between their parents; and if we account for our several domestic races by this process, we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms, as the italian greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, etc., in the wild state. moreover, the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated. there can be no doubt that a race may be modified by occasional crosses, if aided by the careful selection of those individual mongrels, which present any desired character; but that a race could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely different races or species, i can hardly believe. sir j. sebright expressly experimentised for this object, and failed. the offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as i have found with pigeons) extremely uniform, and everything seems simple enough; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations, hardly two of them will be alike, and then the extreme difficulty, or rather utter hopelessness, of the task becomes apparent. certainly, a breed intermediate between two very distinct breeds could not be got without extreme care and long-continued selection; nor can i find a single case on record of a permanent race having been thus formed. on the breeds of the domestic pigeon. believing that it is always best to study some special group, i have, after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons. i have kept every breed which i could purchase or obtain, and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world, more especially by the honourable w. elliot from india, and by the honourable c. murray from persia. many treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons, and some of them are very important, as being of considerable antiquity. i have associated with several eminent fanciers, and have been permitted to join two of the london pigeon clubs. the diversity of the breeds is something astonishing. compare the english carrier and the short-faced tumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks, entailing corresponding differences in their skulls. the carrier, more especially the male bird, is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head, and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids, very large external orifices to the nostrils, and a wide gape of mouth. the short-faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch; and the common tumbler has the singular and strictly inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock, and tumbling in the air head over heels. the runt is a bird of great size, with long, massive beak and large feet; some of the sub-breeds of runts have very long necks, others very long wings and tails, others singularly short tails. the barb is allied to the carrier, but, instead of a very long beak, has a very short and very broad one. the pouter has a much elongated body, wings, and legs; and its enormously developed crop, which it glories in inflating, may well excite astonishment and even laughter. the turbit has a very short and conical beak, with a line of reversed feathers down the breast; and it has the habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the oesophagus. the jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood, and it has, proportionally to its size, much elongated wing and tail feathers. the trumpeter and laugher, as their names express, utter a very different coo from the other breeds. the fantail has thirty or even forty tail-feathers, instead of twelve or fourteen, the normal number in all members of the great pigeon family; and these feathers are kept expanded, and are carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail touch; the oil-gland is quite aborted. several other less distinct breeds might have been specified. in the skeletons of the several breeds, the development of the bones of the face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously. the shape, as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw, varies in a highly remarkable manner. the number of the caudal and sacral vertebrae vary; as does the number of the ribs, together with their relative breadth and the presence of processes. the size and shape of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable; so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula. the proportional width of the gape of mouth, the proportional length of the eyelids, of the orifice of the nostrils, of the tongue (not always in strict correlation with the length of beak), the size of the crop and of the upper part of the oesophagus; the development and abortion of the oil-gland; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers; the relative length of wing and tail to each other and to the body; the relative length of leg and of the feet; the number of scutellae on the toes, the development of skin between the toes, are all points of structure which are variable. the period at which the perfect plumage is acquired varies, as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds are clothed when hatched. the shape and size of the eggs vary. the manner of flight differs remarkably; as does in some breeds the voice and disposition. lastly, in certain breeds, the males and females have come to differ to a slight degree from each other. altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which if shown to an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly, i think, be ranked by him as well-defined species. moreover, i do not believe that any ornithologist would place the english carrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and fantail in the same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly-inherited sub-breeds, or species as he might have called them, could be shown him. great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons, i am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely, that all have descended from the rock-pigeon (columba livia), including under this term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ from each other in the most trifling respects. as several of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases, i will here briefly give them. if the several breeds are not varieties, and have not proceeded from the rock-pigeon, they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks; for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number: how, for instance, could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent-stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop? the supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been rock-pigeons, that is, not breeding or willingly perching on trees. but besides c. livia, with its geographical sub-species, only two or three other species of rock-pigeons are known; and these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds. hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated, and yet be unknown to ornithologists; and this, considering their size, habits, and remarkable characters, seems very improbable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state. but birds breeding on precipices, and good fliers, are unlikely to be exterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits with the domestic breeds, has not been exterminated even on several of the smaller british islets, or on the shores of the mediterranean. hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock-pigeon seems to me a very rash assumption. moreover, the several above-named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world, and, therefore, some of them must have been carried back again into their native country; but not one has ever become wild or feral, though the dovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very slightly altered state, has become feral in several places. again, all recent experience shows that it is most difficult to get any wild animal to breed freely under domestication; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons, it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quite prolific under confinement. an argument, as it seems to me, of great weight, and applicable in several other cases, is, that the above-specified breeds, though agreeing generally in constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and in most parts of their structure, with the wild rock-pigeon, yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts of their structure: we may look in vain throughout the whole great family of columbidae for a beak like that of the english carrier, or that of the short-faced tumbler, or barb; for reversed feathers like those of the jacobin; for a crop like that of the pouter; for tail-feathers like those of the fantail. hence it must be assumed not only that half-civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and further, that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown. so many strange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree. some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration. the rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue, and has a white rump (the indian sub-species, c. intermedia of strickland, having it bluish); the tail has a terminal dark bar, with the bases of the outer feathers externally edged with white; the wings have two black bars; some semi-domestic breeds and some apparently truly wild breeds have, besides the two black bars, the wings chequered with black. these several marks do not occur together in any other species of the whole family. now, in every one of the domestic breeds, taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all the above marks, even to the white edging of the outer tail-feathers, sometimes concur perfectly developed. moreover, when two birds belonging to two distinct breeds are crossed, neither of which is blue or has any of the above-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these characters; for instance, i crossed some uniformly white fantails with some uniformly black barbs, and they produced mottled brown and black birds; these i again crossed together, and one grandchild of the pure white fantail and pure black barb was of as beautiful a blue colour, with the white rump, double black wing-bar, and barred and white-edged tail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon! we can understand these facts, on the well-known principle of reversion to ancestral characters, if all the domestic breeds have descended from the rock-pigeon. but if we deny this, we must make one of the two following highly improbable suppositions. either, firstly, that all the several imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the rock-pigeon, although no other existing species is thus coloured and marked, so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to revert to the very same colours and markings. or, secondly, that each breed, even the purest, has within a dozen or, at most, within a score of generations, been crossed by the rock-pigeon: i say within a dozen or twenty generations, for we know of no fact countenancing the belief that the child ever reverts to some one ancestor, removed by a greater number of generations. in a breed which has been crossed only once with some distinct breed, the tendency to reversion to any character derived from such cross will naturally become less and less, as in each succeeding generation there will be less of the foreign blood; but when there has been no cross with a distinct breed, and there is a tendency in both parents to revert to a character, which has been lost during some former generation, this tendency, for all that we can see to the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations. these two distinct cases are often confounded in treatises on inheritance. lastly, the hybrids or mongrels from between all the domestic breeds of pigeons are perfectly fertile. i can state this from my own observations, purposely made on the most distinct breeds. now, it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to bring forward one case of the hybrid offspring of two animals clearly distinct being themselves perfectly fertile. some authors believe that long-continued domestication eliminates this strong tendency to sterility: from the history of the dog i think there is some probability in this hypothesis, if applied to species closely related together, though it is unsupported by a single experiment. but to extend the hypothesis so far as to suppose that species, aboriginally as distinct as carriers, tumblers, pouters, and fantails now are, should yield offspring perfectly fertile, inter se, seems to me rash in the extreme. from these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having formerly got seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freely under domestication; these supposed species being quite unknown in a wild state, and their becoming nowhere feral; these species having very abnormal characters in certain respects, as compared with all other columbidae, though so like in most other respects to the rock-pigeon; the blue colour and various marks occasionally appearing in all the breeds, both when kept pure and when crossed; the mongrel offspring being perfectly fertile;--from these several reasons, taken together, i can feel no doubt that all our domestic breeds have descended from the columba livia with its geographical sub-species. in favour of this view, i may add, firstly, that c. livia, or the rock-pigeon, has been found capable of domestication in europe and in india; and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure with all the domestic breeds. secondly, although an english carrier or short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the rock-pigeon, yet by comparing the several sub-breeds of these breeds, more especially those brought from distant countries, we can make an almost perfect series between the extremes of structure. thirdly, those characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed, for instance the wattle and length of beak of the carrier, the shortness of that of the tumbler, and the number of tail-feathers in the fantail, are in each breed eminently variable; and the explanation of this fact will be obvious when we come to treat of selection. fourthly, pigeons have been watched, and tended with the utmost care, and loved by many people. they have been domesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the world; the earliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth aegyptian dynasty, about 3000 b.c., as was pointed out to me by professor lepsius; but mr. birch informs me that pigeons are given in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty. in the time of the romans, as we hear from pliny, immense prices were given for pigeons; "nay, they are come to this pass, that they can reckon up their pedigree and race." pigeons were much valued by akber khan in india, about the year 1600; never less than 20,000 pigeons were taken with the court. "the monarchs of iran and turan sent him some very rare birds;" and, continues the courtly historian, "his majesty by crossing the breeds, which method was never practised before, has improved them astonishingly." about this same period the dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old romans. the paramount importance of these considerations in explaining the immense amount of variation which pigeons have undergone, will be obvious when we treat of selection. we shall then, also, see how it is that the breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous character. it is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct breeds, that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life; and thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary. i have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some, yet quite insufficient, length; because when i first kept pigeons and watched the several kinds, knowing well how true they bred, i felt fully as much difficulty in believing that they could ever have descended from a common parent, as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard to the many species of finches, or other large groups of birds, in nature. one circumstance has struck me much; namely, that all the breeders of the various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants, with whom i have ever conversed, or whose treatises i have read, are firmly convinced that the several breeds to which each has attended, are descended from so many aboriginally distinct species. ask, as i have asked, a celebrated raiser of hereford cattle, whether his cattle might not have descended from long horns, and he will laugh you to scorn. i have never met a pigeon, or poultry, or duck, or rabbit fancier, who was not fully convinced that each main breed was descended from a distinct species. van mons, in his treatise on pears and apples, shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several sorts, for instance a ribston-pippin or codlin-apple, could ever have proceeded from the seeds of the same tree. innumerable other examples could be given. the explanation, i think, is simple: from long-continued study they are strongly impressed with the differences between the several races; and though they well know that each race varies slightly, for they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences, yet they ignore all general arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences accumulated during many successive generations. may not those naturalists who, knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than does the breeder, and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate links in the long lines of descent, yet admit that many of our domestic races have descended from the same parents--may they not learn a lesson of caution, when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other species? selection. let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been produced, either from one or from several allied species. some little effect may, perhaps, be attributed to the direct action of the external conditions of life, and some little to habit; but he would be a bold man who would account by such agencies for the differences of a dray and race horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon. one of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we see in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal's or plant's own good, but to man's use or fancy. some variations useful to him have probably arisen suddenly, or by one step; many botanists, for instance, believe that the fuller's teazle, with its hooks, which cannot be rivalled by any mechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild dipsacus; and this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling. so it has probably been with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have been the case with the ancon sheep. but when we compare the dray-horse and race-horse, the dromedary and camel, the various breeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated land or mountain pasture, with the wool of one breed good for one purpose, and that of another breed for another purpose; when we compare the many breeds of dogs, each good for man in very different ways; when we compare the game-cock, so pertinacious in battle, with other breeds so little quarrelsome, with "everlasting layers" which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so small and elegant; when we compare the host of agricultural, culinary, orchard, and flower-garden races of plants, most useful to man at different seasons and for different purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we must, i think, look further than to mere variability. we cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in several cases, we know that this has not been their history. the key is man's power of accumulative selection: nature gives successive variations; man adds them up in certain directions useful to him. in this sense he may be said to make for himself useful breeds. the great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical. it is certain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a single lifetime, modified to a large extent some breeds of cattle and sheep. in order fully to realise what they have done, it is almost necessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject, and to inspect the animals. breeders habitually speak of an animal's organisation as something quite plastic, which they can model almost as they please. if i had space i could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly competent authorities. youatt, who was probably better acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any other individual, and who was himself a very good judge of an animal, speaks of the principle of selection as "that which enables the agriculturist, not only to modify the character of his flock, but to change it altogether. it is the magician's wand, by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases." lord somerville, speaking of what breeders have done for sheep, says:--"it would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself, and then had given it existence." that most skilful breeder, sir john sebright, used to say, with respect to pigeons, that "he would produce any given feather in three years, but it would take him six years to obtain head and beak." in saxony the importance of the principle of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised, that men follow it as a trade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture by a connoisseur; this is done three times at intervals of months, and the sheep are each time marked and classed, so that the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding. what english breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous prices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have now been exported to almost every quarter of the world. the improvement is by no means generally due to crossing different breeds; all the best breeders are strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes amongst closely allied sub-breeds. and when a cross has been made, the closest selection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases. if selection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety, and breeding from it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth notice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the accumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye--differences which i for one have vainly attempted to appreciate. not one man in a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder. if gifted with these qualities, and he studies his subject for years, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance, he will succeed, and may make great improvements; if he wants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail. few would readily believe in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to become even a skilful pigeon-fancier. the same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations are here often more abrupt. no one supposes that our choicest productions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal stock. we have proofs that this is not so in some cases, in which exact records have been kept; thus, to give a very trifling instance, the steadily-increasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted. we see an astonishing improvement in many florists' flowers, when the flowers of the present day are compared with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago. when a race of plants is once pretty well established, the seed-raisers do not pick out the best plants, but merely go over their seed-beds, and pull up the "rogues," as they call the plants that deviate from the proper standard. with animals this kind of selection is, in fact, also followed; for hardly any one is so careless as to allow his worst animals to breed. in regard to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated effects of selection--namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in the different varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the diversity of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the kitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties; and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties. see how different the leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the flowers; how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the leaves; how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size, colour, shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present very slight differences. it is not that the varieties which differ largely in some one point do not differ at all in other points; this is hardly ever, perhaps never, the case. the laws of correlation of growth, the importance of which should never be overlooked, will ensure some differences; but, as a general rule, i cannot doubt that the continued selection of slight variations, either in the leaves, the flowers, or the fruit, will produce races differing from each other chiefly in these characters. it may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to methodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century; it has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises have been published on the subject; and the result, i may add, has been, in a corresponding degree, rapid and important. but it is very far from true that the principle is a modern discovery. i could give several references to the full acknowledgment of the importance of the principle in works of high antiquity. in rude and barbarous periods of english history choice animals were often imported, and laws were passed to prevent their exportation: the destruction of horses under a certain size was ordered, and this may be compared to the "roguing" of plants by nurserymen. the principle of selection i find distinctly given in an ancient chinese encyclopaedia. explicit rules are laid down by some of the roman classical writers. from passages in genesis, it is clear that the colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to. savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to improve the breed, and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages in pliny. the savages in south africa match their draught cattle by colour, as do some of the esquimaux their teams of dogs. livingstone shows how much good domestic breeds are valued by the negroes of the interior of africa who have not associated with europeans. some of these facts do not show actual selection, but they show that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times, and is now attended to by the lowest savages. it would, indeed, have been a strange fact, had attention not been paid to breeding, for the inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious. at the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with a distinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior to anything existing in the country. but, for our purpose, a kind of selection, which may be called unconscious, and which results from every one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is more important. thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs, but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed. nevertheless i cannot doubt that this process, continued during centuries, would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as bakewell, collins, etc., by this very same process, only carried on more methodically, did greatly modify, even during their own lifetimes, the forms and qualities of their cattle. slow and insensible changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question had been made long ago, which might serve for comparison. in some cases, however, unchanged or but little changed individuals of the same breed may be found in less civilised districts, where the breed has been less improved. there is reason to believe that king charles's spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent since the time of that monarch. some highly competent authorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel, and has probably been slowly altered from it. it is known that the english pointer has been greatly changed within the last century, and in this case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly effected by crosses with the fox-hound; but what concerns us is, that the change has been effected unconsciously and gradually, and yet so effectually, that, though the old spanish pointer certainly came from spain, mr. borrow has not seen, as i am informed by him, any native dog in spain like our pointer. by a similar process of selection, and by careful training, the whole body of english racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent arab stock, so that the latter, by the regulations for the goodwood races, are favoured in the weights they carry. lord spencer and others have shown how the cattle of england have increased in weight and in early maturity, compared with the stock formerly kept in this country. by comparing the accounts given in old pigeon treatises of carriers and tumblers with these breeds as now existing in britain, india, and persia, we can, i think, clearly trace the stages through which they have insensibly passed, and come to differ so greatly from the rock-pigeon. youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of selection, which may be considered as unconsciously followed, in so far that the breeders could never have expected or even have wished to have produced the result which ensued--namely, the production of two distinct strains. the two flocks of leicester sheep kept by mr. buckley and mr. burgess, as mr. youatt remarks, "have been purely bred from the original stock of mr. bakewell for upwards of fifty years. there is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of mr. bakewell's flock, and yet the difference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties." if there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited character of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal particularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully preserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are so liable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection going on. we see the value set on animals even by the barbarians of tierra del fuego, by their killing and devouring their old women, in times of dearth, as of less value than their dogs. in plants the same gradual process of improvement, through the occasional preservation of the best individuals, whether or not sufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties, and whether or not two or more species or races have become blended together by crossing, may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease, rose, pelargonium, dahlia, and other plants, when compared with the older varieties or with their parent-stocks. no one would ever expect to get a first-rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant. no one would expect to raise a first-rate melting pear from the seed of a wild pear, though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild, if it had come from a garden-stock. the pear, though cultivated in classical times, appears, from pliny's description, to have been a fruit of very inferior quality. i have seen great surprise expressed in horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners, in having produced such splendid results from such poor materials; but the art, i cannot doubt, has been simple, and, as far as the final result is concerned, has been followed almost unconsciously. it has consisted in always cultivating the best known variety, sowing its seeds, and, when a slightly better variety has chanced to appear, selecting it, and so onwards. but the gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated the best pear they could procure, never thought what splendid fruit we should eat; though we owe our excellent fruit, in some small degree, to their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find. a large amount of change in our cultivated plants, thus slowly and unconsciously accumulated, explains, as i believe, the well-known fact, that in a vast number of cases we cannot recognise, and therefore do not know, the wild parent-stocks of the plants which have been longest cultivated in our flower and kitchen gardens. if it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither australia, the cape of good hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. it is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised. in regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should not be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food, at least during certain seasons. and in two countries very differently circumstanced, individuals of the same species, having slightly different constitutions or structure, would often succeed better in the one country than in the other, and thus by a process of "natural selection," as will hereafter be more fully explained, two sub-breeds might be formed. this, perhaps, partly explains what has been remarked by some authors, namely, that the varieties kept by savages have more of the character of species than the varieties kept in civilised countries. on the view here given of the all-important part which selection by man has played, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic races show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man's wants or fancies. we can, i think, further understand the frequently abnormal character of our domestic races, and likewise their differences being so great in external characters and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs. man can hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible; and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal. he can never act by selection, excepting on variations which are first given to him in some slight degree by nature. no man would ever try to make a fantail, till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size; and the more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first appeared, the more likely it would be to catch his attention. but to use such an expression as trying to make a fantail, is, i have no doubt, in most cases, utterly incorrect. the man who first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail, never dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon would become through long-continued, partly unconscious and partly methodical selection. perhaps the parent bird of all fantails had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded, like the present java fantail, or like individuals of other and distinct breeds, in which as many as seventeen tail-feathers have been counted. perhaps the first pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagus,--a habit which is disregarded by all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the breed. nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be necessary to catch the fancier's eye: he perceives extremely small differences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however slight, in one's own possession. nor must the value which would formerly be set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species, be judged of by the value which would now be set on them, after several breeds have once fairly been established. many slight differences might, and indeed do now, arise amongst pigeons, which are rejected as faults or deviations from the standard of perfection of each breed. the common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties; hence the thoulouse and the common breed, which differ only in colour, that most fleeting of characters, have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry-shows. i think these views further explain what has sometimes been noticed--namely that we know nothing about the origin or history of any of our domestic breeds. but, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language, can hardly be said to have had a definite origin. a man preserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure, or takes more care than usual in matching his best animals and thus improves them, and the improved individuals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood. but as yet they will hardly have a distinct name, and from being only slightly valued, their history will be disregarded. when further improved by the same slow and gradual process, they will spread more widely, and will get recognised as something distinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a provincial name. in semi-civilised countries, with little free communication, the spreading and knowledge of any new sub-breed will be a slow process. as soon as the points of value of the new sub-breed are once fully acknowledged, the principle, as i have called it, of unconscious selection will always tend,--perhaps more at one period than at another, as the breed rises or falls in fashion,--perhaps more in one district than in another, according to the state of civilisation of the inhabitants--slowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed, whatever they may be. but the chance will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow, varying, and insensible changes. i must now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable, or the reverse, to man's power of selection. a high degree of variability is obviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to work on; not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient, with extreme care, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of modification in almost any desired direction. but as variations manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being kept; and hence this comes to be of the highest importance to success. on this principle marshall has remarked, with respect to the sheep of parts of yorkshire, that "as they generally belong to poor people, and are mostly in small lots, they never can be improved." on the other hand, nurserymen, from raising large stocks of the same plants, are generally far more successful than amateurs in getting new and valuable varieties. the keeping of a large number of individuals of a species in any country requires that the species should be placed under favourable conditions of life, so as to breed freely in that country. when the individuals of any species are scanty, all the individuals, whatever their quality may be, will generally be allowed to breed, and this will effectually prevent selection. but probably the most important point of all, is, that the animal or plant should be so highly useful to man, or so much valued by him, that the closest attention should be paid to even the slightest deviation in the qualities or structure of each individual. unless such attention be paid nothing can be effected. i have seen it gravely remarked, that it was most fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when gardeners began to attend closely to this plant. no doubt the strawberry had always varied since it was cultivated, but the slight varieties had been neglected. as soon, however, as gardeners picked out individual plants with slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, and raised seedlings from them, and again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them, then, there appeared (aided by some crossing with distinct species) those many admirable varieties of the strawberry which have been raised during the last thirty or forty years. in the case of animals with separate sexes, facility in preventing crosses is an important element of success in the formation of new races,--at least, in a country which is already stocked with other races. in this respect enclosure of the land plays a part. wandering savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same species. pigeons can be mated for life, and this is a great convenience to the fancier, for thus many races may be kept true, though mingled in the same aviary; and this circumstance must have largely favoured the improvement and formation of new breeds. pigeons, i may add, can be propagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate, and inferior birds may be freely rejected, as when killed they serve for food. on the other hand, cats, from their nocturnal rambling habits, cannot be matched, and, although so much valued by women and children, we hardly ever see a distinct breed kept up; such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country, often from islands. although i do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat, the donkey, peacock, goose, etc., may be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into play: in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by poor people, and little attention paid to their breeding; in peacocks, from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese, from being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct breeds. to sum up on the origin of our domestic races of animals and plants. i believe that the conditions of life, from their action on the reproductive system, are so far of the highest importance as causing variability. i do not believe that variability is an inherent and necessary contingency, under all circumstances, with all organic beings, as some authors have thought. the effects of variability are modified by various degrees of inheritance and of reversion. variability is governed by many unknown laws, more especially by that of correlation of growth. something may be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of life. something must be attributed to use and disuse. the final result is thus rendered infinitely complex. in some cases, i do not doubt that the intercrossing of species, aboriginally distinct, has played an important part in the origin of our domestic productions. when in any country several domestic breeds have once been established, their occasional intercrossing, with the aid of selection, has, no doubt, largely aided in the formation of new sub-breeds; but the importance of the crossing of varieties has, i believe, been greatly exaggerated, both in regard to animals and to those plants which are propagated by seed. in plants which are temporarily propagated by cuttings, buds, etc., the importance of the crossing both of distinct species and of varieties is immense; for the cultivator here quite disregards the extreme variability both of hybrids and mongrels, and the frequent sterility of hybrids; but the cases of plants not propagated by seed are of little importance to us, for their endurance is only temporary. over all these causes of change i am convinced that the accumulative action of selection, whether applied methodically and more quickly, or unconsciously and more slowly, but more efficiently, is by far the predominant power. 2. variation under nature. variability. individual differences. doubtful species. wide ranging, much diffused, and common species vary most. species of the larger genera in any country vary more than the species of the smaller genera. many of the species of the larger genera resemble varieties in being very closely, but unequally, related to each other, and in having restricted ranges. before applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organic beings in a state of nature, we must briefly discuss whether these latter are subject to any variation. to treat this subject at all properly, a long catalogue of dry facts should be given; but these i shall reserve for my future work. nor shall i here discuss the various definitions which have been given of the term species. no one definition has as yet satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species. generally the term includes the unknown element of a distinct act of creation. the term "variety" is almost equally difficult to define; but here community of descent is almost universally implied, though it can rarely be proved. we have also what are called monstrosities; but they graduate into varieties. by a monstrosity i presume is meant some considerable deviation of structure in one part, either injurious to or not useful to the species, and not generally propagated. some authors use the term "variation" in a technical sense, as implying a modification directly due to the physical conditions of life; and "variations" in this sense are supposed not to be inherited: but who can say that the dwarfed condition of shells in the brackish waters of the baltic, or dwarfed plants on alpine summits, or the thicker fur of an animal from far northwards, would not in some cases be inherited for at least some few generations? and in this case i presume that the form would be called a variety. again, we have many slight differences which may be called individual differences, such as are known frequently to appear in the offspring from the same parents, or which may be presumed to have thus arisen, from being frequently observed in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same confined locality. no one supposes that all the individuals of the same species are cast in the very same mould. these individual differences are highly important for us, as they afford materials for natural selection to accumulate, in the same manner as man can accumulate in any given direction individual differences in his domesticated productions. these individual differences generally affect what naturalists consider unimportant parts; but i could show by a long catalogue of facts, that parts which must be called important, whether viewed under a physiological or classificatory point of view, sometimes vary in the individuals of the same species. i am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the cases of variability, even in important parts of structure, which he could collect on good authority, as i have collected, during a course of years. it should be remembered that systematists are far from pleased at finding variability in important characters, and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs, and compare them in many specimens of the same species. i should never have expected that the branching of the main nerves close to the great central ganglion of an insect would have been variable in the same species; i should have expected that changes of this nature could have been effected only by slow degrees: yet quite recently mr. lubbock has shown a degree of variability in these main nerves in coccus, which may almost be compared to the irregular branching of the stem of a tree. this philosophical naturalist, i may add, has also quite recently shown that the muscles in the larvae of certain insects are very far from uniform. authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that important organs never vary; for these same authors practically rank that character as important (as some few naturalists have honestly confessed) which does not vary; and, under this point of view, no instance of an important part varying will ever be found: but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can be given. there is one point connected with individual differences, which seems to me extremely perplexing: i refer to those genera which have sometimes been called "protean" or "polymorphic," in which the species present an inordinate amount of variation; and hardly two naturalists can agree which forms to rank as species and which as varieties. we may instance rubus, rosa, and hieracium amongst plants, several genera of insects, and several genera of brachiopod shells. in most polymorphic genera some of the species have fixed and definite characters. genera which are polymorphic in one country seem to be, with some few exceptions, polymorphic in other countries, and likewise, judging from brachiopod shells, at former periods of time. these facts seem to be very perplexing, for they seem to show that this kind of variability is independent of the conditions of life. i am inclined to suspect that we see in these polymorphic genera variations in points of structure which are of no service or disservice to the species, and which consequently have not been seized on and rendered definite by natural selection, as hereafter will be explained. those forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of species, but which are so closely similar to some other forms, or are so closely linked to them by intermediate gradations, that naturalists do not like to rank them as distinct species, are in several respects the most important for us. we have every reason to believe that many of these doubtful and closely-allied forms have permanently retained their characters in their own country for a long time; for as long, as far as we know, as have good and true species. practically, when a naturalist can unite two forms together by others having intermediate characters, he treats the one as a variety of the other, ranking the most common, but sometimes the one first described, as the species, and the other as the variety. but cases of great difficulty, which i will not here enumerate, sometimes occur in deciding whether or not to rank one form as a variety of another, even when they are closely connected by intermediate links; nor will the commonly-assumed hybrid nature of the intermediate links always remove the difficulty. in very many cases, however, one form is ranked as a variety of another, not because the intermediate links have actually been found, but because analogy leads the observer to suppose either that they do now somewhere exist, or may formerly have existed; and here a wide door for the entry of doubt and conjecture is opened. hence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or a variety, the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide experience seems the only guide to follow. we must, however, in many cases, decide by a majority of naturalists, for few well-marked and well-known varieties can be named which have not been ranked as species by at least some competent judges. that varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot be disputed. compare the several floras of great britain, of france or of the united states, drawn up by different botanists, and see what a surprising number of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good species, and by another as mere varieties. mr. h. c. watson, to whom i lie under deep obligation for assistance of all kinds, has marked for me 182 british plants, which are generally considered as varieties, but which have all been ranked by botanists as species; and in making this list he has omitted many trifling varieties, but which nevertheless have been ranked by some botanists as species, and he has entirely omitted several highly polymorphic genera. under genera, including the most polymorphic forms, mr. babington gives 251 species, whereas mr. bentham gives only 112,--a difference of 139 doubtful forms! amongst animals which unite for each birth, and which are highly locomotive, doubtful forms, ranked by one zoologist as a species and by another as a variety, can rarely be found within the same country, but are common in separated areas. how many of those birds and insects in north america and europe, which differ very slightly from each other, have been ranked by one eminent naturalist as undoubted species, and by another as varieties, or, as they are often called, as geographical races! many years ago, when comparing, and seeing others compare, the birds from the separate islands of the galapagos archipelago, both one with another, and with those from the american mainland, i was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction between species and varieties. on the islets of the little madeira group there are many insects which are characterized as varieties in mr. wollaston's admirable work, but which it cannot be doubted would be ranked as distinct species by many entomologists. even ireland has a few animals, now generally regarded as varieties, but which have been ranked as species by some zoologists. several most experienced ornithologists consider our british red grouse as only a strongly-marked race of a norwegian species, whereas the greater number rank it as an undoubted species peculiar to great britain. a wide distance between the homes of two doubtful forms leads many naturalists to rank both as distinct species; but what distance, it has been well asked, will suffice? if that between america and europe is ample, will that between the continent and the azores, or madeira, or the canaries, or ireland, be sufficient? it must be admitted that many forms, considered by highly-competent judges as varieties, have so perfectly the character of species that they are ranked by other highly-competent judges as good and true species. but to discuss whether they are rightly called species or varieties, before any definition of these terms has been generally accepted, is vainly to beat the air. many of the cases of strongly-marked varieties or doubtful species well deserve consideration; for several interesting lines of argument, from geographical distribution, analogical variation, hybridism, etc., have been brought to bear on the attempt to determine their rank. i will here give only a single instance,--the well-known one of the primrose and cowslip, or primula veris and elatior. these plants differ considerably in appearance; they have a different flavour and emit a different odour; they flower at slightly different periods; they grow in somewhat different stations; they ascend mountains to different heights; they have different geographical ranges; and lastly, according to very numerous experiments made during several years by that most careful observer gartner, they can be crossed only with much difficulty. we could hardly wish for better evidence of the two forms being specifically distinct. on the other hand, they are united by many intermediate links, and it is very doubtful whether these links are hybrids; and there is, as it seems to me, an overwhelming amount of experimental evidence, showing that they descend from common parents, and consequently must be ranked as varieties. close investigation, in most cases, will bring naturalists to an agreement how to rank doubtful forms. yet it must be confessed, that it is in the best-known countries that we find the greatest number of forms of doubtful value. i have been struck with the fact, that if any animal or plant in a state of nature be highly useful to man, or from any cause closely attract his attention, varieties of it will almost universally be found recorded. these varieties, moreover, will be often ranked by some authors as species. look at the common oak, how closely it has been studied; yet a german author makes more than a dozen species out of forms, which are very generally considered as varieties; and in this country the highest botanical authorities and practical men can be quoted to show that the sessile and pedunculated oaks are either good and distinct species or mere varieties. when a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms quite unknown to him, he is at first much perplexed to determine what differences to consider as specific, and what as varieties; for he knows nothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the group is subject; and this shows, at least, how very generally there is some variation. but if he confine his attention to one class within one country, he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtful forms. his general tendency will be to make many species, for he will become impressed, just like the pigeon or poultry-fancier before alluded to, with the amount of difference in the forms which he is continually studying; and he has little general knowledge of analogical variation in other groups and in other countries, by which to correct his first impressions. as he extends the range of his observations, he will meet with more cases of difficulty; for he will encounter a greater number of closely-allied forms. but if his observations be widely extended, he will in the end generally be enabled to make up his own mind which to call varieties and which species; but he will succeed in this at the expense of admitting much variation,--and the truth of this admission will often be disputed by other naturalists. when, moreover, he comes to study allied forms brought from countries not now continuous, in which case he can hardly hope to find the intermediate links between his doubtful forms, he will have to trust almost entirely to analogy, and his difficulties will rise to a climax. certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between species and sub-species--that is, the forms which in the opinion of some naturalists come very near to, but do not quite arrive at the rank of species; or, again, between sub-species and well-marked varieties, or between lesser varieties and individual differences. these differences blend into each other in an insensible series; and a series impresses the mind with the idea of an actual passage. hence i look at individual differences, though of small interest to the systematist, as of high importance for us, as being the first step towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in works on natural history. and i look at varieties which are in any degree more distinct and permanent, as steps leading to more strongly marked and more permanent varieties; and at these latter, as leading to sub-species, and to species. the passage from one stage of difference to another and higher stage may be, in some cases, due merely to the long-continued action of different physical conditions in two different regions; but i have not much faith in this view; and i attribute the passage of a variety, from a state in which it differs very slightly from its parent to one in which it differs more, to the action of natural selection in accumulating (as will hereafter be more fully explained) differences of structure in certain definite directions. hence i believe a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species; but whether this belief be justifiable must be judged of by the general weight of the several facts and views given throughout this work. it need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species necessarily attain the rank of species. they may whilst in this incipient state become extinct, or they may endure as varieties for very long periods, as has been shown to be the case by mr. wollaston with the varieties of certain fossil land-shells in madeira. if a variety were to flourish so as to exceed in numbers the parent species, it would then rank as the species, and the species as the variety; or it might come to supplant and exterminate the parent species; or both might co-exist, and both rank as independent species. but we shall hereafter have to return to this subject. from these remarks it will be seen that i look at the term species, as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not essentially differ from the term variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms. the term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for mere convenience sake. guided by theoretical considerations, i thought that some interesting results might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the species which vary most, by tabulating all the varieties in several well-worked floras. at first this seemed a simple task; but mr. h. c. watson, to whom i am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance on this subject, soon convinced me that there were many difficulties, as did subsequently dr. hooker, even in stronger terms. i shall reserve for my future work the discussion of these difficulties, and the tables themselves of the proportional numbers of the varying species. dr. hooker permits me to add, that after having carefully read my manuscript, and examined the tables, he thinks that the following statements are fairly well established. the whole subject, however, treated as it necessarily here is with much brevity, is rather perplexing, and allusions cannot be avoided to the "struggle for existence," "divergence of character," and other questions, hereafter to be discussed. alph. de candolle and others have shown that plants which have very wide ranges generally present varieties; and this might have been expected, as they become exposed to diverse physical conditions, and as they come into competition (which, as we shall hereafter see, is a far more important circumstance) with different sets of organic beings. but my tables further show that, in any limited country, the species which are most common, that is abound most in individuals, and the species which are most widely diffused within their own country (and this is a different consideration from wide range, and to a certain extent from commonness), often give rise to varieties sufficiently well-marked to have been recorded in botanical works. hence it is the most flourishing, or, as they may be called, the dominant species,--those which range widely over the world, are the most diffused in their own country, and are the most numerous in individuals,--which oftenest produce well-marked varieties, or, as i consider them, incipient species. and this, perhaps, might have been anticipated; for, as varieties, in order to become in any degree permanent, necessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of the country, the species which are already dominant will be the most likely to yield offspring which, though in some slight degree modified, will still inherit those advantages that enabled their parents to become dominant over their compatriots. if the plants inhabiting a country and described in any flora be divided into two equal masses, all those in the larger genera being placed on one side, and all those in the smaller genera on the other side, a somewhat larger number of the very common and much diffused or dominant species will be found on the side of the larger genera. this, again, might have been anticipated; for the mere fact of many species of the same genus inhabiting any country, shows that there is something in the organic or inorganic conditions of that country favourable to the genus; and, consequently, we might have expected to have found in the larger genera, or those including many species, a large proportional number of dominant species. but so many causes tend to obscure this result, that i am surprised that my tables show even a small majority on the side of the larger genera. i will here allude to only two causes of obscurity. fresh-water and salt-loving plants have generally very wide ranges and are much diffused, but this seems to be connected with the nature of the stations inhabited by them, and has little or no relation to the size of the genera to which the species belong. again, plants low in the scale of organisation are generally much more widely diffused than plants higher in the scale; and here again there is no close relation to the size of the genera. the cause of lowly-organised plants ranging widely will be discussed in our chapter on geographical distribution. from looking at species as only strongly-marked and well-defined varieties, i was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera in each country would oftener present varieties, than the species of the smaller genera; for wherever many closely related species (i.e. species of the same genus) have been formed, many varieties or incipient species ought, as a general rule, to be now forming. where many large trees grow, we expect to find saplings. where many species of a genus have been formed through variation, circumstances have been favourable for variation; and hence we might expect that the circumstances would generally be still favourable to variation. on the other hand, if we look at each species as a special act of creation, there is no apparent reason why more varieties should occur in a group having many species, than in one having few. to test the truth of this anticipation i have arranged the plants of twelve countries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts, into two nearly equal masses, the species of the larger genera on one side, and those of the smaller genera on the other side, and it has invariably proved to be the case that a larger proportion of the species on the side of the larger genera present varieties, than on the side of the smaller genera. moreover, the species of the large genera which present any varieties, invariably present a larger average number of varieties than do the species of the small genera. both these results follow when another division is made, and when all the smallest genera, with from only one to four species, are absolutely excluded from the tables. these facts are of plain signification on the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties; for wherever many species of the same genus have been formed, or where, if we may use the expression, the manufactory of species has been active, we ought generally to find the manufactory still in action, more especially as we have every reason to believe the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow one. and this certainly is the case, if varieties be looked at as incipient species; for my tables clearly show as a general rule that, wherever many species of a genus have been formed, the species of that genus present a number of varieties, that is of incipient species, beyond the average. it is not that all large genera are now varying much, and are thus increasing in the number of their species, or that no small genera are now varying and increasing; for if this had been so, it would have been fatal to my theory; inasmuch as geology plainly tells us that small genera have in the lapse of time often increased greatly in size; and that large genera have often come to their maxima, declined, and disappeared. all that we want to show is, that where many species of a genus have been formed, on an average many are still forming; and this holds good. there are other relations between the species of large genera and their recorded varieties which deserve notice. we have seen that there is no infallible criterion by which to distinguish species and well-marked varieties; and in those cases in which intermediate links have not been found between doubtful forms, naturalists are compelled to come to a determination by the amount of difference between them, judging by analogy whether or not the amount suffices to raise one or both to the rank of species. hence the amount of difference is one very important criterion in settling whether two forms should be ranked as species or varieties. now fries has remarked in regard to plants, and westwood in regard to insects, that in large genera the amount of difference between the species is often exceedingly small. i have endeavoured to test this numerically by averages, and, as far as my imperfect results go, they always confirm the view. i have also consulted some sagacious and most experienced observers, and, after deliberation, they concur in this view. in this respect, therefore, the species of the larger genera resemble varieties, more than do the species of the smaller genera. or the case may be put in another way, and it may be said, that in the larger genera, in which a number of varieties or incipient species greater than the average are now manufacturing, many of the species already manufactured still to a certain extent resemble varieties, for they differ from each other by a less than usual amount of difference. moreover, the species of the large genera are related to each other, in the same manner as the varieties of any one species are related to each other. no naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are equally distinct from each other; they may generally be divided into sub-genera, or sections, or lesser groups. as fries has well remarked, little groups of species are generally clustered like satellites around certain other species. and what are varieties but groups of forms, unequally related to each other, and clustered round certain forms--that is, round their parent-species? undoubtedly there is one most important point of difference between varieties and species; namely, that the amount of difference between varieties, when compared with each other or with their parent-species, is much less than that between the species of the same genus. but when we come to discuss the principle, as i call it, of divergence of character, we shall see how this may be explained, and how the lesser differences between varieties will tend to increase into the greater differences between species. there is one other point which seems to me worth notice. varieties generally have much restricted ranges: this statement is indeed scarcely more than a truism, for if a variety were found to have a wider range than that of its supposed parent-species, their denominations ought to be reversed. but there is also reason to believe, that those species which are very closely allied to other species, and in so far resemble varieties, often have much restricted ranges. for instance, mr. h. c. watson has marked for me in the well-sifted london catalogue of plants (4th edition) 63 plants which are therein ranked as species, but which he considers as so closely allied to other species as to be of doubtful value: these 63 reputed species range on an average over 6.9 of the provinces into which mr. watson has divided great britain. now, in this same catalogue, 53 acknowledged varieties are recorded, and these range over 7.7 provinces; whereas, the species to which these varieties belong range over 14.3 provinces. so that the acknowledged varieties have very nearly the same restricted average range, as have those very closely allied forms, marked for me by mr. watson as doubtful species, but which are almost universally ranked by british botanists as good and true species. finally, then, varieties have the same general characters as species, for they cannot be distinguished from species,--except, firstly, by the discovery of intermediate linking forms, and the occurrence of such links cannot affect the actual characters of the forms which they connect; and except, secondly, by a certain amount of difference, for two forms, if differing very little, are generally ranked as varieties, notwithstanding that intermediate linking forms have not been discovered; but the amount of difference considered necessary to give to two forms the rank of species is quite indefinite. in genera having more than the average number of species in any country, the species of these genera have more than the average number of varieties. in large genera the species are apt to be closely, but unequally, allied together, forming little clusters round certain species. species very closely allied to other species apparently have restricted ranges. in all these several respects the species of large genera present a strong analogy with varieties. and we can clearly understand these analogies, if species have once existed as varieties, and have thus originated: whereas, these analogies are utterly inexplicable if each species has been independently created. we have, also, seen that it is the most flourishing and dominant species of the larger genera which on an average vary most; and varieties, as we shall hereafter see, tend to become converted into new and distinct species. the larger genera thus tend to become larger; and throughout nature the forms of life which are now dominant tend to become still more dominant by leaving many modified and dominant descendants. but by steps hereafter to be explained, the larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera. and thus, the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into groups subordinate to groups. 3. struggle for existence. bears on natural selection. the

the struggle for existence bears on natural selection. it has been seen in the last chapter that amongst organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual variability; indeed i am not aware that this has ever been disputed. it is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called species or sub-species or varieties; what rank, for instance, the two or three hundred doubtful forms of british plants are entitled to hold, if the existence of any well-marked varieties be admitted. but the mere existence of individual variability and of some few well-marked varieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work, helps us but little in understanding how species arise in nature. how have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part, and to the conditions of life, and of one distinct organic being to another being, been perfected? we see these beautiful co-adaptations most plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe; and only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water; in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic world. again, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which i have called incipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinct species, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far more than do the varieties of the same species? how do those groups of species, which constitute what are called distinct genera, and which differ from each other more than do the species of the same genus, arise? all these results, as we shall more fully see in the next chapter, follow inevitably from the struggle for life. owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring. the offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small number can survive. i have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of natural selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. we have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results, and can adapt organic beings to his own uses, through the accumulation of slight but useful variations, given to him by the hand of nature. but natural selection, as we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for action, and is as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as the works of nature are to those of art. we will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence. in my future work this subject shall be treated, as it well deserves, at much greater length. the elder de candolle and lyell have largely and philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe competition. in regard to plants, no one has treated this subject with more spirit and ability than w. herbert, dean of manchester, evidently the result of his great horticultural knowledge. nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or more difficult--at least i have found it so--than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind. yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind, i am convinced that the whole economy of nature, with every fact on distribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood. we behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see, or we forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that though food may be now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year. i should premise that i use the term struggle for existence in a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another, and including (which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny. two canine animals in a time of dearth, may be truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live. but a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the drought, though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the moisture. a plant which annually produces a thousand seeds, of which on an average only one comes to maturity, may be more truly said to struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already clothe the ground. the missletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle with these trees, for if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree, it will languish and die. but several seedling missletoes, growing close together on the same branch, may more truly be said to struggle with each other. as the missletoe is disseminated by birds, its existence depends on birds; and it may metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, in order to tempt birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds rather than those of other plants. in these several senses, which pass into each other, i use for convenience sake the general term of struggle for existence. a struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which all organic beings tend to increase. every being, which during its natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer destruction during some period of its life, and during some season or occasional year, otherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the product. hence, as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence, either one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life. it is the doctrine of malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them. there is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate, that if not destroyed, the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. even slow-breeding man has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in a few thousand years, there would literally not be standing room for his progeny. linnaeus has calculated that if an annual plant produced only two seeds--and there is no plant so unproductive as this--and their seedlings next year produced two, and so on, then in twenty years there would be a million plants. the elephant is reckoned to be the slowest breeder of all known animals, and i have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase: it will be under the mark to assume that it breeds when thirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing forth three pair of young in this interval; if this be so, at the end of the fifth century there would be alive fifteen million elephants, descended from the first pair. but we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical calculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three following seasons. still more striking is the evidence from our domestic animals of many kinds which have run wild in several parts of the world: if the statements of the rate of increase of slow-breeding cattle and horses in south america, and latterly in australia, had not been well authenticated, they would have been quite incredible. so it is with plants: cases could be given of introduced plants which have become common throughout whole islands in a period of less than ten years. several of the plants now most numerous over the wide plains of la plata, clothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of all other plants, have been introduced from europe; and there are plants which now range in india, as i hear from dr. falconer, from cape comorin to the himalaya, which have been imported from america since its discovery. in such cases, and endless instances could be given, no one supposes that the fertility of these animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily increased in any sensible degree. the obvious explanation is that the conditions of life have been very favourable, and that there has consequently been less destruction of the old and young, and that nearly all the young have been enabled to breed. in such cases the geometrical ratio of increase, the result of which never fails to be surprising, simply explains the extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion of naturalised productions in their new homes. in a state of nature almost every plant produces seed, and amongst animals there are very few which do not annually pair. hence we may confidently assert, that all plants and animals are tending to increase at a geometrical ratio, that all would most rapidly stock every station in which they could any how exist, and that the geometrical tendency to increase must be checked by destruction at some period of life. our familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends, i think, to mislead us: we see no great destruction falling on them, and we forget that thousands are annually slaughtered for food, and that in a state of nature an equal number would have somehow to be disposed of. the only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs or seeds by the thousand, and those which produce extremely few, is, that the slow-breeders would require a few more years to people, under favourable conditions, a whole district, let it be ever so large. the condor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score, and yet in the same country the condor may be the more numerous of the two: the fulmar petrel lays but one egg, yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird in the world. one fly deposits hundreds of eggs, and another, like the hippobosca, a single one; but this difference does not determine how many individuals of the two species can be supported in a district. a large number of eggs is of some importance to those species, which depend on a rapidly fluctuating amount of food, for it allows them rapidly to increase in number. but the real importance of a large number of eggs or seeds is to make up for much destruction at some period of life; and this period in the great majority of cases is an early one. if an animal can in any way protect its own eggs or young, a small number may be produced, and yet the average stock be fully kept up; but if many eggs or young are destroyed, many must be produced, or the species will become extinct. it would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree, which lived on an average for a thousand years, if a single seed were produced once in a thousand years, supposing that this seed were never destroyed, and could be ensured to germinate in a fitting place. so that in all cases, the average number of any animal or plant depends only indirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds. in looking at nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing considerations always in mind--never to forget that every single organic being around us may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in numbers; that each lives by a struggle at some period of its life; that heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old, during each generation or at recurrent intervals. lighten any check, mitigate the destruction ever so little, and the number of the species will almost instantaneously increase to any amount. the face of nature may be compared to a yielding surface, with ten thousand sharp wedges packed close together and driven inwards by incessant blows, sometimes one wedge being struck, and then another with greater force. what checks the natural tendency of each species to increase in number is most obscure. look at the most vigorous species; by as much as it swarms in numbers, by so much will its tendency to increase be still further increased. we know not exactly what the checks are in even one single instance. nor will this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant we are on this head, even in regard to mankind, so incomparably better known than any other animal. this subject has been ably treated by several authors, and i shall, in my future work, discuss some of the checks at considerable length, more especially in regard to the feral animals of south america. here i will make only a few remarks, just to recall to the reader's mind some of the chief points. eggs or very young animals seem generally to suffer most, but this is not invariably the case. with plants there is a vast destruction of seeds, but, from some observations which i have made, i believe that it is the seedlings which suffer most from germinating in ground already thickly stocked with other plants. seedlings, also, are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies; for instance, on a piece of ground three feet long and two wide, dug and cleared, and where there could be no choking from other plants, i marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up, and out of the 357 no less than 295 were destroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects. if turf which has long been mown, and the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds, be let to grow, the more vigorous plants gradually kill the less vigorous, though fully grown, plants: thus out of twenty species growing on a little plot of turf (three feet by four) nine species perished from the other species being allowed to grow up freely. the amount of food for each species of course gives the extreme limit to which each can increase; but very frequently it is not the obtaining food, but the serving as prey to other animals, which determines the average numbers of a species. thus, there seems to be little doubt that the stock of partridges, grouse, and hares on any large estate depends chiefly on the destruction of vermin. if not one head of game were shot during the next twenty years in england, and, at the same time, if no vermin were destroyed, there would, in all probability, be less game than at present, although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now annually killed. on the other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant and rhinoceros, none are destroyed by beasts of prey: even the tiger in india most rarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam. climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a species, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought, i believe to be the most effective of all checks. i estimated that the winter of 1854-55 destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and this is a tremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent. is an extraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man. the action of climate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for existence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it brings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether of the same or of distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of food. even when climate, for instance extreme cold, acts directly, it will be the least vigorous, or those which have got least food through the advancing winter, which will suffer most. when we travel from south to north, or from a damp region to a dry, we invariably see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer, and finally disappearing; and the change of climate being conspicuous, we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action. but this is a very false view: we forget that each species, even where it most abounds, is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life, from enemies or from competitors for the same place and food; and if these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change of climate, they will increase in numbers, and, as each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species will decrease. when we travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers, we may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being favoured, as in this one being hurt. so it is when we travel northward, but in a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of species of all kinds, and therefore of competitors, decreases northwards; hence in going northward, or in ascending a mountain, we far oftener meet with stunted forms, due to the directly injurious action of climate, than we do in proceeding southwards or in descending a mountain. when we reach the arctic regions, or snow-capped summits, or absolute deserts, the struggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements. that climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species, we may clearly see in the prodigious number of plants in our gardens which can perfectly well endure our climate, but which never become naturalised, for they cannot compete with our native plants, nor resist destruction by our native animals. when a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases inordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics--at least, this seems generally to occur with our game animals--often ensue: and here we have a limiting check independent of the struggle for life. but even some of these so-called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms, which have from some cause, possibly in part through facility of diffusion amongst the crowded animals, been disproportionably favoured: and here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey. on the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of the same species, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is absolutely necessary for its preservation. thus we can easily raise plenty of corn and rape-seed, etc., in our fields, because the seeds are in great excess compared with the number of birds which feed on them; nor can the birds, though having a superabundance of food at this one season, increase in number proportionally to the supply of seed, as their numbers are checked during winter: but any one who has tried, knows how troublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants in a garden; i have in this case lost every single seed. this view of the necessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation, explains, i believe, some singular facts in nature, such as that of very rare plants being sometimes extremely abundant in the few spots where they do occur; and that of some social plants being social, that is, abounding in individuals, even on the extreme confines of their range. for in such cases, we may believe, that a plant could exist only where the conditions of its life were so favourable that many could exist together, and thus save each other from utter destruction. i should add that the good effects of frequent intercrossing, and the ill effects of close interbreeding, probably come into play in some of these cases; but on this intricate subject i will not here enlarge. many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the checks and relations between organic beings, which have to struggle together in the same country. i will give only a single instance, which, though a simple one, has interested me. in staffordshire, on the estate of a relation where i had ample means of investigation, there was a large and extremely barren heath, which had never been touched by the hand of man; but several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had been enclosed twenty-five years previously and planted with scotch fir. the change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath was most remarkable, more than is generally seen in passing from one quite different soil to another: not only the proportional numbers of the heath-plants were wholly changed, but twelve species of plants (not counting grasses and carices) flourished in the plantations, which could not be found on the heath. the effect on the insects must have been still greater, for six insectivorous birds were very common in the plantations, which were not to be seen on the heath; and the heath was frequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds. here we see how potent has been the effect of the introduction of a single tree, nothing whatever else having been done, with the exception that the land had been enclosed, so that cattle could not enter. but how important an element enclosure is, i plainly saw near farnham, in surrey. here there are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of old scotch firs on the distant hill-tops: within the last ten years large spaces have been enclosed, and self-sown firs are now springing up in multitudes, so close together that all cannot live. when i ascertained that these young trees had not been sown or planted, i was so much surprised at their numbers that i went to several points of view, whence i could examine hundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath, and literally i could not see a single scotch fir, except the old planted clumps. but on looking closely between the stems of the heath, i found a multitude of seedlings and little trees, which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. in one square yard, at a point some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps, i counted thirty-two little trees; and one of them, judging from the rings of growth, had during twenty-six years tried to raise its head above the stems of the heath, and had failed. no wonder that, as soon as the land was enclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs. yet the heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely and effectually searched it for food. here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the scotch fir; but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence of cattle. perhaps paraguay offers the most curious instance of this; for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though they swarm southward and northward in a feral state; and azara and rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in paraguay of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when first born. the increase of these flies, numerous as they are, must be habitually checked by some means, probably by birds. hence, if certain insectivorous birds (whose numbers are probably regulated by hawks or beasts of prey) were to increase in paraguay, the flies would decrease--then cattle and horses would become feral, and this would certainly greatly alter (as indeed i have observed in parts of south america) the vegetation: this again would largely affect the insects; and this, as we just have seen in staffordshire, the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in ever-increasing circles of complexity. we began this series by insectivorous birds, and we have ended with them. not that in nature the relations can ever be as simple as this. battle within battle must ever be recurring with varying success; and yet in the long-run the forces are so nicely balanced, that the face of nature remains uniform for long periods of time, though assuredly the merest trifle would often give the victory to one organic being over another. nevertheless so profound is our ignorance, and so high our presumption, that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an organic being; and as we do not see the cause, we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world, or invent laws on the duration of the forms of life! i am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals, most remote in the scale of nature, are bound together by a web of complex relations. i shall hereafter have occasion to show that the exotic lobelia fulgens, in this part of england, is never visited by insects, and consequently, from its peculiar structure, never can set a seed. many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollen-masses and thus to fertilise them. i have, also, reason to believe that humble-bees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the heartsease (viola tricolor), for other bees do not visit this flower. from experiments which i have tried, i have found that the visits of bees, if not indispensable, are at least highly beneficial to the fertilisation of our clovers; but humble-bees alone visit the common red clover (trifolium pratense), as other bees cannot reach the nectar. hence i have very little doubt, that if the whole genus of humble-bees became extinct or very rare in england, the heartsease and red clover would become very rare, or wholly disappear. the number of humble-bees in any district depends in a great degree on the number of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and mr. h. newman, who has long attended to the habits of humble-bees, believes that "more than two thirds of them are thus destroyed all over england." now the number of mice is largely dependent, as every one knows, on the number of cats; and mr. newman says, "near villages and small towns i have found the nests of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which i attribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice." hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district! in the case of every species, many different checks, acting at different periods of life, and during different seasons or years, probably come into play; some one check or some few being generally the most potent, but all concurring in determining the average number or even the existence of the species. in some cases it can be shown that widely-different checks act on the same species in different districts. when we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank, we are tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we call chance. but how false a view is this! every one has heard that when an american forest is cut down, a very different vegetation springs up; but it has been observed that the trees now growing on the ancient indian mounds, in the southern united states, display the same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the surrounding virgin forests. what a struggle between the several kinds of trees must here have gone on during long centuries, each annually scattering its seeds by the thousand; what war between insect and insect--between insects, snails, and other animals with birds and beasts of prey--all striving to increase, and all feeding on each other or on the trees or their seeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which first clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees! throw up a handful of feathers, and all must fall to the ground according to definite laws; but how simple is this problem compared to the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have determined, in the course of centuries, the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old indian ruins! the dependency of one organic being on another, as of a parasite on its prey, lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature. this is often the case with those which may strictly be said to struggle with each other for existence, as in the case of locusts and grass-feeding quadrupeds. but the struggle almost invariably will be most severe between the individuals of the same species, for they frequent the same districts, require the same food, and are exposed to the same dangers. in the case of varieties of the same species, the struggle will generally be almost equally severe, and we sometimes see the contest soon decided: for instance, if several varieties of wheat be sown together, and the mixed seed be resown, some of the varieties which best suit the soil or climate, or are naturally the most fertile, will beat the others and so yield more seed, and will consequently in a few years quite supplant the other varieties. to keep up a mixed stock of even such extremely close varieties as the variously coloured sweet-peas, they must be each year harvested separately, and the seed then mixed in due proportion, otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily decrease in numbers and disappear. so again with the varieties of sheep: it has been asserted that certain mountain-varieties will starve out other mountain-varieties, so that they cannot be kept together. the same result has followed from keeping together different varieties of the medicinal leech. it may even be doubted whether the varieties of any one of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength, habits, and constitution, that the original proportions of a mixed stock could be kept up for half a dozen generations, if they were allowed to struggle together, like beings in a state of nature, and if the seed or young were not annually sorted. as species of the same genus have usually, though by no means invariably, some similarity in habits and constitution, and always in structure, the struggle will generally be more severe between species of the same genus, when they come into competition with each other, than between species of distinct genera. we see this in the recent extension over parts of the united states of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of another species. the recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of scotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush. how frequently we hear of one species of rat taking the place of another species under the most different climates! in russia the small asiatic cockroach has everywhere driven before it its great congener. one species of charlock will supplant another, and so in other cases. we can dimly see why the competition should be most severe between allied forms, which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature; but probably in no one case could we precisely say why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle of life. a corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing remarks, namely, that the structure of every organic being is related, in the most essential yet often hidden manner, to that of all other organic beings, with which it comes into competition for food or residence, or from which it has to escape, or on which it preys. this is obvious in the structure of the teeth and talons of the tiger; and in that of the legs and claws of the parasite which clings to the hair on the tiger's body. but in the beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion, and in the flattened and fringed legs of the water-beetle, the relation seems at first confined to the elements of air and water. yet the advantage of plumed seeds no doubt stands in the closest relation to the land being already thickly clothed by other plants; so that the seeds may be widely distributed and fall on unoccupied ground. in the water-beetle, the structure of its legs, so well adapted for diving, allows it to compete with other aquatic insects, to hunt for its own prey, and to escape serving as prey to other animals. the store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at first sight to have no sort of relation to other plants. but from the strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds (as peas and beans), when sown in the midst of long grass, i suspect that the chief use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the young seedling, whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously all around. look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or quadruple its numbers? we know that it can perfectly well withstand a little more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for elsewhere it ranges into slightly hotter or colder, damper or drier districts. in this case we can clearly see that if we wished in imagination to give the plant the power of increasing in number, we should have to give it some advantage over its competitors, or over the animals which preyed on it. on the confines of its geographical range, a change of constitution with respect to climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant; but we have reason to believe that only a few plants or animals range so far, that they are destroyed by the rigour of the climate alone. not until we reach the extreme confines of life, in the arctic regions or on the borders of an utter desert, will competition cease. the land may be extremely cold or dry, yet there will be competition between some few species, or between the individuals of the same species, for the warmest or dampest spots. hence, also, we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new country amongst new competitors, though the climate may be exactly the same as in its former home, yet the conditions of its life will generally be changed in an essential manner. if we wished to increase its average numbers in its new home, we should have to modify it in a different way to what we should have done in its native country; for we should have to give it some advantage over a different set of competitors or enemies. it is good thus to try in our imagination to give any form some advantage over another. probably in no single instance should we know what to do, so as to succeed. it will convince us of our ignorance on the mutual relations of all organic beings; a conviction as necessary, as it seems to be difficult to acquire. all that we can do, is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being is striving to increase at a geometrical ratio; that each at some period of its life, during some season of the year, during each generation or at intervals, has to struggle for life, and to suffer great destruction. when we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply. 4. natural selection. natural selection: its power compared with man's selection, its power on characters of trifling importance, its power at all ages and on both sexes. sexual selection. on the generality of intercrosses between individuals of the same species. circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural selection, namely, intercrossing, isolation, number of individuals. slow action. extinction caused by natural selection. divergence of character, related to the diversity of inhabitants of any small area, and to naturalisation. action of natural selection, through divergence of character and extinction, on the descendants from a common parent. explains the grouping of all organic beings. how will the struggle for existence, discussed too briefly in the last chapter, act in regard to variation? can the principle of selection, which we have seen is so potent in the hands of man, apply in nature? i think we shall see that it can act most effectually. let it be borne in mind in what an endless number of strange peculiarities our domestic productions, and, in a lesser degree, those under nature, vary; and how strong the hereditary tendency is. under domestication, it may be truly said that the whole organisation becomes in some degree plastic. let it be borne in mind how infinitely complex and close-fitting are the mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life. can it, then, be thought improbable, seeing that variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other variations useful in some way to each being in the great and complex battle of life, should sometimes occur in the course of thousands of generations? if such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind? on the other hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. this preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, i call natural selection. variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic. we shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for instance, of climate. the proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change, and some species might become extinct. we may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would most seriously affect many of the others. if the country were open on its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. but in the case of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up, if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area been open to immigration, these same places would have been seized on by intruders. in such case, every slight modification, which in the course of ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved; and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of improvement. we have reason to believe, as stated in the first chapter, that a change in the conditions of life, by specially acting on the reproductive system, causes or increases variability; and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a change, and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by giving a better chance of profitable variations occurring; and unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing. not that, as i believe, any extreme amount of variability is necessary; as man can certainly produce great results by adding up in any given direction mere individual differences, so could nature, but far more easily, from having incomparably longer time at her disposal. nor do i believe that any great physical change, as of climate, or any unusual degree of isolation to check immigration, is actually necessary to produce new and unoccupied places for natural selection to fill up by modifying and improving some of the varying inhabitants. for as all the inhabitants of each country are struggling together with nicely balanced forces, extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits of one inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others; and still further modifications of the same kind would often still further increase the advantage. no country can be named in which all the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and to the physical conditions under which they live, that none of them could anyhow be improved; for in all countries, the natives have been so far conquered by naturalised productions, that they have allowed foreigners to take firm possession of the land. and as foreigners have thus everywhere beaten some of the natives, we may safely conclude that the natives might have been modified with advantage, so as to have better resisted such intruders. as man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not nature effect? man can act only on external and visible characters: nature cares nothing for appearances, except in so far as they may be useful to any being. she can act on every internal organ, on every shade of constitutional difference, on the whole machinery of life. man selects only for his own good; nature only for that of the being which she tends. every selected character is fully exercised by her; and the being is placed under well-suited conditions of life. man keeps the natives of many climates in the same country; he seldom exercises each selected character in some peculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not exercise a long-backed or long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the same climate. he does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the females. he does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals, but protects during each varying season, as far as lies in his power, all his productions. he often begins his selection by some half-monstrous form; or at least by some modification prominent enough to catch his eye, or to be plainly useful to him. under nature, the slightest difference of structure or constitution may well turn the nicely-balanced scale in the struggle for life, and so be preserved. how fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! how short his time! and consequently how poor will his products be, compared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological periods. can we wonder, then, that nature's productions should be far "truer" in character than man's productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship? it may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. we see nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages, and then so imperfect is our view into long past geological ages, that we only see that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were. although natural selection can act only through and for the good of each being, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to consider as of very trifling importance, may thus be acted on. when we see leaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the red-grouse the colour of heather, and the black-grouse that of peaty earth, we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them from danger. grouse, if not destroyed at some period of their lives, would increase in countless numbers; they are known to suffer largely from birds of prey; and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey,--so much so, that on parts of the continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons, as being the most liable to destruction. hence i can see no reason to doubt that natural selection might be most effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once acquired, true and constant. nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of any particular colour would produce little effect: we should remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy every lamb with the faintest trace of black. in plants the down on the fruit and the colour of the flesh are considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling importance: yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist, downing, that in the united states smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle, a curculio, than those with down; that purple plums suffer far more from a certain disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease attacks yellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh. if, with all the aids of art, these slight differences make a great difference in cultivating the several varieties, assuredly, in a state of nature, where the trees would have to struggle with other trees and with a host of enemies, such differences would effectually settle which variety, whether a smooth or downy, a yellow or purple fleshed fruit, should succeed. in looking at many small points of difference between species, which, as far as our ignorance permits us to judge, seem to be quite unimportant, we must not forget that climate, food, etc., probably produce some slight and direct effect. it is, however, far more necessary to bear in mind that there are many unknown laws of correlation of growth, which, when one part of the organisation is modified through variation, and the modifications are accumulated by natural selection for the good of the being, will cause other modifications, often of the most unexpected nature. as we see that those variations which under domestication appear at any particular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at the same period;--for instance, in the seeds of the many varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants; in the caterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm; in the eggs of poultry, and in the colour of the down of their chickens; in the horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly adult;--so in a state of nature, natural selection will be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at any age, by the accumulation of profitable variations at that age, and by their inheritance at a corresponding age. if it profit a plant to have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind, i can see no greater difficulty in this being effected through natural selection, than in the cotton-planter increasing and improving by selection the down in the pods on his cotton-trees. natural selection may modify and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies, wholly different from those which concern the mature insect. these modifications will no doubt affect, through the laws of correlation, the structure of the adult; and probably in the case of those insects which live only for a few hours, and which never feed, a large part of their structure is merely the correlated result of successive changes in the structure of their larvae. so, conversely, modifications in the adult will probably often affect the structure of the larva; but in all cases natural selection will ensure that modifications consequent on other modifications at a different period of life, shall not be in the least degree injurious: for if they became so, they would cause the extinction of the species. natural selection will modify the structure of the young in relation to the parent, and of the parent in relation to the young. in social animals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of the community; if each in consequence profits by the selected change. what natural selection cannot do, is to modify the structure of one species, without giving it any advantage, for the good of another species; and though statements to this effect may be found in works of natural history, i cannot find one case which will bear investigation. a structure used only once in an animal's whole life, if of high importance to it, might be modified to any extent by natural selection; for instance, the great jaws possessed by certain insects, and used exclusively for opening the cocoon--or the hard tip to the beak of nestling birds, used for breaking the egg. it has been asserted, that of the best short-beaked tumbler-pigeons more perish in the egg than are able to get out of it; so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching. now, if nature had to make the beak of a full-grown pigeon very short for the bird's own advantage, the process of modification would be very slow, and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection of the young birds within the egg, which had the most powerful and hardest beaks, for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish: or, more delicate and more easily broken shells might be selected, the thickness of the shell being known to vary like every other structure. sexual selection. inasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in one sex and become hereditarily attached to that sex, the same fact probably occurs under nature, and if so, natural selection will be able to modify one sex in its functional relations to the other sex, or in relation to wholly different habits of life in the two sexes, as is sometimes the case with insects. and this leads me to say a few words on what i call sexual selection. this depends, not on a struggle for existence, but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females; the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring. sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than natural selection. generally, the most vigorous males, those which are best fitted for their places in nature, will leave most progeny. but in many cases, victory will depend not on general vigour, but on having special weapons, confined to the male sex. a hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of leaving offspring. sexual selection by always allowing the victor to breed might surely give indomitable courage, length to the spur, and strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg, as well as the brutal cock-fighter, who knows well that he can improve his breed by careful selection of the best cocks. how low in the scale of nature this law of battle descends, i know not; male alligators have been described as fighting, bellowing, and whirling round, like indians in a war-dance, for the possession of the females; male salmons have been seen fighting all day long; male stag-beetles often bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males. the war is, perhaps, severest between the males of polygamous animals, and these seem oftenest provided with special weapons. the males of carnivorous animals are already well armed; though to them and to others, special means of defence may be given through means of sexual selection, as the mane to the lion, the shoulder-pad to the boar, and the hooked jaw to the male salmon; for the shield may be as important for victory, as the sword or spear. amongst birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character. all those who have attended to the subject, believe that there is the severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract by singing the females. the rock-thrush of guiana, birds of paradise, and some others, congregate; and successive males display their gorgeous plumage and perform strange antics before the females, which standing by as spectators, at last choose the most attractive partner. those who have closely attended to birds in confinement well know that they often take individual preferences and dislikes: thus sir r. heron has described how one pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen birds. it may appear childish to attribute any effect to such apparently weak means: i cannot here enter on the details necessary to support this view; but if man can in a short time give elegant carriage and beauty to his bantams, according to his standard of beauty, i can see no good reason to doubt that female birds, by selecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious or beautiful males, according to their standard of beauty, might produce a marked effect. i strongly suspect that some well-known laws with respect to the plumage of male and female birds, in comparison with the plumage of the young, can be explained on the view of plumage having been chiefly modified by sexual selection, acting when the birds have come to the breeding age or during the breeding season; the modifications thus produced being inherited at corresponding ages or seasons, either by the males alone, or by the males and females; but i have not space here to enter on this subject. thus it is, as i believe, that when the males and females of any animal have the same general habits of life, but differ in structure, colour, or ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection; that is, individual males have had, in successive generations, some slight advantage over other males, in their weapons, means of defence, or charms; and have transmitted these advantages to their male offspring. yet, i would not wish to attribute all such sexual differences to this agency: for we see peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex in our domestic animals (as the wattle in male carriers, horn-like protuberances in the cocks of certain fowls, etc.), which we cannot believe to be either useful to the males in battle, or attractive to the females. we see analogous cases under nature, for instance, the tuft of hair on the breast of the turkey-cock, which can hardly be either useful or ornamental to this bird;--indeed, had the tuft appeared under domestication, it would have been called a monstrosity. illustrations of the action of natural selection. in order to make it clear how, as i believe, natural selection acts, i must beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations. let us take the case of a wolf, which preys on various animals, securing some by craft, some by strength, and some by fleetness; and let us suppose that the fleetest prey, a deer for instance, had from any change in the country increased in numbers, or that other prey had decreased in numbers, during that season of the year when the wolf is hardest pressed for food. i can under such circumstances see no reason to doubt that the swiftest and slimmest wolves would have the best chance of surviving, and so be preserved or selected,--provided always that they retained strength to master their prey at this or at some other period of the year, when they might be compelled to prey on other animals. i can see no more reason to doubt this, than that man can improve the fleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection, or by that unconscious selection which results from each man trying to keep the best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed. even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on which our wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an innate tendency to pursue certain kinds of prey. nor can this be thought very improbable; for we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our domestic animals; one cat, for instance, taking to catch rats, another mice; one cat, according to mr. st. john, bringing home winged game, another hares or rabbits, and another hunting on marshy ground and almost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes. the tendency to catch rats rather than mice is known to be inherited. now, if any slight innate change of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf, it would have the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring. some of its young would probably inherit the same habits or structure, and by the repetition of this process, a new variety might be formed which would either supplant or coexist with the parent-form of wolf. or, again, the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district, and those frequenting the lowlands, would naturally be forced to hunt different prey; and from the continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites, two varieties might slowly be formed. these varieties would cross and blend where they met; but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soon have to return. i may add, that, according to mr. pierce, there are two varieties of the wolf inhabiting the catskill mountains in the united states, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and the other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks the shepherd's flocks. let us now take a more complex case. certain plants excrete a sweet juice, apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from their sap: this is effected by glands at the base of the stipules in some leguminosae, and at the back of the leaf of the common laurel. this juice, though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects. let us now suppose a little sweet juice or nectar to be excreted by the inner bases of the petals of a flower. in this case insects in seeking the nectar would get dusted with pollen, and would certainly often transport the pollen from one flower to the stigma of another flower. the flowers of two distinct individuals of the same species would thus get crossed; and the act of crossing, we have good reason to believe (as will hereafter be more fully alluded to), would produce very vigorous seedlings, which consequently would have the best chance of flourishing and surviving. some of these seedlings would probably inherit the nectar-excreting power. those individual flowers which had the largest glands or nectaries, and which excreted most nectar, would be oftenest visited by insects, and would be oftenest crossed; and so in the long-run would gain the upper hand. those flowers, also, which had their stamens and pistils placed, in relation to the size and habits of the particular insects which visited them, so as to favour in any degree the transportal of their pollen from flower to flower, would likewise be favoured or selected. we might have taken the case of insects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar; and as pollen is formed for the sole object of fertilisation, its destruction appears a simple loss to the plant; yet if a little pollen were carried, at first occasionally and then habitually, by the pollen-devouring insects from flower to flower, and a cross thus effected, although nine-tenths of the pollen were destroyed, it might still be a great gain to the plant; and those individuals which produced more and more pollen, and had larger and larger anthers, would be selected. when our plant, by this process of the continued preservation or natural selection of more and more attractive flowers, had been rendered highly attractive to insects, they would, unintentionally on their part, regularly carry pollen from flower to flower; and that they can most effectually do this, i could easily show by many striking instances. i will give only one--not as a very striking case, but as likewise illustrating one step in the separation of the sexes of plants, presently to be alluded to. some holly-trees bear only male flowers, which have four stamens producing rather a small quantity of pollen, and a rudimentary pistil; other holly-trees bear only female flowers; these have a full-sized pistil, and four stamens with shrivelled anthers, in which not a grain of pollen can be detected. having found a female tree exactly sixty yards from a male tree, i put the stigmas of twenty flowers, taken from different branches, under the microscope, and on all, without exception, there were pollen-grains, and on some a profusion of pollen. as the wind had set for several days from the female to the male tree, the pollen could not thus have been carried. the weather had been cold and boisterous, and therefore not favourable to bees, nevertheless every female flower which i examined had been effectually fertilised by the bees, accidentally dusted with pollen, having flown from tree to tree in search of nectar. but to return to our imaginary case: as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive to insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower, another process might commence. no naturalist doubts the advantage of what has been called the "physiological division of labour;" hence we may believe that it would be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one flower or on one whole plant, and pistils alone in another flower or on another plant. in plants under culture and placed under new conditions of life, sometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs become more or less impotent; now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree under nature, then as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to flower, and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would be advantageous on the principle of the division of labour, individuals with this tendency more and more increased, would be continually favoured or selected, until at last a complete separation of the sexes would be effected. let us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects in our imaginary case: we may suppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by continued selection, to be a common plant; and that certain insects depended in main part on its nectar for food. i could give many facts, showing how anxious bees are to save time; for instance, their habit of cutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers, which they can, with a very little more trouble, enter by the mouth. bearing such facts in mind, i can see no reason to doubt that an accidental deviation in the size and form of the body, or in the curvature and length of the proboscis, etc., far too slight to be appreciated by us, might profit a bee or other insect, so that an individual so characterised would be able to obtain its food more quickly, and so have a better chance of living and leaving descendants. its descendants would probably inherit a tendency to a similar slight deviation of structure. the tubes of the corollas of the common red and incarnate clovers (trifolium pratense and incarnatum) do not on a hasty glance appear to differ in length; yet the hive-bee can easily suck the nectar out of the incarnate clover, but not out of the common red clover, which is visited by humble-bees alone; so that whole fields of the red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the hive-bee. thus it might be a great advantage to the hive-bee to have a slightly longer or differently constructed proboscis. on the other hand, i have found by experiment that the fertility of clover greatly depends on bees visiting and moving parts of the corolla, so as to push the pollen on to the stigmatic surface. hence, again, if humble-bees were to become rare in any country, it might be a great advantage to the red clover to have a shorter or more deeply divided tube to its corolla, so that the hive-bee could visit its flowers. thus i can understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other, by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure. i am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified in the above imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which were at first urged against sir charles lyell's noble views on "the modern changes of the earth, as illustrative of geology;" but we now very seldom hear the action, for instance, of the coast-waves, called a trifling and insignificant cause, when applied to the excavation of gigantic valleys or to the formation of the longest lines of inland cliffs. natural selection can act only by the preservation and accumulation of infinitesimally small inherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being; and as modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection, if it be a true principle, banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings, or of any great and sudden modification in their structure. on the intercrossing of individuals. i must here introduce a short digression. in the case of animals and plants with separated sexes, it is of course obvious that two individuals must always unite for each birth; but in the case of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious. nevertheless i am strongly inclined to believe that with all hermaphrodites two individuals, either occasionally or habitually, concur for the reproduction of their kind. this view, i may add, was first suggested by andrew knight. we shall presently see its importance; but i must here treat the subject with extreme brevity, though i have the materials prepared for an ample discussion. all vertebrate animals, all insects, and some other large groups of animals, pair for each birth. modern research has much diminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites, and of real hermaphrodites a large number pair; that is, two individuals regularly unite for reproduction, which is all that concerns us. but still there are many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair, and a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites. what reason, it may be asked, is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever concur in reproduction? as it is impossible here to enter on details, i must trust to some general considerations alone. in the first place, i have collected so large a body of facts, showing, in accordance with the almost universal belief of breeders, that with animals and plants a cross between different varieties, or between individuals of the same variety but of another strain, gives vigour and fertility to the offspring; and on the other hand, that close interbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility; that these facts alone incline me to believe that it is a general law of nature (utterly ignorant though we be of the meaning of the law) that no organic being self-fertilises itself for an eternity of generations; but that a cross with another individual is occasionally--perhaps at very long intervals--indispensable. on the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, i think, understand several large classes of facts, such as the following, which on any other view are inexplicable. every hybridizer knows how unfavourable exposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower, yet what a multitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to the weather! but if an occasional cross be indispensable, the fullest freedom for the entrance of pollen from another individual will explain this state of exposure, more especially as the plant's own anthers and pistil generally stand so close together that self-fertilisation seems almost inevitable. many flowers, on the other hand, have their organs of fructification closely enclosed, as in the great papilionaceous or pea-family; but in several, perhaps in all, such flowers, there is a very curious adaptation between the structure of the flower and the manner in which bees suck the nectar; for, in doing this, they either push the flower's own pollen on the stigma, or bring pollen from another flower. so necessary are the visits of bees to papilionaceous flowers, that i have found, by experiments published elsewhere, that their fertility is greatly diminished if these visits be prevented. now, it is scarcely possible that bees should fly from flower to flower, and not carry pollen from one to the other, to the great good, as i believe, of the plant. bees will act like a camel-hair pencil, and it is quite sufficient just to touch the anthers of one flower and then the stigma of another with the same brush to ensure fertilisation; but it must not be supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between distinct species; for if you bring on the same brush a plant's own pollen and pollen from another species, the former will have such a prepotent effect, that it will invariably and completely destroy, as has been shown by gartner, any influence from the foreign pollen. when the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil, or slowly move one after the other towards it, the contrivance seems adapted solely to ensure self-fertilisation; and no doubt it is useful for this end: but, the agency of insects is often required to cause the stamens to spring forward, as kolreuter has shown to be the case with the barberry; and curiously in this very genus, which seems to have a special contrivance for self-fertilisation, it is well known that if very closely-allied forms or varieties are planted near each other, it is hardly possible to raise pure seedlings, so largely do they naturally cross. in many other cases, far from there being any aids for self-fertilisation, there are special contrivances, as i could show from the writings of c. c. sprengel and from my own observations, which effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen from its own flower: for instance, in lobelia fulgens, there is a really beautiful and elaborate contrivance by which every one of the infinitely numerous pollen-granules are swept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower, before the stigma of that individual flower is ready to receive them; and as this flower is never visited, at least in my garden, by insects, it never sets a seed, though by placing pollen from one flower on the stigma of another, i raised plenty of seedlings; and whilst another species of lobelia growing close by, which is visited by bees, seeds freely. in very many other cases, though there be no special mechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma of a flower receiving its own pollen, yet, as c. c. sprengel has shown, and as i can confirm, either the anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation, or the stigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready, so that these plants have in fact separated sexes, and must habitually be crossed. how strange are these facts! how strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the same flower, though placed so close together, as if for the very purpose of self-fertilisation, should in so many cases be mutually useless to each other! how simply are these facts explained on the view of an occasional cross with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable! if several varieties of the cabbage, radish, onion, and of some other plants, be allowed to seed near each other, a large majority, as i have found, of the seedlings thus raised will turn out mongrels: for instance, i raised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of different varieties growing near each other, and of these only 78 were true to their kind, and some even of these were not perfectly true. yet the pistil of each cabbage-flower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens, but by those of the many other flowers on the same plant. how, then, comes it that such a vast number of the seedlings are mongrelized? i suspect that it must arise from the pollen of a distinct variety having a prepotent effect over a flower's own pollen; and that this is part of the general law of good being derived from the intercrossing of distinct individuals of the same species. when distinct species are crossed the case is directly the reverse, for a plant's own pollen is always prepotent over foreign pollen; but to this subject we shall return in a future chapter. in the case of a gigantic tree covered with innumerable flowers, it may be objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree, and at most only from flower to flower on the same tree, and that flowers on the same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a limited sense. i believe this objection to be valid, but that nature has largely provided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear flowers with separated sexes. when the sexes are separated, although the male and female flowers may be produced on the same tree, we can see that pollen must be regularly carried from flower to flower; and this will give a better chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree to tree. that trees belonging to all orders have their sexes more often separated than other plants, i find to be the case in this country; and at my request dr. hooker tabulated the trees of new zealand, and dr. asa gray those of the united states, and the result was as i anticipated. on the other hand, dr. hooker has recently informed me that he finds that the rule does not hold in australia; and i have made these few remarks on the sexes of trees simply to call attention to the subject. turning for a very brief space to animals: on the land there are some hermaphrodites, as land-mollusca and earth-worms; but these all pair. as yet i have not found a single case of a terrestrial animal which fertilises itself. we can understand this remarkable fact, which offers so strong a contrast with terrestrial plants, on the view of an occasional cross being indispensable, by considering the medium in which terrestrial animals live, and the nature of the fertilising element; for we know of no means, analogous to the action of insects and of the wind in the case of plants, by which an occasional cross could be effected with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two individuals. of aquatic animals, there are many self-fertilising hermaphrodites; but here currents in the water offer an obvious means for an occasional cross. and, as in the case of flowers, i have as yet failed, after consultation with one of the highest authorities, namely, professor huxley, to discover a single case of an hermaphrodite animal with the organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed within the body, that access from without and the occasional influence of a distinct individual can be shown to be physically impossible. cirripedes long appeared to me to present a case of very great difficulty under this point of view; but i have been enabled, by a fortunate chance, elsewhere to prove that two individuals, though both are self-fertilising hermaphrodites, do sometimes cross. it must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that, in the case of both animals and plants, species of the same family and even of the same genus, though agreeing closely with each other in almost their whole organisation, yet are not rarely, some of them hermaphrodites, and some of them unisexual. but if, in fact, all hermaphrodites do occasionally intercross with other individuals, the difference between hermaphrodites and unisexual species, as far as function is concerned, becomes very small. from these several considerations and from the many special facts which i have collected, but which i am not here able to give, i am strongly inclined to suspect that, both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, an occasional intercross with a distinct individual is a law of nature. i am well aware that there are, on this view, many cases of difficulty, some of which i am trying to investigate. finally then, we may conclude that in many organic beings, a cross between two individuals is an obvious necessity for each birth; in many others it occurs perhaps only at long intervals; but in none, as i suspect, can self-fertilisation go on for perpetuity. circumstances favourable to natural selection. this is an extremely intricate subject. a large amount of inheritable and diversified variability is favourable, but i believe mere individual differences suffice for the work. a large number of individuals, by giving a better chance for the appearance within any given period of profitable variations, will compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each individual, and is, i believe, an extremely important element of success. though nature grants vast periods of time for the work of natural selection, she does not grant an indefinite period; for as all organic beings are striving, it may be said, to seize on each place in the economy of nature, if any one species does not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree with its competitors, it will soon be exterminated. in man's methodical selection, a breeder selects for some definite object, and free intercrossing will wholly stop his work. but when many men, without intending to alter the breed, have a nearly common standard of perfection, and all try to get and breed from the best animals, much improvement and modification surely but slowly follow from this unconscious process of selection, notwithstanding a large amount of crossing with inferior animals. thus it will be in nature; for within a confined area, with some place in its polity not so perfectly occupied as might be, natural selection will always tend to preserve all the individuals varying in the right direction, though in different degrees, so as better to fill up the unoccupied place. but if the area be large, its several districts will almost certainly present different conditions of life; and then if natural selection be modifying and improving a species in the several districts, there will be intercrossing with the other individuals of the same species on the confines of each. and in this case the effects of intercrossing can hardly be counterbalanced by natural selection always tending to modify all the individuals in each district in exactly the same manner to the conditions of each; for in a continuous area, the conditions will generally graduate away insensibly from one district to another. the intercrossing will most affect those animals which unite for each birth, which wander much, and which do not breed at a very quick rate. hence in animals of this nature, for instance in birds, varieties will generally be confined to separated countries; and this i believe to be the case. in hermaphrodite organisms which cross only occasionally, and likewise in animals which unite for each birth, but which wander little and which can increase at a very rapid rate, a new and improved variety might be quickly formed on any one spot, and might there maintain itself in a body, so that whatever intercrossing took place would be chiefly between the individuals of the same new variety. a local variety when once thus formed might subsequently slowly spread to other districts. on the above principle, nurserymen always prefer getting seed from a large body of plants of the same variety, as the chance of intercrossing with other varieties is thus lessened. even in the case of slow-breeding animals, which unite for each birth, we must not overrate the effects of intercrosses in retarding natural selection; for i can bring a considerable catalogue of facts, showing that within the same area, varieties of the same animal can long remain distinct, from haunting different stations, from breeding at slightly different seasons, or from varieties of the same kind preferring to pair together. intercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping the individuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true and uniform in character. it will obviously thus act far more efficiently with those animals which unite for each birth; but i have already attempted to show that we have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses take place with all animals and with all plants. even if these take place only at long intervals, i am convinced that the young thus produced will gain so much in vigour and fertility over the offspring from long-continued self-fertilisation, that they will have a better chance of surviving and propagating their kind; and thus, in the long run, the influence of intercrosses, even at rare intervals, will be great. if there exist organic beings which never intercross, uniformity of character can be retained amongst them, as long as their conditions of life remain the same, only through the principle of inheritance, and through natural selection destroying any which depart from the proper type; but if their conditions of life change and they undergo modification, uniformity of character can be given to their modified offspring, solely by natural selection preserving the same favourable variations. isolation, also, is an important element in the process of natural selection. in a confined or isolated area, if not very large, the organic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be in a great degree uniform; so that natural selection will tend to modify all the individuals of a varying species throughout the area in the same manner in relation to the same conditions. intercrosses, also, with the individuals of the same species, which otherwise would have inhabited the surrounding and differently circumstanced districts, will be prevented. but isolation probably acts more efficiently in checking the immigration of better adapted organisms, after any physical change, such as of climate or elevation of the land, etc.; and thus new places in the natural economy of the country are left open for the old inhabitants to struggle for, and become adapted to, through modifications in their structure and constitution. lastly, isolation, by checking immigration and consequently competition, will give time for any new variety to be slowly improved; and this may sometimes be of importance in the production of new species. if, however, an isolated area be very small, either from being surrounded by barriers, or from having very peculiar physical conditions, the total number of the individuals supported on it will necessarily be very small; and fewness of individuals will greatly retard the production of new species through natural selection, by decreasing the chance of the appearance of favourable variations. if we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks, and look at any small isolated area, such as an oceanic island, although the total number of the species inhabiting it, will be found to be small, as we shall see in our chapter on geographical distribution; yet of these species a very large proportion are endemic,--that is, have been produced there, and nowhere else. hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have been highly favourable for the production of new species. but we may thus greatly deceive ourselves, for to ascertain whether a small isolated area, or a large open area like a continent, has been most favourable for the production of new organic forms, we ought to make the comparison within equal times; and this we are incapable of doing. although i do not doubt that isolation is of considerable importance in the production of new species, on the whole i am inclined to believe that largeness of area is of more importance, more especially in the production of species, which will prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading widely. throughout a great and open area, not only will there be a better chance of favourable variations arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are infinitely complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these many species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree or they will be exterminated. each new form, also, as soon as it has been much improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many others. hence more new places will be formed, and the competition to fill them will be more severe, on a large than on a small and isolated area. moreover, great areas, though now continuous, owing to oscillations of level, will often have recently existed in a broken condition, so that the good effects of isolation will generally, to a certain extent, have concurred. finally, i conclude that, although small isolated areas probably have been in some respects highly favourable for the production of new species, yet that the course of modification will generally have been more rapid on large areas; and what is more important, that the new forms produced on large areas, which already have been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, will give rise to most new varieties and species, and will thus play an important part in the changing history of the organic world. we can, perhaps, on these views, understand some facts which will be again alluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution; for instance, that the productions of the smaller continent of australia have formerly yielded, and apparently are now yielding, before those of the larger europaeo-asiatic area. thus, also, it is that continental productions have everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands. on a small island, the race for life will have been less severe, and there will have been less modification and less extermination. hence, perhaps, it comes that the flora of madeira, according to oswald heer, resembles the extinct tertiary flora of europe. all fresh-water basins, taken together, make a small area compared with that of the sea or of the land; and, consequently, the competition between fresh-water productions will have been less severe than elsewhere; new forms will have been more slowly formed, and old forms more slowly exterminated. and it is in fresh water that we find seven genera of ganoid fishes, remnants of a once preponderant order: and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now known in the world, as the ornithorhynchus and lepidosiren, which, like fossils, connect to a certain extent orders now widely separated in the natural scale. these anomalous forms may almost be called living fossils; they have endured to the present day, from having inhabited a confined area, and from having thus been exposed to less severe competition. to sum up the circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural selection, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits. i conclude, looking to the future, that for terrestrial productions a large continental area, which will probably undergo many oscillations of level, and which consequently will exist for long periods in a broken condition, will be the most favourable for the production of many new forms of life, likely to endure long and to spread widely. for the area will first have existed as a continent, and the inhabitants, at this period numerous in individuals and kinds, will have been subjected to very severe competition. when converted by subsidence into large separate islands, there will still exist many individuals of the same species on each island: intercrossing on the confines of the range of each species will thus be checked: after physical changes of any kind, immigration will be prevented, so that new places in the polity of each island will have to be filled up by modifications of the old inhabitants; and time will be allowed for the varieties in each to become well modified and perfected. when, by renewed elevation, the islands shall be re-converted into a continental area, there will again be severe competition: the most favoured or improved varieties will be enabled to spread: there will be much extinction of the less improved forms, and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the renewed continent will again be changed; and again there will be a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the inhabitants, and thus produce new species. that natural selection will always act with extreme slowness, i fully admit. its action depends on there being places in the polity of nature, which can be better occupied by some of the inhabitants of the country undergoing modification of some kind. the existence of such places will often depend on physical changes, which are generally very slow, and on the immigration of better adapted forms having been checked. but the action of natural selection will probably still oftener depend on some of the inhabitants becoming slowly modified; the mutual relations of many of the other inhabitants being thus disturbed. nothing can be effected, unless favourable variations occur, and variation itself is apparently always a very slow process. the process will often be greatly retarded by free intercrossing. many will exclaim that these several causes are amply sufficient wholly to stop the action of natural selection. i do not believe so. on the other hand, i do believe that natural selection will always act very slowly, often only at long intervals of time, and generally on only a very few of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time. i further believe, that this very slow, intermittent action of natural selection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of this world have changed. slow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection, i can see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection. extinction. this subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on geology; but it must be here alluded to from being intimately connected with natural selection. natural selection acts solely through the preservation of variations in some way advantageous, which consequently endure. but as from the high geometrical powers of increase of all organic beings, each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, it follows that as each selected and favoured form increases in number, so will the less favoured forms decrease and become rare. rarity, as geology tells us, is the precursor to extinction. we can, also, see that any form represented by few individuals will, during fluctuations in the seasons or in the number of its enemies, run a good chance of utter extinction. but we may go further than this; for as new forms are continually and slowly being produced, unless we believe that the number of specific forms goes on perpetually and almost indefinitely increasing, numbers inevitably must become extinct. that the number of specific forms has not indefinitely increased, geology shows us plainly; and indeed we can see reason why they should not have thus increased, for the number of places in the polity of nature is not indefinitely great,--not that we have any means of knowing that any one region has as yet got its maximum of species. probably no region is as yet fully stocked, for at the cape of good hope, where more species of plants are crowded together than in any other quarter of the world, some foreign plants have become naturalised, without causing, as far as we know, the extinction of any natives. furthermore, the species which are most numerous in individuals will have the best chance of producing within any given period favourable variations. we have evidence of this, in the facts given in the second chapter, showing that it is the common species which afford the greatest number of recorded varieties, or incipient species. hence, rare species will be less quickly modified or improved within any given period, and they will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the modified descendants of the commoner species. from these several considerations i think it inevitably follows, that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural selection, others will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct. the forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing modification and improvement, will naturally suffer most. and we have seen in the chapter on the struggle for existence that it is the most closely-allied forms,--varieties of the same species, and species of the same genus or of related genera,--which, from having nearly the same structure, constitution, and habits, generally come into the severest competition with each other. consequently, each new variety or species, during the progress of its formation, will generally press hardest on its nearest kindred, and tend to exterminate them. we see the same process of extermination amongst our domesticated productions, through the selection of improved forms by man. many curious instances could be given showing how quickly new breeds of cattle, sheep, and other animals, and varieties of flowers, take the place of older and inferior kinds. in yorkshire, it is historically known that the ancient black cattle were displaced by the long-horns, and that these "were swept away by the short-horns" (i quote the words of an agricultural writer) "as if by some murderous pestilence." divergence of character. the principle, which i have designated by this term, is of high importance on my theory, and explains, as i believe, several important facts. in the first place, varieties, even strongly-marked ones, though having somewhat of the character of species--as is shown by the hopeless doubts in many cases how to rank them--yet certainly differ from each other far less than do good and distinct species. nevertheless, according to my view, varieties are species in the process of formation, or are, as i have called them, incipient species. how, then, does the lesser difference between varieties become augmented into the greater difference between species? that this does habitually happen, we must infer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presenting well-marked differences; whereas varieties, the supposed prototypes and parents of future well-marked species, present slight and ill-defined differences. mere chance, as we may call it, might cause one variety to differ in some character from its parents, and the offspring of this variety again to differ from its parent in the very same character and in a greater degree; but this alone would never account for so habitual and large an amount of difference as that between varieties of the same species and species of the same genus. as has always been my practice, let us seek light on this head from our domestic productions. we shall here find something analogous. a fancier is struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak; another fancier is struck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak; and on the acknowledged principle that "fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard, but like extremes," they both go on (as has actually occurred with tumbler-pigeons) choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer beaks, or with shorter and shorter beaks. again, we may suppose that at an early period one man preferred swifter horses; another stronger and more bulky horses. the early differences would be very slight; in the course of time, from the continued selection of swifter horses by some breeders, and of stronger ones by others, the differences would become greater, and would be noted as forming two sub-breeds; finally, after the lapse of centuries, the sub-breeds would become converted into two well-established and distinct breeds. as the differences slowly become greater, the inferior animals with intermediate characters, being neither very swift nor very strong, will have been neglected, and will have tended to disappear. here, then, we see in man's productions the action of what may be called the principle of divergence, causing differences, at first barely appreciable, steadily to increase, and the breeds to diverge in character both from each other and from their common parent. but how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature? i believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers. we can clearly see this in the case of animals with simple habits. take the case of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the number that can be supported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average. if its natural powers of increase be allowed to act, it can succeed in increasing (the country not undergoing any change in its conditions) only by its varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied by other animals: some of them, for instance, being enabled to feed on new kinds of prey, either dead or alive; some inhabiting new stations, climbing trees, frequenting water, and some perhaps becoming less carnivorous. the more diversified in habits and structure the descendants of our carnivorous animal became, the more places they would be enabled to occupy. what applies to one animal will apply throughout all time to all animals--that is, if they vary--for otherwise natural selection can do nothing. so it will be with plants. it has been experimentally proved, that if a plot of ground be sown with one species of grass, and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera of grasses, a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage can thus be raised. the same has been found to hold good when first one variety and then several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown on equal spaces of ground. hence, if any one species of grass were to go on varying, and those varieties were continually selected which differed from each other in at all the same manner as distinct species and genera of grasses differ from each other, a greater number of individual plants of this species of grass, including its modified descendants, would succeed in living on the same piece of ground. and we well know that each species and each variety of grass is annually sowing almost countless seeds; and thus, as it may be said, is striving its utmost to increase its numbers. consequently, i cannot doubt that in the course of many thousands of generations, the most distinct varieties of any one species of grass would always have the best chance of succeeding and of increasing in numbers, and thus of supplanting the less distinct varieties; and varieties, when rendered very distinct from each other, take the rank of species. the truth of the principle, that the greatest amount of life can be supported by great diversification of structure, is seen under many natural circumstances. in an extremely small area, especially if freely open to immigration, and where the contest between individual and individual must be severe, we always find great diversity in its inhabitants. for instance, i found that a piece of turf, three feet by four in size, which had been exposed for many years to exactly the same conditions, supported twenty species of plants, and these belonged to eighteen genera and to eight orders, which shows how much these plants differed from each other. so it is with the plants and insects on small and uniform islets; and so in small ponds of fresh water. farmers find that they can raise most food by a rotation of plants belonging to the most different orders: nature follows what may be called a simultaneous rotation. most of the animals and plants which live close round any small piece of ground, could live on it (supposing it not to be in any way peculiar in its nature), and may be said to be striving to the utmost to live there; but, it is seen, that where they come into the closest competition with each other, the advantages of diversification of structure, with the accompanying differences of habit and constitution, determine that the inhabitants, which thus jostle each other most closely, shall, as a general rule, belong to what we call different genera and orders. the same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants through man's agency in foreign lands. it might have been expected that the plants which have succeeded in becoming naturalised in any land would generally have been closely allied to the indigenes; for these are commonly looked at as specially created and adapted for their own country. it might, also, perhaps have been expected that naturalised plants would have belonged to a few groups more especially adapted to certain stations in their new homes. but the case is very different; and alph. de candolle has well remarked in his great and admirable work, that floras gain by naturalisation, proportionally with the number of the native genera and species, far more in new genera than in new species. to give a single instance: in the last edition of dr. asa gray's 'manual of the flora of the northern united states,' 260 naturalised plants are enumerated, and these belong to 162 genera. we thus see that these naturalised plants are of a highly diversified nature. they differ, moreover, to a large extent from the indigenes, for out of the 162 genera, no less than 100 genera are not there indigenous, and thus a large proportional addition is made to the genera of these states. by considering the nature of the plants or animals which have struggled successfully with the indigenes of any country, and have there become naturalised, we can gain some crude idea in what manner some of the natives would have had to be modified, in order to have gained an advantage over the other natives; and we may, i think, at least safely infer that diversification of structure, amounting to new generic differences, would have been profitable to them. the advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same region is, in fact, the same as that of the physiological division of labour in the organs of the same individual body--a subject so well elucidated by milne edwards. no physiologist doubts that a stomach by being adapted to digest vegetable matter alone, or flesh alone, draws most nutriment from these substances. so in the general economy of any land, the more widely and perfectly the animals and plants are diversified for different habits of life, so will a greater number of individuals be capable of there supporting themselves. a set of animals, with their organisation but little diversified, could hardly compete with a set more perfectly diversified in structure. it may be doubted, for instance, whether the australian marsupials, which are divided into groups differing but little from each other, and feebly representing, as mr. waterhouse and others have remarked, our carnivorous, ruminant, and rodent mammals, could successfully compete with these well-pronounced orders. in the australian mammals, we see the process of diversification in an early and incomplete stage of development. after the foregoing discussion, which ought to have been much amplified, we may, i think, assume that the modified descendants of any one species will succeed by so much the better as they become more diversified in structure, and are thus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings. now let us see how this principle of great benefit being derived from divergence of character, combined with the principles of natural selection and of extinction, will tend to act. the accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather perplexing subject. let a to l represent the species of a genus large in its own country; these species are supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally the case in nature, and as is represented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances. i have said a large genus, because we have seen in the second chapter, that on an average more of the species of large genera vary than of small genera; and the varying species of the large genera present a greater number of varieties. we have, also, seen that the species, which are the commonest and the most widely-diffused, vary more than rare species with restricted ranges. let (a) be a common, widely-diffused, and varying species, belonging to a genus large in its own country. the little fan of diverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from (a), may represent its varying offspring. the variations are supposed to be extremely slight, but of the most diversified nature; they are not supposed all to appear simultaneously, but often after long intervals of time; nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods. only those variations which are in some way profitable will be preserved or naturally selected. and here the importance of the principle of benefit being derived from divergence of character comes in; for this will generally lead to the most different or divergent variations (represented by the outer dotted lines) being preserved and accumulated by natural selection. when a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal lines, and is there marked by a small numbered letter, a sufficient amount of variation is supposed to have been accumulated to have formed a fairly well-marked variety, such as would be thought worthy of record in a systematic work. the intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram, may represent each a thousand generations; but it would have been better if each had represented ten thousand generations. after a thousand generations, species (a) is supposed to have produced two fairly well-marked varieties, namely a1 and m1. these two varieties will generally continue to be exposed to the same conditions which made their parents variable, and the tendency to variability is in itself hereditary, consequently they will tend to vary, and generally to vary in nearly the same manner as their parents varied. moreover, these two varieties, being only slightly modified forms, will tend to inherit those advantages which made their common parent (a) more numerous than most of the other inhabitants of the same country; they will likewise partake of those more general advantages which made the genus to which the parent-species belonged, a large genus in its own country. and these circumstances we know to be favourable to the production of new varieties. if, then, these two varieties be variable, the most divergent of their variations will generally be preserved during the next thousand generations. and after this interval, variety a1 is supposed in the diagram to have produced variety a2, which will, owing to the principle of divergence, differ more from (a) than did variety a1. variety m1 is supposed to have produced two varieties, namely m2 and s2, differing from each other, and more considerably from their common parent (a). we may continue the process by similar steps for any length of time; some of the varieties, after each thousand generations, producing only a single variety, but in a more and more modified condition, some producing two or three varieties, and some failing to produce any. thus the varieties or modified descendants, proceeding from the common parent (a), will generally go on increasing in number and diverging in character. in the diagram the process is represented up to the ten-thousandth generation, and under a condensed and simplified form up to the fourteen-thousandth generation. but i must here remark that i do not suppose that the process ever goes on so regularly as is represented in the diagram, though in itself made somewhat irregular. i am far from thinking that the most divergent varieties will invariably prevail and multiply: a medium form may often long endure, and may or may not produce more than one modified descendant; for natural selection will always act according to the nature of the places which are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other beings; and this will depend on infinitely complex relations. but as a general rule, the more diversified in structure the descendants from any one species can be rendered, the more places they will be enabled to seize on, and the more their modified progeny will be increased. in our diagram the line of succession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered letters marking the successive forms which have become sufficiently distinct to be recorded as varieties. but these breaks are imaginary, and might have been inserted anywhere, after intervals long enough to have allowed the accumulation of a considerable amount of divergent variation. as all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused species, belonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the same advantages which made their parent successful in life, they will generally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in character: this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent branches proceeding from (a). the modified offspring from the later and more highly improved branches in the lines of descent, will, it is probable, often take the place of, and so destroy, the earlier and less improved branches: this is represented in the diagram by some of the lower branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines. in some cases i do not doubt that the process of modification will be confined to a single line of descent, and the number of the descendants will not be increased; although the amount of divergent modification may have been increased in the successive generations. this case would be represented in the diagram, if all the lines proceeding from (a) were removed, excepting that from a1 to a10. in the same way, for instance, the english race-horse and english pointer have apparently both gone on slowly diverging in character from their original stocks, without either having given off any fresh branches or races. after ten thousand generations, species (a) is supposed to have produced three forms, a10, f10, and m10, which, from having diverged in character during the successive generations, will have come to differ largely, but perhaps unequally, from each other and from their common parent. if we suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our diagram to be excessively small, these three forms may still be only well-marked varieties; or they may have arrived at the doubtful category of sub-species; but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of modification to be more numerous or greater in amount, to convert these three forms into well-defined species: thus the diagram illustrates the steps by which the small differences distinguishing varieties are increased into the larger differences distinguishing species. by continuing the same process for a greater number of generations (as shown in the diagram in a condensed and simplified manner), we get eight species, marked by the letters between a14 and m14, all descended from (a). thus, as i believe, species are multiplied and genera are formed. in a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary. in the diagram i have assumed that a second species (i) has produced, by analogous steps, after ten thousand generations, either two well-marked varieties (w10 and z10) or two species, according to the amount of change supposed to be represented between the horizontal lines. after fourteen thousand generations, six new species, marked by the letters n14 to z14, are supposed to have been produced. in each genus, the species, which are already extremely different in character, will generally tend to produce the greatest number of modified descendants; for these will have the best chance of filling new and widely different places in the polity of nature: hence in the diagram i have chosen the extreme species (a), and the nearly extreme species (i), as those which have largely varied, and have given rise to new varieties and species. the other nine species (marked by capital letters) of our original genus, may for a long period continue transmitting unaltered descendants; and this is shown in the diagram by the dotted lines not prolonged far upwards from want of space. but during the process of modification, represented in the diagram, another of our principles, namely that of extinction, will have played an important part. as in each fully stocked country natural selection necessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the struggle for life over other forms, there will be a constant tendency in the improved descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminate in each stage of descent their predecessors and their original parent. for it should be remembered that the competition will generally be most severe between those forms which are most nearly related to each other in habits, constitution, and structure. hence all the intermediate forms between the earlier and later states, that is between the less and more improved state of a species, as well as the original parent-species itself, will generally tend to become extinct. so it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of descent, which will be conquered by later and improved lines of descent. if, however, the modified offspring of a species get into some distinct country, or become quickly adapted to some quite new station, in which child and parent do not come into competition, both may continue to exist. if then our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount of modification, species (a) and all the earlier varieties will have become extinct, having been replaced by eight new species (a14 to m14); and (i) will have been replaced by six (n14 to z14) new species. but we may go further than this. the original species of our genus were supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally the case in nature; species (a) being more nearly related to b, c, and d, than to the other species; and species (i) more to g, h, k, l, than to the others. these two species (a) and (i), were also supposed to be very common and widely diffused species, so that they must originally have had some advantage over most of the other species of the genus. their modified descendants, fourteen in number at the fourteen-thousandth generation, will probably have inherited some of the same advantages: they have also been modified and improved in a diversified manner at each stage of descent, so as to have become adapted to many related places in the natural economy of their country. it seems, therefore, to me extremely probable that they will have taken the places of, and thus exterminated, not only their parents (a) and (i), but likewise some of the original species which were most nearly related to their parents. hence very few of the original species will have transmitted offspring to the fourteen-thousandth generation. we may suppose that only one (f), of the two species which were least closely related to the other nine original species, has transmitted descendants to this late stage of descent. the new species in our diagram descended from the original eleven species, will now be fifteen in number. owing to the divergent tendency of natural selection, the extreme amount of difference in character between species a14 and z14 will be much greater than that between the most different of the original eleven species. the new species, moreover, will be allied to each other in a widely different manner. of the eight descendants from (a) the three marked a14, q14, p14, will be nearly related from having recently branched off from a10; b14 and f14, from having diverged at an earlier period from a5, will be in some degree distinct from the three first-named species; and lastly, o14, e14, and m14, will be nearly related one to the other, but from having diverged at the first commencement of the process of modification, will be widely different from the other five species, and may constitute a sub-genus or even a distinct genus. the six descendants from (i) will form two sub-genera or even genera. but as the original species (i) differed largely from (a), standing nearly at the extreme points of the original genus, the six descendants from (i) will, owing to inheritance, differ considerably from the eight descendants from (a); the two groups, moreover, are supposed to have gone on diverging in different directions. the intermediate species, also (and this is a very important consideration), which connected the original species (a) and (i), have all become, excepting (f), extinct, and have left no descendants. hence the six new species descended from (i), and the eight descended from (a), will have to be ranked as very distinct genera, or even as distinct sub-families. thus it is, as i believe, that two or more genera are produced by descent, with modification, from two or more species of the same genus. and the two or more parent-species are supposed to have descended from some one species of an earlier genus. in our diagram, this is indicated by the broken lines, beneath the capital letters, converging in sub-branches downwards towards a single point; this point representing a single species, the supposed single parent of our several new sub-genera and genera. it is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new species f14, which is supposed not to have diverged much in character, but to have retained the form of (f), either unaltered or altered only in a slight degree. in this case, its affinities to the other fourteen new species will be of a curious and circuitous nature. having descended from a form which stood between the two parent-species (a) and (i), now supposed to be extinct and unknown, it will be in some degree intermediate in character between the two groups descended from these species. but as these two groups have gone on diverging in character from the type of their parents, the new species (f14) will not be directly intermediate between them, but rather between types of the two groups; and every naturalist will be able to bring some such case before his mind. in the diagram, each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to represent a thousand generations, but each may represent a million or hundred million generations, and likewise a section of the successive strata of the earth's crust including extinct remains. we shall, when we come to our chapter on geology, have to refer again to this subject, and i think we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the affinities of extinct beings, which, though generally belonging to the same orders, or families, or genera, with those now living, yet are often, in some degree, intermediate in character between existing groups; and we can understand this fact, for the extinct species lived at very ancient epochs when the branching lines of descent had diverged less. i see no reason to limit the process of modification, as now explained, to the formation of genera alone. if, in our diagram, we suppose the amount of change represented by each successive group of diverging dotted lines to be very great, the forms marked a14 to p14, those marked b14 and f14, and those marked o14 to m14, will form three very distinct genera. we shall also have two very distinct genera descended from (i) and as these latter two genera, both from continued divergence of character and from inheritance from a different parent, will differ widely from the three genera descended from (a), the two little groups of genera will form two distinct families, or even orders, according to the amount of divergent modification supposed to be represented in the diagram. and the two new families, or orders, will have descended from two species of the original genus; and these two species are supposed to have descended from one species of a still more ancient and unknown genus. we have seen that in each country it is the species of the larger genera which oftenest present varieties or incipient species. this, indeed, might have been expected; for as natural selection acts through one form having some advantage over other forms in the struggle for existence, it will chiefly act on those which already have some advantage; and the largeness of any group shows that its species have inherited from a common ancestor some advantage in common. hence, the struggle for the production of new and modified descendants, will mainly lie between the larger groups, which are all trying to increase in number. one large group will slowly conquer another large group, reduce its numbers, and thus lessen its chance of further variation and improvement. within the same large group, the later and more highly perfected sub-groups, from branching out and seizing on many new places in the polity of nature, will constantly tend to supplant and destroy the earlier and less improved sub-groups. small and broken groups and sub-groups will finally tend to disappear. looking to the future, we can predict that the groups of organic beings which are now large and triumphant, and which are least broken up, that is, which as yet have suffered least extinction, will for a long period continue to increase. but which groups will ultimately prevail, no man can predict; for we well know that many groups, formerly most extensively developed, have now become extinct. looking still more remotely to the future, we may predict that, owing to the continued and steady increase of the larger groups, a multitude of smaller groups will become utterly extinct, and leave no modified descendants; and consequently that of the species living at any one period, extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote futurity. i shall have to return to this subject in the chapter on classification, but i may add that on this view of extremely few of the more ancient species having transmitted descendants, and on the view of all the descendants of the same species making a class, we can understand how it is that there exist but very few classes in each main division of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. although extremely few of the most ancient species may now have living and modified descendants, yet at the most remote geological period, the earth may have been as well peopled with many species of many genera, families, orders, and classes, as at the present day. summary of chapter. if during the long course of ages and under varying conditions of life, organic beings vary at all in the several parts of their organisation, and i think this cannot be disputed; if there be, owing to the high geometrical powers of increase of each species, at some age, season, or year, a severe struggle for life, and this certainly cannot be disputed; then, considering the infinite complexity of the relations of all organic beings to each other and to their conditions of existence, causing an infinite diversity in structure, constitution, and habits, to be advantageous to them, i think it would be a most extraordinary fact if no variation ever had occurred useful to each being's own welfare, in the same way as so many variations have occurred useful to man. but if variations useful to any organic being do occur, assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly characterised. this principle of preservation, i have called, for the sake of brevity, natural selection. natural selection, on the principle of qualities being inherited at corresponding ages, can modify the egg, seed, or young, as easily as the adult. amongst many animals, sexual selection will give its aid to ordinary selection, by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted males the greatest number of offspring. sexual selection will also give characters useful to the males alone, in their struggles with other males. whether natural selection has really thus acted in nature, in modifying and adapting the various forms of life to their several conditions and stations, must be judged of by the general tenour and balance of evidence given in the following chapters. but we already see how it entails extinction; and how largely extinction has acted in the world's history, geology plainly declares. natural selection, also, leads to divergence of character; for more living beings can be supported on the same area the more they diverge in structure, habits, and constitution, of which we see proof by looking at the inhabitants of any small spot or at naturalised productions. therefore during the modification of the descendants of any one species, and during the incessant struggle of all species to increase in numbers, the more diversified these descendants become, the better will be their chance of succeeding in the battle of life. thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species, will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater differences between species of the same genus, or even of distinct genera. we have seen that it is the common, the widely-diffused, and widely-ranging species, belonging to the larger genera, which vary most; and these will tend to transmit to their modified offspring that superiority which now makes them dominant in their own countries. natural selection, as has just been remarked, leads to divergence of character and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate forms of life. on these principles, i believe, the nature of the affinities of all organic beings may be explained. it is a truly wonderful fact--the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity--that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group, in the manner which we everywhere behold--namely, varieties of the same species most closely related together, species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together, forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct genera much less closely related, and genera related in different degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and classes. the several subordinate groups in any class cannot be ranked in a single file, but seem rather to be clustered round points, and these round other points, and so on in almost endless cycles. on the view that each species has been independently created, i can see no explanation of this great fact in the classification of all organic beings; but, to the best of my judgment, it is explained through inheritance and the complex action of natural selection, entailing extinction and divergence of character, as we have seen illustrated in the diagram. the affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. i believe this simile largely speaks the truth. the green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and those produced during each former year may represent the long succession of extinct species. at each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and groups of species have tried to overmaster other species in the great battle for life. the limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small, budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups. of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two or three, now grown into great branches, yet survive and bear all the other branches; so with the species which lived during long-past geological periods, very few now have living and modified descendants. from the first growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off; and these lost branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders, families, and genera which have now no living representatives, and which are known to us only from having been found in a fossil state. as we here and there see a thin straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree, and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the ornithorhynchus or lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by its affinities two large branches of life, and which has apparently been saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a protected station. as buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation i believe it has been with the great tree of life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications. 5. laws of variation. effects of

beings under domestication, and in a lesser degree in those in a state of nature--had been due to chance. this, of course, is a wholly incorrect expression, but it serves to acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation. some authors believe it to be as much the function of the reproductive system to produce individual differences, or very slight deviations of structure, as to make the child like its parents. but the much greater variability, as well as the greater frequency of monstrosities, under domestication or cultivation, than under nature, leads me to believe that deviations of structure are in some way due to the nature of the conditions of life, to which the parents and their more remote ancestors have been exposed during several generations. i have remarked in the first chapter--but a long catalogue of facts which cannot be here given would be necessary to show the truth of the remark--that the reproductive system is eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life; and to this system being functionally disturbed in the parents, i chiefly attribute the varying or plastic condition of the offspring. the male and female sexual elements seem to be affected before that union takes place which is to form a new being. in the case of "sporting" plants, the bud, which in its earliest condition does not apparently differ essentially from an ovule, is alone affected. but why, because the reproductive system is disturbed, this or that part should vary more or less, we are profoundly ignorant. nevertheless, we can here and there dimly catch a faint ray of light, and we may feel sure that there must be some cause for each deviation of structure, however slight. how much direct effect difference of climate, food, etc., produces on any being is extremely doubtful. my impression is, that the effect is extremely small in the case of animals, but perhaps rather more in that of plants. we may, at least, safely conclude that such influences cannot have produced the many striking and complex co-adaptations of structure between one organic being and another, which we see everywhere throughout nature. some little influence may be attributed to climate, food, etc.: thus, e. forbes speaks confidently that shells at their southern limit, and when living in shallow water, are more brightly coloured than those of the same species further north or from greater depths. gould believes that birds of the same species are more brightly coloured under a clear atmosphere, than when living on islands or near the coast. so with insects, wollaston is convinced that residence near the sea affects their colours. moquin-tandon gives a list of plants which when growing near the sea-shore have their leaves in some degree fleshy, though not elsewhere fleshy. several other such cases could be given. the fact of varieties of one species, when they range into the zone of habitation of other species, often acquiring in a very slight degree some of the characters of such species, accords with our view that species of all kinds are only well-marked and permanent varieties. thus the species of shells which are confined to tropical and shallow seas are generally brighter-coloured than those confined to cold and deeper seas. the birds which are confined to continents are, according to mr. gould, brighter-coloured than those of islands. the insect-species confined to sea-coasts, as every collector knows, are often brassy or lurid. plants which live exclusively on the sea-side are very apt to have fleshy leaves. he who believes in the creation of each species, will have to say that this shell, for instance, was created with bright colours for a warm sea; but that this other shell became bright-coloured by variation when it ranged into warmer or shallower waters. when a variation is of the slightest use to a being, we cannot tell how much of it to attribute to the accumulative action of natural selection, and how much to the conditions of life. thus, it is well known to furriers that animals of the same species have thicker and better fur the more severe the climate is under which they have lived; but who can tell how much of this difference may be due to the warmest-clad individuals having been favoured and preserved during many generations, and how much to the direct action of the severe climate? for it would appear that climate has some direct action on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds. instances could be given of the same variety being produced under conditions of life as different as can well be conceived; and, on the other hand, of different varieties being produced from the same species under the same conditions. such facts show how indirectly the conditions of life must act. again, innumerable instances are known to every naturalist of species keeping true, or not varying at all, although living under the most opposite climates. such considerations as these incline me to lay very little weight on the direct action of the conditions of life. indirectly, as already remarked, they seem to play an important part in affecting the reproductive system, and in thus inducing variability; and natural selection will then accumulate all profitable variations, however slight, until they become plainly developed and appreciable by us. effects of use and disuse. from the facts alluded to in the first chapter, i think there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited. under free nature, we can have no standard of comparison, by which to judge of the effects of long-continued use or disuse, for we know not the parent-forms; but many animals have structures which can be explained by the effects of disuse. as professor owen has remarked, there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot fly; yet there are several in this state. the logger-headed duck of south america can only flap along the surface of the water, and has its wings in nearly the same condition as the domestic aylesbury duck. as the larger ground-feeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger, i believe that the nearly wingless condition of several birds, which now inhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by no beast of prey, has been caused by disuse. the ostrich indeed inhabits continents and is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by flight, but by kicking it can defend itself from enemies, as well as any of the smaller quadrupeds. we may imagine that the early progenitor of the ostrich had habits like those of a bustard, and that as natural selection increased in successive generations the size and weight of its body, its legs were used more, and its wings less, until they became incapable of flight. kirby has remarked (and i have observed the same fact) that the anterior tarsi, or feet, of many male dung-feeding beetles are very often broken off; he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection, and not one had even a relic left. in the onites apelles the tarsi are so habitually lost, that the insect has been described as not having them. in some other genera they are present, but in a rudimentary condition. in the ateuchus or sacred beetle of the egyptians, they are totally deficient. there is not sufficient evidence to induce us to believe that mutilations are ever inherited; and i should prefer explaining the entire absence of the anterior tarsi in ateuchus, and their rudimentary condition in some other genera, by the long-continued effects of disuse in their progenitors; for as the tarsi are almost always lost in many dung-feeding beetles, they must be lost early in life, and therefore cannot be much used by these insects. in some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of structure which are wholly, or mainly, due to natural selection. mr. wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out of the 550 species inhabiting madeira, are so far deficient in wings that they cannot fly; and that of the twenty-nine endemic genera, no less than twenty-three genera have all their species in this condition! several facts, namely, that beetles in many parts of the world are very frequently blown to sea and perish; that the beetles in madeira, as observed by mr. wollaston, lie much concealed, until the wind lulls and the sun shines; that the proportion of wingless beetles is larger on the exposed dezertas than in madeira itself; and especially the extraordinary fact, so strongly insisted on by mr. wollaston, of the almost entire absence of certain large groups of beetles, elsewhere excessively numerous, and which groups have habits of life almost necessitating frequent flight;--these several considerations have made me believe that the wingless condition of so many madeira beetles is mainly due to the action of natural selection, but combined probably with disuse. for during thousands of successive generations each individual beetle which flew least, either from its wings having been ever so little less perfectly developed or from indolent habit, will have had the best chance of surviving from not being blown out to sea; and, on the other hand, those beetles which most readily took to flight will oftenest have been blown to sea and thus have been destroyed. the insects in madeira which are not ground-feeders, and which, as the flower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, must habitually use their wings to gain their subsistence, have, as mr. wollaston suspects, their wings not at all reduced, but even enlarged. this is quite compatible with the action of natural selection. for when a new insect first arrived on the island, the tendency of natural selection to enlarge or to reduce the wings, would depend on whether a greater number of individuals were saved by successfully battling with the winds, or by giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying. as with mariners shipwrecked near a coast, it would have been better for the good swimmers if they had been able to swim still further, whereas it would have been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able to swim at all and had stuck to the wreck. the eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size, and in some cases are quite covered up by skin and fur. this state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided perhaps by natural selection. in south america, a burrowing rodent, the tuco-tuco, or ctenomys, is even more subterranean in its habits than the mole; and i was assured by a spaniard, who had often caught them, that they were frequently blind; one which i kept alive was certainly in this condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been inflammation of the nictitating membrane. as frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not indispensable to animals with subterranean habits, a reduction in their size with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them, might in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would constantly aid the effects of disuse. it is well known that several animals, belonging to the most different classes, which inhabit the caves of styria and of kentucky, are blind. in some of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains, though the eye is gone; the stand for the telescope is there, though the telescope with its glasses has been lost. as it is difficult to imagine that eyes, though useless, could be in any way injurious to animals living in darkness, i attribute their loss wholly to disuse. in one of the blind animals, namely, the cave-rat, the eyes are of immense size; and professor silliman thought that it regained, after living some days in the light, some slight power of vision. in the same manner as in madeira the wings of some of the insects have been enlarged, and the wings of others have been reduced by natural selection aided by use and disuse, so in the case of the cave-rat natural selection seems to have struggled with the loss of light and to have increased the size of the eyes; whereas with all the other inhabitants of the caves, disuse by itself seems to have done its work. it is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep limestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that on the common view of the blind animals having been separately created for the american and european caverns, close similarity in their organisation and affinities might have been expected; but, as schiodte and others have remarked, this is not the case, and the cave-insects of the two continents are not more closely allied than might have been anticipated from the general resemblance of the other inhabitants of north america and europe. on my view we must suppose that american animals, having ordinary powers of vision, slowly migrated by successive generations from the outer world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the kentucky caves, as did european animals into the caves of europe. we have some evidence of this gradation of habit; for, as schiodte remarks, "animals not far remote from ordinary forms, prepare the transition from light to darkness. next follow those that are constructed for twilight; and, last of all, those destined for total darkness." by the time that an animal had reached, after numberless generations, the deepest recesses, disuse will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and natural selection will often have effected other changes, such as an increase in the length of the antennae or palpi, as a compensation for blindness. notwithstanding such modifications, we might expect still to see in the cave-animals of america, affinities to the other inhabitants of that continent, and in those of europe, to the inhabitants of the european continent. and this is the case with some of the american cave-animals, as i hear from professor dana; and some of the european cave-insects are very closely allied to those of the surrounding country. it would be most difficult to give any rational explanation of the affinities of the blind cave-animals to the other inhabitants of the two continents on the ordinary view of their independent creation. that several of the inhabitants of the caves of the old and new worlds should be closely related, we might expect from the well-known relationship of most of their other productions. far from feeling any surprise that some of the cave-animals should be very anomalous, as agassiz has remarked in regard to the blind fish, the amblyopsis, and as is the case with the blind proteus with reference to the reptiles of europe, i am only surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved, owing to the less severe competition to which the inhabitants of these dark abodes will probably have been exposed. acclimatisation. habit is hereditary with plants, as in the period of flowering, in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate, in the time of sleep, etc., and this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation. as it is extremely common for species of the same genus to inhabit very hot and very cold countries, and as i believe that all the species of the same genus have descended from a single parent, if this view be correct, acclimatisation must be readily effected during long-continued descent. it is notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its own home: species from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot endure a tropical climate, or conversely. so again, many succulent plants cannot endure a damp climate. but the degree of adaptation of species to the climates under which they live is often overrated. we may infer this from our frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported plant will endure our climate, and from the number of plants and animals brought from warmer countries which here enjoy good health. we have reason to believe that species in a state of nature are limited in their ranges by the competition of other organic beings quite as much as, or more than, by adaptation to particular climates. but whether or not the adaptation be generally very close, we have evidence, in the case of some few plants, of their becoming, to a certain extent, naturally habituated to different temperatures, or becoming acclimatised: thus the pines and rhododendrons, raised from seed collected by dr. hooker from trees growing at different heights on the himalaya, were found in this country to possess different constitutional powers of resisting cold. mr. thwaites informs me that he has observed similar facts in ceylon, and analogous observations have been made by mr. h. c. watson on european species of plants brought from the azores to england. in regard to animals, several authentic cases could be given of species within historical times having largely extended their range from warmer to cooler latitudes, and conversely; but we do not positively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native climate, but in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case; nor do we know that they have subsequently become acclimatised to their new homes. as i believe that our domestic animals were originally chosen by uncivilised man because they were useful and bred readily under confinement, and not because they were subsequently found capable of far-extended transportation, i think the common and extraordinary capacity in our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different climates but of being perfectly fertile (a far severer test) under them, may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other animals, now in a state of nature, could easily be brought to bear widely different climates. we must not, however, push the foregoing argument too far, on account of the probable origin of some of our domestic animals from several wild stocks: the blood, for instance, of a tropical and arctic wolf or wild dog may perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds. the rat and mouse cannot be considered as domestic animals, but they have been transported by man to many parts of the world, and now have a far wider range than any other rodent, living free under the cold climate of faroe in the north and of the falklands in the south, and on many islands in the torrid zones. hence i am inclined to look at adaptation to any special climate as a quality readily grafted on an innate wide flexibility of constitution, which is common to most animals. on this view, the capacity of enduring the most different climates by man himself and by his domestic animals, and such facts as that former species of the elephant and rhinoceros were capable of enduring a glacial climate, whereas the living species are now all tropical or sub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked at as anomalies, but merely as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution, brought, under peculiar circumstances, into play. how much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is due to mere habit, and how much to the natural selection of varieties having different innate constitutions, and how much to both means combined, is a very obscure question. that habit or custom has some influence i must believe, both from analogy, and from the incessant advice given in agricultural works, even in the ancient encyclopaedias of china, to be very cautious in transposing animals from one district to another; for it is not likely that man should have succeeded in selecting so many breeds and sub-breeds with constitutions specially fitted for their own districts: the result must, i think, be due to habit. on the other hand, i can see no reason to doubt that natural selection will continually tend to preserve those individuals which are born with constitutions best adapted to their native countries. in treatises on many kinds of cultivated plants, certain varieties are said to withstand certain climates better than others: this is very strikingly shown in works on fruit trees published in the united states, in which certain varieties are habitually recommended for the northern, and others for the southern states; and as most of these varieties are of recent origin, they cannot owe their constitutional differences to habit. the case of the jerusalem artichoke, which is never propagated by seed, and of which consequently new varieties have not been produced, has even been advanced--for it is now as tender as ever it was--as proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected! the case, also, of the kidney-bean has been often cited for a similar purpose, and with much greater weight; but until some one will sow, during a score of generations, his kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by frost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with care to prevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from these seedlings, with the same precautions, the experiment cannot be said to have been even tried. nor let it be supposed that no differences in the constitution of seedling kidney-beans ever appear, for an account has been published how much more hardy some seedlings appeared to be than others. on the whole, i think we may conclude that habit, use, and disuse, have, in some cases, played a considerable part in the modification of the constitution, and of the structure of various organs; but that the effects of use and disuse have often been largely combined with, and sometimes overmastered by, the natural selection of innate differences. correlation of growth. i mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied together during its growth and development, that when slight variations in any one part occur, and are accumulated through natural selection, other parts become modified. this is a very important subject, most imperfectly understood. the most obvious case is, that modifications accumulated solely for the good of the young or larva, will, it may safely be concluded, affect the structure of the adult; in the same manner as any malconformation affecting the early embryo, seriously affects the whole organisation of the adult. the several parts of the body which are homologous, and which, at an early embryonic period, are alike, seem liable to vary in an allied manner: we see this in the right and left sides of the body varying in the same manner; in the front and hind legs, and even in the jaws and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw is believed to be homologous with the limbs. these tendencies, i do not doubt, may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection: thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side; and if this had been of any great use to the breed it might probably have been rendered permanent by natural selection. homologous parts, as has been remarked by some authors, tend to cohere; this is often seen in monstrous plants; and nothing is more common than the union of homologous parts in normal structures, as the union of the petals of the corolla into a tube. hard parts seem to affect the form of adjoining soft parts; it is believed by some authors that the diversity in the shape of the pelvis in birds causes the remarkable diversity in the shape of their kidneys. others believe that the shape of the pelvis in the human mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the child. in snakes, according to schlegel, the shape of the body and the manner of swallowing determine the position of several of the most important viscera. the nature of the bond of correlation is very frequently quite obscure. m. is. geoffroy st. hilaire has forcibly remarked, that certain malconformations very frequently, and that others rarely coexist, without our being able to assign any reason. what can be more singular than the relation between blue eyes and deafness in cats, and the tortoise-shell colour with the female sex; the feathered feet and skin between the outer toes in pigeons, and the presence of more or less down on the young birds when first hatched, with the future colour of their plumage; or, again, the relation between the hair and teeth in the naked turkish dog, though here probably homology comes into play? with respect to this latter case of correlation, i think it can hardly be accidental, that if we pick out the two orders of mammalia which are most abnormal in their dermal coverings, viz. cetacea (whales) and edentata (armadilloes, scaly ant-eaters, etc.), that these are likewise the most abnormal in their teeth. i know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of correlation in modifying important structures, independently of utility and, therefore, of natural selection, than that of the difference between the outer and inner flowers in some compositous and umbelliferous plants. every one knows the difference in the ray and central florets of, for instance, the daisy, and this difference is often accompanied with the abortion of parts of the flower. but, in some compositous plants, the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture; and even the ovary itself, with its accessory parts, differs, as has been described by cassini. these differences have been attributed by some authors to pressure, and the shape of the seeds in the ray-florets in some compositae countenances this idea; but, in the case of the corolla of the umbelliferae, it is by no means, as dr. hooker informs me, in species with the densest heads that the inner and outer flowers most frequently differ. it might have been thought that the development of the ray-petals by drawing nourishment from certain other parts of the flower had caused their abortion; but in some compositae there is a difference in the seeds of the outer and inner florets without any difference in the corolla. possibly, these several differences may be connected with some difference in the flow of nutriment towards the central and external flowers: we know, at least, that in irregular flowers, those nearest to the axis are oftenest subject to peloria, and become regular. i may add, as an instance of this, and of a striking case of correlation, that i have recently observed in some garden pelargoniums, that the central flower of the truss often loses the patches of darker colour in the two upper petals; and that when this occurs, the adherent nectary is quite aborted; when the colour is absent from only one of the two upper petals, the nectary is only much shortened. with respect to the difference in the corolla of the central and exterior flowers of a head or umbel, i do not feel at all sure that c. c. sprengel's idea that the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is highly advantageous in the fertilisation of plants of these two orders, is so far-fetched, as it may at first appear: and if it be advantageous, natural selection may have come into play. but in regard to the differences both in the internal and external structure of the seeds, which are not always correlated with any differences in the flowers, it seems impossible that they can be in any way advantageous to the plant: yet in the umbelliferae these differences are of such apparent importance--the seeds being in some cases, according to tausch, orthospermous in the exterior flowers and coelospermous in the central flowers,--that the elder de candolle founded his main divisions of the order on analogous differences. hence we see that modifications of structure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due to unknown laws of correlated growth, and without being, as far as we can see, of the slightest service to the species. we may often falsely attribute to correlation of growth, structures which are common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are simply due to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through natural selection some one modification in structure, and, after thousands of generations, some other and independent modification; and these two modifications, having been transmitted to a whole group of descendants with diverse habits, would naturally be thought to be correlated in some necessary manner. so, again, i do not doubt that some apparent correlations, occurring throughout whole orders, are entirely due to the manner alone in which natural selection can act. for instance, alph. de candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never found in fruits which do not open: i should explain the rule by the fact that seeds could not gradually become winged through natural selection, except in fruits which opened; so that the individual plants producing seeds which were a little better fitted to be wafted further, might get an advantage over those producing seed less fitted for dispersal; and this process could not possibly go on in fruit which did not open. the elder geoffroy and goethe propounded, at about the same period, their law of compensation or balancement of growth; or, as goethe expressed it, "in order to spend on one side, nature is forced to economise on the other side." i think this holds true to a certain extent with our domestic productions: if nourishment flows to one part or organ in excess, it rarely flows, at least in excess, to another part; thus it is difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fatten readily. the same varieties of the cabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage and a copious supply of oil-bearing seeds. when the seeds in our fruits become atrophied, the fruit itself gains largely in size and quality. in our poultry, a large tuft of feathers on the head is generally accompanied by a diminished comb, and a large beard by diminished wattles. with species in a state of nature it can hardly be maintained that the law is of universal application; but many good observers, more especially botanists, believe in its truth. i will not, however, here give any instances, for i see hardly any way of distinguishing between the effects, on the one hand, of a part being largely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining part being reduced by this same process or by disuse, and, on the other hand, the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to the excess of growth in another and adjoining part. i suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which have been advanced, and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a more general principle, namely, that natural selection is continually trying to economise in every part of the organisation. if under changed conditions of life a structure before useful becomes less useful, any diminution, however slight, in its development, will be seized on by natural selection, for it will profit the individual not to have its nutriment wasted in building up an useless structure. i can thus only understand a fact with which i was much struck when examining cirripedes, and of which many other instances could be given: namely, that when a cirripede is parasitic within another and is thus protected, it loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace. this is the case with the male ibla, and in a truly extraordinary manner with the proteolepas: for the carapace in all other cirripedes consists of the three highly-important anterior segments of the head enormously developed, and furnished with great nerves and muscles; but in the parasitic and protected proteolepas, the whole anterior part of the head is reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of the prehensile antennae. now the saving of a large and complex structure, when rendered superfluous by the parasitic habits of the proteolepas, though effected by slow steps, would be a decided advantage to each successive individual of the species; for in the struggle for life to which every animal is exposed, each individual proteolepas would have a better chance of supporting itself, by less nutriment being wasted in developing a structure now become useless. thus, as i believe, natural selection will always succeed in the long run in reducing and saving every part of the organisation, as soon as it is rendered superfluous, without by any means causing some other part to be largely developed in a corresponding degree. and, conversely, that natural selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing any organ, without requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of some adjoining part. it seems to be a rule, as remarked by is. geoffroy st. hilaire, both in varieties and in species, that when any part or organ is repeated many times in the structure of the same individual (as the vertebrae in snakes, and the stamens in polyandrous flowers) the number is variable; whereas the number of the same part or organ, when it occurs in lesser numbers, is constant. the same author and some botanists have further remarked that multiple parts are also very liable to variation in structure. inasmuch as this "vegetative repetition," to use professor owen's expression, seems to be a sign of low organisation; the foregoing remark seems connected with the very general opinion of naturalists, that beings low in the scale of nature are more variable than those which are higher. i presume that lowness in this case means that the several parts of the organisation have been but little specialised for particular functions; and as long as the same part has to perform diversified work, we can perhaps see why it should remain variable, that is, why natural selection should have preserved or rejected each little deviation of form less carefully than when the part has to serve for one special purpose alone. in the same way that a knife which has to cut all sorts of things may be of almost any shape; whilst a tool for some particular object had better be of some particular shape. natural selection, it should never be forgotten, can act on each part of each being, solely through and for its advantage. rudimentary parts, it has been stated by some authors, and i believe with truth, are apt to be highly variable. we shall have to recur to the general subject of rudimentary and aborted organs; and i will here only add that their variability seems to be owing to their uselessness, and therefore to natural selection having no power to check deviations in their structure. thus rudimentary parts are left to the free play of the various laws of growth, to the effects of long-continued disuse, and to the tendency to reversion. a part developed in any species in an extraordinary degree or manner, in comparison with the same part in allied species, tends to be highly variable. several years ago i was much struck with a remark, nearly to the above effect, published by mr. waterhouse. i infer also from an observation made by professor owen, with respect to the length of the arms of the ourang-outang, that he has come to a nearly similar conclusion. it is hopeless to attempt to convince any one of the truth of this proposition without giving the long array of facts which i have collected, and which cannot possibly be here introduced. i can only state my conviction that it is a rule of high generality. i am aware of several causes of error, but i hope that i have made due allowance for them. it should be understood that the rule by no means applies to any part, however unusually developed, unless it be unusually developed in comparison with the same part in closely allied species. thus, the bat's wing is a most abnormal structure in the class mammalia; but the rule would not here apply, because there is a whole group of bats having wings; it would apply only if some one species of bat had its wings developed in some remarkable manner in comparison with the other species of the same genus. the rule applies very strongly in the case of secondary sexual characters, when displayed in any unusual manner. the term, secondary sexual characters, used by hunter, applies to characters which are attached to one sex, but are not directly connected with the act of reproduction. the rule applies to males and females; but as females more rarely offer remarkable secondary sexual characters, it applies more rarely to them. the rule being so plainly applicable in the case of secondary sexual characters, may be due to the great variability of these characters, whether or not displayed in any unusual manner--of which fact i think there can be little doubt. but that our rule is not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the case of hermaphrodite cirripedes; and i may here add, that i particularly attended to mr. waterhouse's remark, whilst investigating this order, and i am fully convinced that the rule almost invariably holds good with cirripedes. i shall, in my future work, give a list of the more remarkable cases; i will here only briefly give one, as it illustrates the rule in its largest application. the opercular valves of sessile cirripedes (rock barnacles) are, in every sense of the word, very important structures, and they differ extremely little even in different genera; but in the several species of one genus, pyrgoma, these valves present a marvellous amount of diversification: the homologous valves in the different species being sometimes wholly unlike in shape; and the amount of variation in the individuals of several of the species is so great, that it is no exaggeration to state that the varieties differ more from each other in the characters of these important valves than do other species of distinct genera. as birds within the same country vary in a remarkably small degree, i have particularly attended to them, and the rule seems to me certainly to hold good in this class. i cannot make out that it applies to plants, and this would seriously have shaken my belief in its truth, had not the great variability in plants made it particularly difficult to compare their relative degrees of variability. when we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or manner in any species, the fair presumption is that it is of high importance to that species; nevertheless the part in this case is eminently liable to variation. why should this be so? on the view that each species has been independently created, with all its parts as we now see them, i can see no explanation. but on the view that groups of species have descended from other species, and have been modified through natural selection, i think we can obtain some light. in our domestic animals, if any part, or the whole animal, be neglected and no selection be applied, that part (for instance, the comb in the dorking fowl) or the whole breed will cease to have a nearly uniform character. the breed will then be said to have degenerated. in rudimentary organs, and in those which have been but little specialised for any particular purpose, and perhaps in polymorphic groups, we see a nearly parallel natural case; for in such cases natural selection either has not or cannot come into full play, and thus the organisation is left in a fluctuating condition. but what here more especially concerns us is, that in our domestic animals those points, which at the present time are undergoing rapid change by continued selection, are also eminently liable to variation. look at the breeds of the pigeon; see what a prodigious amount of difference there is in the beak of the different tumblers, in the beak and wattle of the different carriers, in the carriage and tail of our fantails, etc., these being the points now mainly attended to by english fanciers. even in the sub-breeds, as in the short-faced tumbler, it is notoriously difficult to breed them nearly to perfection, and frequently individuals are born which depart widely from the standard. there may be truly said to be a constant struggle going on between, on the one hand, the tendency to reversion to a less modified state, as well as an innate tendency to further variability of all kinds, and, on the other hand, the power of steady selection to keep the breed true. in the long run selection gains the day, and we do not expect to fail so far as to breed a bird as coarse as a common tumbler from a good short-faced strain. but as long as selection is rapidly going on, there may always be expected to be much variability in the structure undergoing modification. it further deserves notice that these variable characters, produced by man's selection, sometimes become attached, from causes quite unknown to us, more to one sex than to the other, generally to the male sex, as with the wattle of carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters. now let us turn to nature. when a part has been developed in an extraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other species of the same genus, we may conclude that this part has undergone an extraordinary amount of modification, since the period when the species branched off from the common progenitor of the genus. this period will seldom be remote in any extreme degree, as species very rarely endure for more than one geological period. an extraordinary amount of modification implies an unusually large and long-continued amount of variability, which has continually been accumulated by natural selection for the benefit of the species. but as the variability of the extraordinarily-developed part or organ has been so great and long-continued within a period not excessively remote, we might, as a general rule, expect still to find more variability in such parts than in other parts of the organisation, which have remained for a much longer period nearly constant. and this, i am convinced, is the case. that the struggle between natural selection on the one hand, and the tendency to reversion and variability on the other hand, will in the course of time cease; and that the most abnormally developed organs may be made constant, i can see no reason to doubt. hence when an organ, however abnormal it may be, has been transmitted in approximately the same condition to many modified descendants, as in the case of the wing of the bat, it must have existed, according to my theory, for an immense period in nearly the same state; and thus it comes to be no more variable than any other structure. it is only in those cases in which the modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great that we ought to find the generative variability, as it may be called, still present in a high degree. for in this case the variability will seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the individuals varying in the required manner and degree, and by the continued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less modified condition. the principle included in these remarks may be extended. it is notorious that specific characters are more variable than generic. to explain by a simple example what is meant. if some species in a large genus of plants had blue flowers and some had red, the colour would be only a specific character, and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species varying into red, or conversely; but if all the species had blue flowers, the colour would become a generic character, and its variation would be a more unusual circumstance. i have chosen this example because an explanation is not in this case applicable, which most naturalists would advance, namely, that specific characters are more variable than generic, because they are taken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly used for classing genera. i believe this explanation is partly, yet only indirectly, true; i shall, however, have to return to this subject in our chapter on classification. it would be almost superfluous to adduce evidence in support of the above statement, that specific characters are more variable than generic; but i have repeatedly noticed in works on natural history, that when an author has remarked with surprise that some important organ or part, which is generally very constant throughout large groups of species, has differed considerably in closely-allied species, that it has, also, been variable in the individuals of some of the species. and this fact shows that a character, which is generally of generic value, when it sinks in value and becomes only of specific value, often becomes variable, though its physiological importance may remain the same. something of the same kind applies to monstrosities: at least is. geoffroy st. hilaire seems to entertain no doubt, that the more an organ normally differs in the different species of the same group, the more subject it is to individual anomalies. on the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, why should that part of the structure, which differs from the same part in other independently-created species of the same genus, be more variable than those parts which are closely alike in the several species? i do not see that any explanation can be given. but on the view of species being only strongly marked and fixed varieties, we might surely expect to find them still often continuing to vary in those parts of their structure which have varied within a moderately recent period, and which have thus come to differ. or to state the case in another manner:--the points in which all the species of a genus resemble each other, and in which they differ from the species of some other genus, are called generic characters; and these characters in common i attribute to inheritance from a common progenitor, for it can rarely have happened that natural selection will have modified several species, fitted to more or less widely-different habits, in exactly the same manner: and as these so-called generic characters have been inherited from a remote period, since that period when the species first branched off from their common progenitor, and subsequently have not varied or come to differ in any degree, or only in a slight degree, it is not probable that they should vary at the present day. on the other hand, the points in which species differ from other species of the same genus, are called specific characters; and as these specific characters have varied and come to differ within the period of the branching off of the species from a common progenitor, it is probable that they should still often be in some degree variable,--at least more variable than those parts of the organisation which have for a very long period remained constant. in connexion with the present subject, i will make only two other remarks. i think it will be admitted, without my entering on details, that secondary sexual characters are very variable; i think it also will be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other more widely in their secondary sexual characters, than in other parts of their organisation; compare, for instance, the amount of difference between the males of gallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual characters are strongly displayed, with the amount of difference between their females; and the truth of this proposition will be granted. the cause of the original variability of secondary sexual characters is not manifest; but we can see why these characters should not have been rendered as constant and uniform as other parts of the organisation; for secondary sexual characters have been accumulated by sexual selection, which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection, as it does not entail death, but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured males. whatever the cause may be of the variability of secondary sexual characters, as they are highly variable, sexual selection will have had a wide scope for action, and may thus readily have succeeded in giving to the species of the same group a greater amount of difference in their sexual characters, than in other parts of their structure. it is a remarkable fact, that the secondary sexual differences between the two sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very same parts of the organisation in which the different species of the same genus differ from each other. of this fact i will give in illustration two instances, the first which happen to stand on my list; and as the differences in these cases are of a very unusual nature, the relation can hardly be accidental. the same number of joints in the tarsi is a character generally common to very large groups of beetles, but in the engidae, as westwood has remarked, the number varies greatly; and the number likewise differs in the two sexes of the same species: again in fossorial hymenoptera, the manner of neuration of the wings is a character of the highest importance, because common to large groups; but in certain genera the neuration differs in the different species, and likewise in the two sexes of the same species. this relation has a clear meaning on my view of the subject: i look at all the species of the same genus as having as certainly descended from the same progenitor, as have the two sexes of any one of the species. consequently, whatever part of the structure of the common progenitor, or of its early descendants, became variable; variations of this part would it is highly probable, be taken advantage of by natural and sexual selection, in order to fit the several species to their several places in the economy of nature, and likewise to fit the two sexes of the same species to each other, or to fit the males and females to different habits of life, or the males to struggle with other males for the possession of the females. finally, then, i conclude that the greater variability of specific characters, or those which distinguish species from species, than of generic characters, or those which the species possess in common;--that the frequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in a species in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part in its congeners; and the not great degree of variability in a part, however extraordinarily it may be developed, if it be common to a whole group of species;--that the great variability of secondary sexual characters, and the great amount of difference in these same characters between closely allied species;--that secondary sexual and ordinary specific differences are generally displayed in the same parts of the organisation,--are all principles closely connected together. all being mainly due to the species of the same group having descended from a common progenitor, from whom they have inherited much in common,--to parts which have recently and largely varied being more likely still to go on varying than parts which have long been inherited and have not varied,--to natural selection having more or less completely, according to the lapse of time, overmastered the tendency to reversion and to further variability,--to sexual selection being less rigid than ordinary selection,--and to variations in the same parts having been accumulated by natural and sexual selection, and thus adapted for secondary sexual, and for ordinary specific purposes. distinct species present analogous variations; and a variety of one species often assumes some of the characters of an allied species, or reverts to some of the characters of an early progenitor. these propositions will be most readily understood by looking to our domestic races. the most distinct breeds of pigeons, in countries most widely apart, present sub-varieties with reversed feathers on the head and feathers on the feet,--characters not possessed by the aboriginal rock-pigeon; these then are analogous variations in two or more distinct races. the frequent presence of fourteen or even sixteen tail-feathers in the pouter, may be considered as a variation representing the normal structure of another race, the fantail. i presume that no one will doubt that all such analogous variations are due to the several races of the pigeon having inherited from a common parent the same constitution and tendency to variation, when acted on by similar unknown influences. in the vegetable kingdom we have a case of analogous variation, in the enlarged stems, or roots as commonly called, of the swedish turnip and ruta baga, plants which several botanists rank as varieties produced by cultivation from a common parent: if this be not so, the case will then be one of analogous variation in two so-called distinct species; and to these a third may be added, namely, the common turnip. according to the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, we should have to attribute this similarity in the enlarged stems of these three plants, not to the vera causa of community of descent, and a consequent tendency to vary in a like manner, but to three separate yet closely related acts of creation. with pigeons, however, we have another case, namely, the occasional appearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds with two black bars on the wings, a white rump, a bar at the end of the tail, with the outer feathers externally edged near their bases with white. as all these marks are characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon, i presume that no one will doubt that this is a case of reversion, and not of a new yet analogous variation appearing in the several breeds. we may i think confidently come to this conclusion, because, as we have seen, these coloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring of two distinct and differently coloured breeds; and in this case there is nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance of the slaty-blue, with the several marks, beyond the influence of the mere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance. no doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear after having been lost for many, perhaps for hundreds of generations. but when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed, the offspring occasionally show a tendency to revert in character to the foreign breed for many generations--some say, for a dozen or even a score of generations. after twelve generations, the proportion of blood, to use a common expression, of any one ancestor, is only 1 in 2048; and yet, as we see, it is generally believed that a tendency to reversion is retained by this very small proportion of foreign blood. in a breed which has not been crossed, but in which both parents have lost some character which their progenitor possessed, the tendency, whether strong or weak, to reproduce the lost character might be, as was formerly remarked, for all that we can see to the contrary, transmitted for almost any number of generations. when a character which has been lost in a breed, reappears after a great number of generations, the most probable hypothesis is, not that the offspring suddenly takes after an ancestor some hundred generations distant, but that in each successive generation there has been a tendency to reproduce the character in question, which at last, under unknown favourable conditions, gains an ascendancy. for instance, it is probable that in each generation of the barb-pigeon, which produces most rarely a blue and black-barred bird, there has been a tendency in each generation in the plumage to assume this colour. this view is hypothetical, but could be supported by some facts; and i can see no more abstract improbability in a tendency to produce any character being inherited for an endless number of generations, than in quite useless or rudimentary organs being, as we all know them to be, thus inherited. indeed, we may sometimes observe a mere tendency to produce a rudiment inherited: for instance, in the common snapdragon (antirrhinum) a rudiment of a fifth stamen so often appears, that this plant must have an inherited tendency to produce it. as all the species of the same genus are supposed, on my theory, to have descended from a common parent, it might be expected that they would occasionally vary in an analogous manner; so that a variety of one species would resemble in some of its characters another species; this other species being on my view only a well-marked and permanent variety. but characters thus gained would probably be of an unimportant nature, for the presence of all important characters will be governed by natural selection, in accordance with the diverse habits of the species, and will not be left to the mutual action of the conditions of life and of a similar inherited constitution. it might further be expected that the species of the same genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to lost ancestral characters. as, however, we never know the exact character of the common ancestor of a group, we could not distinguish these two cases: if, for instance, we did not know that the rock-pigeon was not feather-footed or turn-crowned, we could not have told, whether these characters in our domestic breeds were reversions or only analogous variations; but we might have inferred that the blueness was a case of reversion, from the number of the markings, which are correlated with the blue tint, and which it does not appear probable would all appear together from simple variation. more especially we might have inferred this, from the blue colour and marks so often appearing when distinct breeds of diverse colours are crossed. hence, though under nature it must generally be left doubtful, what cases are reversions to an anciently existing character, and what are new but analogous variations, yet we ought, on my theory, sometimes to find the varying offspring of a species assuming characters (either from reversion or from analogous variation) which already occur in some other members of the same group. and this undoubtedly is the case in nature. a considerable part of the difficulty in recognising a variable species in our systematic works, is due to its varieties mocking, as it were, some of the other species of the same genus. a considerable catalogue, also, could be given of forms intermediate between two other forms, which themselves must be doubtfully ranked as either varieties or species; and this shows, unless all these forms be considered as independently created species, that the one in varying has assumed some of the characters of the other, so as to produce the intermediate form. but the best evidence is afforded by parts or organs of an important and uniform nature occasionally varying so as to acquire, in some degree, the character of the same part or organ in an allied species. i have collected a long list of such cases; but here, as before, i lie under a great disadvantage in not being able to give them. i can only repeat that such cases certainly do occur, and seem to me very remarkable. i will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed as affecting any important character, but from occurring in several species of the same genus, partly under domestication and partly under nature. it is a case apparently of reversion. the ass not rarely has very distinct transverse bars on its legs, like those on the legs of a zebra: it has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal, and from inquiries which i have made, i believe this to be true. it has also been asserted that the stripe on each shoulder is sometimes double. the shoulder stripe is certainly very variable in length and outline. a white ass, but not an albino, has been described without either spinal or shoulder-stripe; and these stripes are sometimes very obscure, or actually quite lost, in dark-coloured asses. the koulan of pallas is said to have been seen with a double shoulder-stripe. the hemionus has no shoulder-stripe; but traces of it, as stated by mr. blyth and others, occasionally appear: and i have been informed by colonel poole that the foals of this species are generally striped on the legs, and faintly on the shoulder. the quagga, though so plainly barred like a zebra over the body, is without bars on the legs; but dr. gray has figured one specimen with very distinct zebra-like bars on the hocks. with respect to the horse, i have collected cases in england of the spinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds, and of all colours; transverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns, mouse-duns, and in one instance in a chestnut: a faint shoulder-stripe may sometimes be seen in duns, and i have seen a trace in a bay horse. my son made a careful examination and sketch for me of a dun belgian cart-horse with a double stripe on each shoulder and with leg-stripes; and a man, whom i can implicitly trust, has examined for me a small dun welch pony with three short parallel stripes on each shoulder. in the north-west part of india the kattywar breed of horses is so generally striped, that, as i hear from colonel poole, who examined the breed for the indian government, a horse without stripes is not considered as purely-bred. the spine is always striped; the legs are generally barred; and the shoulder-stripe, which is sometimes double and sometimes treble, is common; the side of the face, moreover, is sometimes striped. the stripes are plainest in the foal; and sometimes quite disappear in old horses. colonel poole has seen both gray and bay kattywar horses striped when first foaled. i have, also, reason to suspect, from information given me by mr. w. w. edwards, that with the english race-horse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the foal than in the full-grown animal. without here entering on further details, i may state that i have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in horses of very different breeds, in various countries from britain to eastern china; and from norway in the north to the malay archipelago in the south. in all parts of the world these stripes occur far oftenest in duns and mouse-duns; by the term dun a large range of colour is included, from one between brown and black to a close approach to cream-colour. i am aware that colonel hamilton smith, who has written on this subject, believes that the several breeds of the horse have descended from several aboriginal species--one of which, the dun, was striped; and that the above-described appearances are all due to ancient crosses with the dun stock. but i am not at all satisfied with this theory, and should be loth to apply it to breeds so distinct as the heavy belgian cart-horse, welch ponies, cobs, the lanky kattywar race, etc., inhabiting the most distant parts of the world. now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the horse-genus. rollin asserts, that the common mule from the ass and horse is particularly apt to have bars on its legs. i once saw a mule with its legs so much striped that any one at first would have thought that it must have been the product of a zebra; and mr. w. c. martin, in his excellent treatise on the horse, has given a figure of a similar mule. in four coloured drawings, which i have seen, of hybrids between the ass and zebra, the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest of the body; and in one of them there was a double shoulder-stripe. in lord moreton's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the hybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga. lastly, and this is another most remarkable case, a hybrid has been figured by dr. gray (and he informs me that he knows of a second case) from the ass and the hemionus; and this hybrid, though the ass seldom has stripes on its legs and the hemionus has none and has not even a shoulder-stripe, nevertheless had all four legs barred, and had three short shoulder-stripes, like those on the dun welch pony, and even had some zebra-like stripes on the sides of its face. with respect to this last fact, i was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour appears from what would commonly be called an accident, that i was led solely from the occurrence of the face-stripes on this hybrid from the ass and hemionus, to ask colonel poole whether such face-stripes ever occur in the eminently striped kattywar breed of horses, and was, as we have seen, answered in the affirmative. what now are we to say to these several facts? we see several very distinct species of the horse-genus becoming, by simple variation, striped on the legs like a zebra, or striped on the shoulders like an ass. in the horse we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint appears--a tint which approaches to that of the general colouring of the other species of the genus. the appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any change of form or by any other new character. we see this tendency to become striped most strongly displayed in hybrids from between several of the most distinct species. now observe the case of the several breeds of pigeons: they are descended from a pigeon (including two or three sub-species or geographical races) of a bluish colour, with certain bars and other marks; and when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish tint, these bars and other marks invariably reappear; but without any other change of form or character. when the oldest and truest breeds of various colours are crossed, we see a strong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to reappear in the mongrels. i have stated that the most probable hypothesis to account for the reappearance of very ancient characters, is--that there is a tendency in the young of each successive generation to produce the long-lost character, and that this tendency, from unknown causes, sometimes prevails. and we have just seen that in several species of the horse-genus the stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly in the young than in the old. call the breeds of pigeons, some of which have bred true for centuries, species; and how exactly parallel is the case with that of the species of the horse-genus! for myself, i venture confidently to look back thousands on thousands of generations, and i see an animal striped like a zebra, but perhaps otherwise very differently constructed, the common parent of our domestic horse, whether or not it be descended from one or more wild stocks, of the ass, the hemionus, quagga, and zebra. he who believes that each equine species was independently created, will, i presume, assert that each species has been created with a tendency to vary, both under nature and under domestication, in this particular manner, so as often to become striped like other species of the genus; and that each has been created with a strong tendency, when crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world, to produce hybrids resembling in their stripes, not their own parents, but other species of the genus. to admit this view is, as it seems to me, to reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown, cause. it makes the works of god a mere mockery and deception; i would almost as soon believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had never lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now living on the sea-shore. summary. our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound. not in one case out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part differs, more or less, from the same part in the parents. but whenever we have the means of instituting a comparison, the same laws appear to have acted in producing the lesser differences between varieties of the same species, and the greater differences between species of the same genus. the external conditions of life, as climate and food, etc., seem to have induced some slight modifications. habit in producing constitutional differences, and use in strengthening, and disuse in weakening and diminishing organs, seem to have been more potent in their effects. homologous parts tend to vary in the same way, and homologous parts tend to cohere. modifications in hard parts and in external parts sometimes affect softer and internal parts. when one part is largely developed, perhaps it tends to draw nourishment from the adjoining parts; and every part of the structure which can be saved without detriment to the individual, will be saved. changes of structure at an early age will generally affect parts subsequently developed; and there are very many other correlations of growth, the nature of which we are utterly unable to understand. multiple parts are variable in number and in structure, perhaps arising from such parts not having been closely specialised to any particular function, so that their modifications have not been closely checked by natural selection. it is probably from this same cause that organic beings low in the scale of nature are more variable than those which have their whole organisation more specialised, and are higher in the scale. rudimentary organs, from being useless, will be disregarded by natural selection, and hence probably are variable. specific characters--that is, the characters which have come to differ since the several species of the same genus branched off from a common parent--are more variable than generic characters, or those which have long been inherited, and have not differed within this same period. in these remarks we have referred to special parts or organs being still variable, because they have recently varied and thus come to differ; but we have also seen in the second chapter that the same principle applies to the whole individual; for in a district where many species of any genus are found--that is, where there has been much former variation and differentiation, or where the manufactory of new specific forms has been actively at work--there, on an average, we now find most varieties or incipient species. secondary sexual characters are highly variable, and such characters differ much in the species of the same group. variability in the same parts of the organisation has generally been taken advantage of in giving secondary sexual differences to the sexes of the same species, and specific differences to the several species of the same genus. any part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an extraordinary manner, in comparison with the same part or organ in the allied species, must have gone through an extraordinary amount of modification since the genus arose; and thus we can understand why it should often still be variable in a much higher degree than other parts; for variation is a long-continued and slow process, and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have had time to overcome the tendency to further variability and to reversion to a less modified state. but when a species with any extraordinarily-developed organ has become the parent of many modified descendants--which on my view must be a very slow process, requiring a long lapse of time--in this case, natural selection may readily have succeeded in giving a fixed character to the organ, in however extraordinary a manner it may be developed. species inheriting nearly the same constitution from a common parent and exposed to similar influences will naturally tend to present analogous variations, and these same species may occasionally revert to some of the characters of their ancient progenitors. although new and important modifications may not arise from reversion and analogous variation, such modifications will add to the beautiful and harmonious diversity of nature. whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from their parents--and a cause for each must exist--it is the steady accumulation, through natural selection, of such differences, when beneficial to the individual, that gives rise to all the more important modifications of structure, by which the innumerable beings on the face of this earth are enabled to struggle with each other, and the best adapted to survive. 6. difficulties on theory. difficulties on the theory of descent with modification. transitions. absence or rarity of transitional

them without being staggered; but, to the best of my judgment, the greater number are only apparent, and those that are real are not, i think, fatal to my theory. these difficulties and objections may be classed under the following heads:-- firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? why is not all nature in confusion instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined? secondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the modification of some animal with wholly different habits? can we believe that natural selection could produce, on the one hand, organs of trifling importance, such as the tail of a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, organs of such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet fully understand the inimitable perfection? thirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified through natural selection? what shall we say to so marvellous an instinct as that which leads the bee to make cells, which have practically anticipated the discoveries of profound mathematicians? fourthly, how can we account for species, when crossed, being sterile and producing sterile offspring, whereas, when varieties are crossed, their fertility is unimpaired? the two first heads shall be here discussed--instinct and hybridism in separate chapters. on the absence or rarity of transitional varieties. as natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications, each new form will tend in a fully-stocked country to take the place of, and finally to exterminate, its own less improved parent or other less-favoured forms with which it comes into competition. thus extinction and natural selection will, as we have seen, go hand in hand. hence, if we look at each species as descended from some other unknown form, both the parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have been exterminated by the very process of formation and perfection of the new form. but, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth? it will be much more convenient to discuss this question in the chapter on the imperfection of the geological record; and i will here only state that i believe the answer mainly lies in the record being incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed; the imperfection of the record being chiefly due to organic beings not inhabiting profound depths of the sea, and to their remains being embedded and preserved to a future age only in masses of sediment sufficiently thick and extensive to withstand an enormous amount of future degradation; and such fossiliferous masses can be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the shallow bed of the sea, whilst it slowly subsides. these contingencies will concur only rarely, and after enormously long intervals. whilst the bed of the sea is stationary or is rising, or when very little sediment is being deposited, there will be blanks in our geological history. the crust of the earth is a vast museum; but the natural collections have been made only at intervals of time immensely remote. but it may be urged that when several closely-allied species inhabit the same territory we surely ought to find at the present time many transitional forms. let us take a simple case: in travelling from north to south over a continent, we generally meet at successive intervals with closely allied or representative species, evidently filling nearly the same place in the natural economy of the land. these representative species often meet and interlock; and as the one becomes rarer and rarer, the other becomes more and more frequent, till the one replaces the other. but if we compare these species where they intermingle, they are generally as absolutely distinct from each other in every detail of structure as are specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each. by my theory these allied species have descended from a common parent; and during the process of modification, each has become adapted to the conditions of life of its own region, and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent and all the transitional varieties between its past and present states. hence we ought not to expect at the present time to meet with numerous transitional varieties in each region, though they must have existed there, and may be embedded there in a fossil condition. but in the intermediate region, having intermediate conditions of life, why do we not now find closely-linking intermediate varieties? this difficulty for a long time quite confounded me. but i think it can be in large part explained. in the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring, because an area is now continuous, that it has been continuous during a long period. geology would lead us to believe that almost every continent has been broken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods; and in such islands distinct species might have been separately formed without the possibility of intermediate varieties existing in the intermediate zones. by changes in the form of the land and of climate, marine areas now continuous must often have existed within recent times in a far less continuous and uniform condition than at present. but i will pass over this way of escaping from the difficulty; for i believe that many perfectly defined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas; though i do not doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas now continuous has played an important part in the formation of new species, more especially with freely-crossing and wandering animals. in looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area, we generally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory, then becoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines, and finally disappearing. hence the neutral territory between two representative species is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to each. we see the same fact in ascending mountains, and sometimes it is quite remarkable how abruptly, as alph. de candolle has observed, a common alpine species disappears. the same fact has been noticed by forbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge. to those who look at climate and the physical conditions of life as the all-important elements of distribution, these facts ought to cause surprise, as climate and height or depth graduate away insensibly. but when we bear in mind that almost every species, even in its metropolis, would increase immensely in numbers, were it not for other competing species; that nearly all either prey on or serve as prey for others; in short, that each organic being is either directly or indirectly related in the most important manner to other organic beings, we must see that the range of the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively depends on insensibly changing physical conditions, but in large part on the presence of other species, on which it depends, or by which it is destroyed, or with which it comes into competition; and as these species are already defined objects (however they may have become so), not blending one into another by insensible gradations, the range of any one species, depending as it does on the range of others, will tend to be sharply defined. moreover, each species on the confines of its range, where it exists in lessened numbers, will, during fluctuations in the number of its enemies or of its prey, or in the seasons, be extremely liable to utter extermination; and thus its geographical range will come to be still more sharply defined. if i am right in believing that allied or representative species, when inhabiting a continuous area, are generally so distributed that each has a wide range, with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them, in which they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as varieties do not essentially differ from species, the same rule will probably apply to both; and if we in imagination adapt a varying species to a very large area, we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas, and a third variety to a narrow intermediate zone. the intermediate variety, consequently, will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and lesser area; and practically, as far as i can make out, this rule holds good with varieties in a state of nature. i have met with striking instances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between well-marked varieties in the genus balanus. and it would appear from information given me by mr. watson, dr. asa gray, and mr. wollaston, that generally when varieties intermediate between two other forms occur, they are much rarer numerically than the forms which they connect. now, if we may trust these facts and inferences, and therefore conclude that varieties linking two other varieties together have generally existed in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, then, i think, we can understand why intermediate varieties should not endure for very long periods;--why as a general rule they should be exterminated and disappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked together. for any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked, run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large numbers; and in this particular case the intermediate form would be eminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both sides of it. but a far more important consideration, as i believe, is that, during the process of further modification, by which two varieties are supposed on my theory to be converted and perfected into two distinct species, the two which exist in larger numbers from inhabiting larger areas, will have a great advantage over the intermediate variety, which exists in smaller numbers in a narrow and intermediate zone. for forms existing in larger numbers will always have a better chance, within any given period, of presenting further favourable variations for natural selection to seize on, than will the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers. hence, the more common forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the less common forms, for these will be more slowly modified and improved. it is the same principle which, as i believe, accounts for the common species in each country, as shown in the second chapter, presenting on an average a greater number of well-marked varieties than do the rarer species. i may illustrate what i mean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept, one adapted to an extensive mountainous region; a second to a comparatively narrow, hilly tract; and a third to wide plains at the base; and that the inhabitants are all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve their stocks by selection; the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of the great holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breeds more quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow, hilly tract; and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed will soon take the place of the less improved hill breed; and thus the two breeds, which originally existed in greater numbers, will come into close contact with each other, without the interposition of the supplanted, intermediate hill-variety. to sum up, i believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined objects, and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of varying and intermediate links: firstly, because new varieties are very slowly formed, for variation is a very slow process, and natural selection can do nothing until favourable variations chance to occur, and until a place in the natural polity of the country can be better filled by some modification of some one or more of its inhabitants. and such new places will depend on slow changes of climate, or on the occasional immigration of new inhabitants, and, probably, in a still more important degree, on some of the old inhabitants becoming slowly modified, with the new forms thus produced and the old ones acting and reacting on each other. so that, in any one region and at any one time, we ought only to see a few species presenting slight modifications of structure in some degree permanent; and this assuredly we do see. secondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within the recent period in isolated portions, in which many forms, more especially amongst the classes which unite for each birth and wander much, may have separately been rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative species. in this case, intermediate varieties between the several representative species and their common parent, must formerly have existed in each broken portion of the land, but these links will have been supplanted and exterminated during the process of natural selection, so that they will no longer exist in a living state. thirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different portions of a strictly continuous area, intermediate varieties will, it is probable, at first have been formed in the intermediate zones, but they will generally have had a short duration. for these intermediate varieties will, from reasons already assigned (namely from what we know of the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species, and likewise of acknowledged varieties), exist in the intermediate zones in lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to connect. from this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental extermination; and during the process of further modification through natural selection, they will almost certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they connect; for these from existing in greater numbers will, in the aggregate, present more variation, and thus be further improved through natural selection and gain further advantages. lastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all the species of the same group together, must assuredly have existed; but the very process of natural selection constantly tends, as has been so often remarked, to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate links. consequently evidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil remains, which are preserved, as we shall in a future chapter attempt to show, in an extremely imperfect and intermittent record. on the origin and transitions of organic beings with peculiar habits and structure. it has been asked by the opponents of such views as i hold, how, for instance, a land carnivorous animal could have been converted into one with aquatic habits; for how could the animal in its transitional state have subsisted? it would be easy to show that within the same group carnivorous animals exist having every intermediate grade between truly aquatic and strictly terrestrial habits; and as each exists by a struggle for life, it is clear that each is well adapted in its habits to its place in nature. look at the mustela vison of north america, which has webbed feet and which resembles an otter in its fur, short legs, and form of tail; during summer this animal dives for and preys on fish, but during the long winter it leaves the frozen waters, and preys like other polecats on mice and land animals. if a different case had been taken, and it had been asked how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been converted into a flying bat, the question would have been far more difficult, and i could have given no answer. yet i think such difficulties have very little weight. here, as on other occasions, i lie under a heavy disadvantage, for out of the many striking cases which i have collected, i can give only one or two instances of transitional habits and structures in closely allied species of the same genus; and of diversified habits, either constant or occasional, in the same species. and it seems to me that nothing less than a long list of such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty in any particular case like that of the bat. look at the family of squirrels; here we have the finest gradation from animals with their tails only slightly flattened, and from others, as sir j. richardson has remarked, with the posterior part of their bodies rather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather full, to the so-called flying squirrels; and flying squirrels have their limbs and even the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of skin, which serves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the air to an astonishing distance from tree to tree. we cannot doubt that each structure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country, by enabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey, or to collect food more quickly, or, as there is reason to believe, by lessening the danger from occasional falls. but it does not follow from this fact that the structure of each squirrel is the best that it is possible to conceive under all natural conditions. let the climate and vegetation change, let other competing rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate, or old ones become modified, and all analogy would lead us to believe that some at least of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become exterminated, unless they also became modified and improved in structure in a corresponding manner. therefore, i can see no difficulty, more especially under changing conditions of life, in the continued preservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flank-membranes, each modification being useful, each being propagated, until by the accumulated effects of this process of natural selection, a perfect so-called flying squirrel was produced. now look at the galeopithecus or flying lemur, which formerly was falsely ranked amongst bats. it has an extremely wide flank-membrane, stretching from the corners of the jaw to the tail, and including the limbs and the elongated fingers: the flank membrane is, also, furnished with an extensor muscle. although no graduated links of structure, fitted for gliding through the air, now connect the galeopithecus with the other lemuridae, yet i can see no difficulty in supposing that such links formerly existed, and that each had been formed by the same steps as in the case of the less perfectly gliding squirrels; and that each grade of structure had been useful to its possessor. nor can i see any insuperable difficulty in further believing it possible that the membrane-connected fingers and fore-arm of the galeopithecus might be greatly lengthened by natural selection; and this, as far as the organs of flight are concerned, would convert it into a bat. in bats which have the wing-membrane extended from the top of the shoulder to the tail, including the hind-legs, we perhaps see traces of an apparatus originally constructed for gliding through the air rather than for flight. if about a dozen genera of birds had become extinct or were unknown, who would have ventured to have surmised that birds might have existed which used their wings solely as flappers, like the logger-headed duck (micropterus of eyton); as fins in the water and front legs on the land, like the penguin; as sails, like the ostrich; and functionally for no purpose, like the apteryx. yet the structure of each of these birds is good for it, under the conditions of life to which it is exposed, for each has to live by a struggle; but it is not necessarily the best possible under all possible conditions. it must not be inferred from these remarks that any of the grades of wing-structure here alluded to, which perhaps may all have resulted from disuse, indicate the natural steps by which birds have acquired their perfect power of flight; but they serve, at least, to show what diversified means of transition are possible. seeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the crustacea and mollusca are adapted to live on the land, and seeing that we have flying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most diversified types, and formerly had flying reptiles, it is conceivable that flying-fish, which now glide far through the air, slightly rising and turning by the aid of their fluttering fins, might have been modified into perfectly winged animals. if this had been effected, who would have ever imagined that in an early transitional state they had been inhabitants of the open ocean, and had used their incipient organs of flight exclusively, as far as we know, to escape being devoured by other fish? when we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit, as the wings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind that animals displaying early transitional grades of the structure will seldom continue to exist to the present day, for they will have been supplanted by the very process of perfection through natural selection. furthermore, we may conclude that transitional grades between structures fitted for very different habits of life will rarely have been developed at an early period in great numbers and under many subordinate forms. thus, to return to our imaginary illustration of the flying-fish, it does not seem probable that fishes capable of true flight would have been developed under many subordinate forms, for taking prey of many kinds in many ways, on the land and in the water, until their organs of flight had come to a high stage of perfection, so as to have given them a decided advantage over other animals in the battle for life. hence the chance of discovering species with transitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always be less, from their having existed in lesser numbers, than in the case of species with fully developed structures. i will now give two or three instances of diversified and of changed habits in the individuals of the same species. when either case occurs, it would be easy for natural selection to fit the animal, by some modification of its structure, for its changed habits, or exclusively for one of its several different habits. but it is difficult to tell, and immaterial for us, whether habits generally change first and structure afterwards; or whether slight modifications of structure lead to changed habits; both probably often change almost simultaneously. of cases of changed habits it will suffice merely to allude to that of the many british insects which now feed on exotic plants, or exclusively on artificial substances. of diversified habits innumerable instances could be given: i have often watched a tyrant flycatcher (saurophagus sulphuratus) in south america, hovering over one spot and then proceeding to another, like a kestrel, and at other times standing stationary on the margin of water, and then dashing like a kingfisher at a fish. in our own country the larger titmouse (parus major) may be seen climbing branches, almost like a creeper; it often, like a shrike, kills small birds by blows on the head; and i have many times seen and heard it hammering the seeds of the yew on a branch, and thus breaking them like a nuthatch. in north america the black bear was seen by hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus catching, like a whale, insects in the water. even in so extreme a case as this, if the supply of insects were constant, and if better adapted competitors did not already exist in the country, i can see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered, by natural selection, more and more aquatic in their structure and habits, with larger and larger mouths, till a creature was produced as monstrous as a whale. as we sometimes see individuals of a species following habits widely different from those both of their own species and of the other species of the same genus, we might expect, on my theory, that such individuals would occasionally have given rise to new species, having anomalous habits, and with their structure either slightly or considerably modified from that of their proper type. and such instances do occur in nature. can a more striking instance of adaptation be given than that of a woodpecker for climbing trees and for seizing insects in the chinks of the bark? yet in north america there are woodpeckers which feed largely on fruit, and others with elongated wings which chase insects on the wing; and on the plains of la plata, where not a tree grows, there is a woodpecker, which in every essential part of its organisation, even in its colouring, in the harsh tone of its voice, and undulatory flight, told me plainly of its close blood-relationship to our common species; yet it is a woodpecker which never climbs a tree! petrels are the most aerial and oceanic of birds, yet in the quiet sounds of tierra del fuego, the puffinuria berardi, in its general habits, in its astonishing power of diving, its manner of swimming, and of flying when unwillingly it takes flight, would be mistaken by any one for an auk or grebe; nevertheless, it is essentially a petrel, but with many parts of its organisation profoundly modified. on the other hand, the acutest observer by examining the dead body of the water-ouzel would never have suspected its sub-aquatic habits; yet this anomalous member of the strictly terrestrial thrush family wholly subsists by diving,--grasping the stones with its feet and using its wings under water. he who believes that each being has been created as we now see it, must occasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having habits and structure not at all in agreement. what can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming? yet there are upland geese with webbed feet which rarely or never go near the water; and no one except audubon has seen the frigate-bird, which has all its four toes webbed, alight on the surface of the sea. on the other hand, grebes and coots are eminently aquatic, although their toes are only bordered by membrane. what seems plainer than that the long toes of grallatores are formed for walking over swamps and floating plants, yet the water-hen is nearly as aquatic as the coot; and the landrail nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge. in such cases, and many others could be given, habits have changed without a corresponding change of structure. the webbed feet of the upland goose may be said to have become rudimentary in function, though not in structure. in the frigate-bird, the deeply-scooped membrane between the toes shows that structure has begun to change. he who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation will say, that in these cases it has pleased the creator to cause a being of one type to take the place of one of another type; but this seems to me only restating the fact in dignified language. he who believes in the struggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection, will acknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring to increase in numbers; and that if any one being vary ever so little, either in habits or structure, and thus gain an advantage over some other inhabitant of the country, it will seize on the place of that inhabitant, however different it may be from its own place. hence it will cause him no surprise that there should be geese and frigate-birds with webbed feet, either living on the dry land or most rarely alighting on the water; that there should be long-toed corncrakes living in meadows instead of in swamps; that there should be woodpeckers where not a tree grows; that there should be diving thrushes, and petrels with the habits of auks. organs of extreme perfection and complication. to suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, i freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree. yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real. how a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself first originated; but i may remark that several facts make me suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light, and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound. in looking for the gradations by which an organ in any species has been perfected, we ought to look exclusively to its lineal ancestors; but this is scarcely ever possible, and we are forced in each case to look to species of the same group, that is to the collateral descendants from the same original parent-form, in order to see what gradations are possible, and for the chance of some gradations having been transmitted from the earlier stages of descent, in an unaltered or little altered condition. amongst existing vertebrata, we find but a small amount of gradation in the structure of the eye, and from fossil species we can learn nothing on this head. in this great class we should probably have to descend far beneath the lowest known fossiliferous stratum to discover the earlier stages, by which the eye has been perfected. in the articulata we can commence a series with an optic nerve merely coated with pigment, and without any other mechanism; and from this low stage, numerous gradations of structure, branching off in two fundamentally different lines, can be shown to exist, until we reach a moderately high stage of perfection. in certain crustaceans, for instance, there is a double cornea, the inner one divided into facets, within each of which there is a lens-shaped swelling. in other crustaceans the transparent cones which are coated by pigment, and which properly act only by excluding lateral pencils of light, are convex at their upper ends and must act by convergence; and at their lower ends there seems to be an imperfect vitreous substance. with these facts, here far too briefly and imperfectly given, which show that there is much graduated diversity in the eyes of living crustaceans, and bearing in mind how small the number of living animals is in proportion to those which have become extinct, i can see no very great difficulty (not more than in the case of many other structures) in believing that natural selection has converted the simple apparatus of an optic nerve merely coated with pigment and invested by transparent membrane, into an optical instrument as perfect as is possessed by any member of the great articulate class. he who will go thus far, if he find on finishing this treatise that large bodies of facts, otherwise inexplicable, can be explained by the theory of descent, ought not to hesitate to go further, and to admit that a structure even as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be formed by natural selection, although in this case he does not know any of the transitional grades. his reason ought to conquer his imagination; though i have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any degree of hesitation in extending the principle of natural selection to such startling lengths. it is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope. we know that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. but may not this inference be presumptuous? have we any right to assume that the creator works by intellectual powers like those of man? if we must compare the eye to an optical instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick layer of transparent tissue, with a nerve sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this layer to be continually changing slowly in density, so as to separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses, placed at different distances from each other, and with the surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form. further we must suppose that there is a power always intently watching each slight accidental alteration in the transparent layers; and carefully selecting each alteration which, under varied circumstances, may in any way, or in any degree, tend to produce a distincter image. we must suppose each new state of the instrument to be multiplied by the million; and each to be preserved till a better be produced, and then the old ones to be destroyed. in living bodies, variation will cause the slight alterations, generation will multiply them almost infinitely, and natural selection will pick out with unerring skill each improvement. let this process go on for millions on millions of years; and during each year on millions of individuals of many kinds; and may we not believe that a living optical instrument might thus be formed as superior to one of glass, as the works of the creator are to those of man? if it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. but i can find out no such case. no doubt many organs exist of which we do not know the transitional grades, more especially if we look to much-isolated species, round which, according to my theory, there has been much extinction. or again, if we look to an organ common to all the members of a large class, for in this latter case the organ must have been first formed at an extremely remote period, since which all the many members of the class have been developed; and in order to discover the early transitional grades through which the organ has passed, we should have to look to very ancient ancestral forms, long since become extinct. we should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not have been formed by transitional gradations of some kind. numerous cases could be given amongst the lower animals of the same organ performing at the same time wholly distinct functions; thus the alimentary canal respires, digests, and excretes in the larva of the dragon-fly and in the fish cobites. in the hydra, the animal may be turned inside out, and the exterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire. in such cases natural selection might easily specialise, if any advantage were thus gained, a part or organ, which had performed two functions, for one function alone, and thus wholly change its nature by insensible steps. two distinct organs sometimes perform simultaneously the same function in the same individual; to give one instance, there are fish with gills or branchiae that breathe the air dissolved in the water, at the same time that they breathe free air in their swimbladders, this latter organ having a ductus pneumaticus for its supply, and being divided by highly vascular partitions. in these cases, one of the two organs might with ease be modified and perfected so as to perform all the work by itself, being aided during the process of modification by the other organ; and then this other organ might be modified for some other and quite distinct purpose, or be quite obliterated. the illustration of the swimbladder in fishes is a good one, because it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally constructed for one purpose, namely flotation, may be converted into one for a wholly different purpose, namely respiration. the swimbladder has, also, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain fish, or, for i do not know which view is now generally held, a part of the auditory apparatus has been worked in as a complement to the swimbladder. all physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous, or "ideally similar," in position and structure with the lungs of the higher vertebrate animals: hence there seems to me to be no great difficulty in believing that natural selection has actually converted a swimbladder into a lung, or organ used exclusively for respiration. i can, indeed, hardly doubt that all vertebrate animals having true lungs have descended by ordinary generation from an ancient prototype, of which we know nothing, furnished with a floating apparatus or swimbladder. we can thus, as i infer from professor owen's interesting description of these parts, understand the strange fact that every particle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over the orifice of the trachea, with some risk of falling into the lungs, notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottis is closed. in the higher vertebrata the branchiae have wholly disappeared--the slits on the sides of the neck and the loop-like course of the arteries still marking in the embryo their former position. but it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiae might have been gradually worked in by natural selection for some quite distinct purpose: in the same manner as, on the view entertained by some naturalists that the branchiae and dorsal scales of annelids are homologous with the wings and wing-covers of insects, it is probable that organs which at a very ancient period served for respiration have been actually converted into organs of flight. in considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear in mind the probability of conversion from one function to another, that i will give one more instance. pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds of skin, called by me the ovigerous frena, which serve, through the means of a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs until they are hatched within the sack. these cirripedes have no branchiae, the whole surface of the body and sack, including the small frena, serving for respiration. the balanidae or sessile cirripedes, on the other hand, have no ovigerous frena, the eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack, in the well-enclosed shell; but they have large folded branchiae. now i think no one will dispute that the ovigerous frena in the one family are strictly homologous with the branchiae of the other family; indeed, they graduate into each other. therefore i do not doubt that little folds of skin, which originally served as ovigerous frena, but which, likewise, very slightly aided the act of respiration, have been gradually converted by natural selection into branchiae, simply through an increase in their size and the obliteration of their adhesive glands. if all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct, and they have already suffered far more extinction than have sessile cirripedes, who would ever have imagined that the branchiae in this latter family had originally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being washed out of the sack? although we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ could not possibly have been produced by successive transitional gradations, yet, undoubtedly, grave cases of difficulty occur, some of which will be discussed in my future work. one of the gravest is that of neuter insects, which are often very differently constructed from either the males or fertile females; but this case will be treated of in the next chapter. the electric organs of fishes offer another case of special difficulty; it is impossible to conceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been produced; but, as owen and others have remarked, their intimate structure closely resembles that of common muscle; and as it has lately been shown that rays have an organ closely analogous to the electric apparatus, and yet do not, as matteuchi asserts, discharge any electricity, we must own that we are far too ignorant to argue that no transition of any kind is possible. the electric organs offer another and even more serious difficulty; for they occur in only about a dozen fishes, of which several are widely remote in their affinities. generally when the same organ appears in several members of the same class, especially if in members having very different habits of life, we may attribute its presence to inheritance from a common ancestor; and its absence in some of the members to its loss through disuse or natural selection. but if the electric organs had been inherited from one ancient progenitor thus provided, we might have expected that all electric fishes would have been specially related to each other. nor does geology at all lead to the belief that formerly most fishes had electric organs, which most of their modified descendants have lost. the presence of luminous organs in a few insects, belonging to different families and orders, offers a parallel case of difficulty. other cases could be given; for instance in plants, the very curious contrivance of a mass of pollen-grains, borne on a foot-stalk with a sticky gland at the end, is the same in orchis and asclepias,--genera almost as remote as possible amongst flowering plants. in all these cases of two very distinct species furnished with apparently the same anomalous organ, it should be observed that, although the general appearance and function of the organ may be the same, yet some fundamental difference can generally be detected. i am inclined to believe that in nearly the same way as two men have sometimes independently hit on the very same invention, so natural selection, working for the good of each being and taking advantage of analogous variations, has sometimes modified in very nearly the same manner two parts in two organic beings, which owe but little of their structure in common to inheritance from the same ancestor. although in many cases it is most difficult to conjecture by what transitions an organ could have arrived at its present state; yet, considering that the proportion of living and known forms to the extinct and unknown is very small, i have been astonished how rarely an organ can be named, towards which no transitional grade is known to lead. the truth of this remark is indeed shown by that old canon in natural history of "natura non facit saltum." we meet with this admission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist; or, as milne edwards has well expressed it, nature is prodigal in variety, but niggard in innovation. why, on the theory of creation, should this be so? why should all the parts and organs of many independent beings, each supposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature, be so invariably linked together by graduated steps? why should not nature have taken a leap from structure to structure? on the theory of natural selection, we can clearly understand why she should not; for natural selection can act only by taking advantage of slight successive variations; she can never take a leap, but must advance by the shortest and slowest steps. organs of little apparent importance. as natural selection acts by life and death,--by the preservation of individuals with any favourable variation, and by the destruction of those with any unfavourable deviation of structure,--i have sometimes felt much difficulty in understanding the origin of simple parts, of which the importance does not seem sufficient to cause the preservation of successively varying individuals. i have sometimes felt as much difficulty, though of a very different kind, on this head, as in the case of an organ as perfect and complex as the eye. in the first place, we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole economy of any one organic being, to say what slight modifications would be of importance or not. in a former chapter i have given instances of most trifling characters, such as the down on fruit and the colour of the flesh, which, from determining the attacks of insects or from being correlated with constitutional differences, might assuredly be acted on by natural selection. the tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially constructed fly-flapper; and it seems at first incredible that this could have been adapted for its present purpose by successive slight modifications, each better and better, for so trifling an object as driving away flies; yet we should pause before being too positive even in this case, for we know that the distribution and existence of cattle and other animals in south america absolutely depends on their power of resisting the attacks of insects: so that individuals which could by any means defend themselves from these small enemies, would be able to range into new pastures and thus gain a great advantage. it is not that the larger quadrupeds are actually destroyed (except in some rare cases) by the flies, but they are incessantly harassed and their strength reduced, so that they are more subject to disease, or not so well enabled in a coming dearth to search for food, or to escape from beasts of prey. organs now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been of high importance to an early progenitor, and, after having been slowly perfected at a former period, have been transmitted in nearly the same state, although now become of very slight use; and any actually injurious deviations in their structure will always have been checked by natural selection. seeing how important an organ of locomotion the tail is in most aquatic animals, its general presence and use for many purposes in so many land animals, which in their lungs or modified swim-bladders betray their aquatic origin, may perhaps be thus accounted for. a well-developed tail having been formed in an aquatic animal, it might subsequently come to be worked in for all sorts of purposes, as a fly-flapper, an organ of prehension, or as an aid in turning, as with the dog, though the aid must be slight, for the hare, with hardly any tail, can double quickly enough. in the second place, we may sometimes attribute importance to characters which are really of very little importance, and which have originated from quite secondary causes, independently of natural selection. we should remember that climate, food, etc., probably have some little direct influence on the organisation; that characters reappear from the law of reversion; that correlation of growth will have had a most important influence in modifying various structures; and finally, that sexual selection will often have largely modified the external characters of animals having a will, to give one male an advantage in fighting with another or in charming the females. moreover when a modification of structure has primarily arisen from the above or other unknown causes, it may at first have been of no advantage to the species, but may subsequently have been taken advantage of by the descendants of the species under new conditions of life and with newly acquired habits. to give a few instances to illustrate these latter remarks. if green woodpeckers alone had existed, and we did not know that there were many black and pied kinds, i dare say that we should have thought that the green colour was a beautiful adaptation to hide this tree-frequenting bird from its enemies; and consequently that it was a character of importance and might have been acquired through natural selection; as it is, i have no doubt that the colour is due to some quite distinct cause, probably to sexual selection. a trailing bamboo in the malay archipelago climbs the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the ends of the branches, and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest service to the plant; but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees which are not climbers, the hooks on the bamboo may have arisen from unknown laws of growth, and have been subsequently taken advantage of by the plant undergoing further modification and becoming a climber. the naked skin on the head of a vulture is generally looked at as a direct adaptation for wallowing in putridity; and so it may be, or it may possibly be due to the direct action of putrid matter; but we should be very cautious in drawing any such inference, when we see that the skin on the head of the clean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked. the sutures in the skulls of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding parturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be indispensable for this act; but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles, which have only to escape from a broken egg, we may infer that this structure has arisen from the laws of growth, and has been taken advantage of in the parturition of the higher animals. we are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations; and we are immediately made conscious of this by reflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animals in different countries,--more especially in the less civilized countries where there has been but little artificial selection. careful observers are convinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair, and that with the hair the horns are correlated. mountain breeds always differ from lowland breeds; and a mountainous country would probably affect the hind limbs from exercising them more, and possibly even the form of the pelvis; and then by the law of homologous variation, the front limbs and even the head would probably be affected. the shape, also, of the pelvis might affect by pressure the shape of the head of the young in the womb. the laborious breathing necessary in high regions would, we have some reason to believe, increase the size of the chest; and again correlation would come into play. animals kept by savages in different countries often have to struggle for their own subsistence, and would be exposed to a certain extent to natural selection, and individuals with slightly different constitutions would succeed best under different climates; and there is reason to believe that constitution and colour are correlated. a good observer, also, states that in cattle susceptibility to the attacks of flies is correlated with colour, as is the liability to be poisoned by certain plants; so that colour would be thus subjected to the action of natural selection. but we are far too ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the several known and unknown laws of variation; and i have here alluded to them only to show that, if we are unable to account for the characteristic differences of our domestic breeds, which nevertheless we generally admit to have arisen through ordinary generation, we ought not to lay too much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause of the slight analogous differences between species. i might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; i may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous. the foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately made by some naturalists, against the utilitarian doctrine that every detail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor. they believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man, or for mere variety. this doctrine, if true, would be absolutely fatal to my theory. yet i fully admit that many structures are of no direct use to their possessors. physical conditions probably have had some little effect on structure, quite independently of any good thus gained. correlation of growth has no doubt played a most important part, and a useful modification of one part will often have entailed on other parts diversified changes of no direct use. so again characters which formerly were useful, or which formerly had arisen from correlation of growth, or from other unknown cause, may reappear from the law of reversion, though now of no direct use. the effects of sexual selection, when displayed in beauty to charm the females, can be called useful only in rather a forced sense. but by far the most important consideration is that the chief part of the organisation of every being is simply due to inheritance; and consequently, though each being assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature, many structures now have no direct relation to the habits of life of each species. thus, we can hardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland goose or of the frigate-bird are of special use to these birds; we cannot believe that the same bones in the arm of the monkey, in the fore leg of the horse, in the wing of the bat, and in the flipper of the seal, are of special use to these animals. we may safely attribute these structures to inheritance. but to the progenitor of the upland goose and of the frigate-bird, webbed feet no doubt were as useful as they now are to the most aquatic of existing birds. so we may believe that the progenitor of the seal had not a flipper, but a foot with five toes fitted for walking or grasping; and we may further venture to believe that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey, horse, and bat, which have been inherited from a common progenitor, were formerly of more special use to that progenitor, or its progenitors, than they now are to these animals having such widely diversified habits. therefore we may infer that these several bones might have been acquired through natural selection, subjected formerly, as now, to the several laws of inheritance, reversion, correlation of growth, etc. hence every detail of structure in every living creature (making some little allowance for the direct action of physical conditions) may be viewed, either as having been of special use to some ancestral form, or as being now of special use to the descendants of this form--either directly, or indirectly through the complex laws of growth. natural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in any one species exclusively for the good of another species; though throughout nature one species incessantly takes advantage of, and profits by, the structure of another. but natural selection can and does often produce structures for the direct injury of other species, as we see in the fang of the adder, and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon, by which its eggs are deposited in the living bodies of other insects. if it could be proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection. although many statements may be found in works on natural history to this effect, i cannot find even one which seems to me of any weight. it is admitted that the rattlesnake has a poison-fang for its own defence and for the destruction of its prey; but some authors suppose that at the same time this snake is furnished with a rattle for its own injury, namely, to warn its prey to escape. i would almost as soon believe that the cat curls the end of its tail when preparing to spring, in order to warn the doomed mouse. but i have not space here to enter on this and other such cases. natural selection will never produce in a being anything injurious to itself, for natural selection acts solely by and for the good of each. no organ will be formed, as paley has remarked, for the purpose of causing pain or for doing an injury to its possessor. if a fair balance be struck between the good and evil caused by each part, each will be found on the whole advantageous. after the lapse of time, under changing conditions of life, if any part comes to be injurious, it will be modified; or if it be not so, the being will become extinct, as myriads have become extinct. natural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as, or slightly more perfect than, the other inhabitants of the same country with which it has to struggle for existence. and we see that this is the degree of perfection attained under nature. the endemic productions of new zealand, for instance, are perfect one compared with another; but they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants and animals introduced from europe. natural selection will not produce absolute perfection, nor do we always meet, as far as we can judge, with this high standard under nature. the correction for the aberration of light is said, on high authority, not to be perfect even in that most perfect organ, the eye. if our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of inimitable contrivances in nature, this same reason tells us, though we may easily err on both sides, that some other contrivances are less perfect. can we consider the sting of the wasp or of the bee as perfect, which, when used against many attacking animals, cannot be withdrawn, owing to the backward serratures, and so inevitably causes the death of the insect by tearing out its viscera? if we look at the sting of the bee, as having originally existed in a remote progenitor as a boring and serrated instrument, like that in so many members of the same great order, and which has been modified but not perfected for its present purpose, with the poison originally adapted to cause galls subsequently intensified, we can perhaps understand how it is that the use of the sting should so often cause the insect's own death: for if on the whole the power of stinging be useful to the community, it will fulfil all the requirements of natural selection, though it may cause the death of some few members. if we admire the truly wonderful power of scent by which the males of many insects find their females, can we admire the production for this single purpose of thousands of drones, which are utterly useless to the community for any other end, and which are ultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile sisters? it may be difficult, but we ought to admire the savage instinctive hatred of the queen-bee, which urges her instantly to destroy the young queens her daughters as soon as born, or to perish herself in the combat; for undoubtedly this is for the good of the community; and maternal love or maternal hatred, though the latter fortunately is most rare, is all the same to the inexorable principle of natural selection. if we admire the several ingenious contrivances, by which the flowers of the orchis and of many other plants are fertilised through insect agency, can we consider as equally perfect the elaboration by our fir-trees of dense clouds of pollen, in order that a few granules may be wafted by a chance breeze on to the ovules? summary of chapter. we have in this chapter discussed some of the difficulties and objections which may be urged against my theory. many of them are very grave; but i think that in the discussion light has been thrown on several facts, which on the theory of independent acts of creation are utterly obscure. we have seen that species at any one period are not indefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude of intermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural selection will always be very slow, and will act, at any one time, only on a very few forms; and partly because the very process of natural selection almost implies the continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and intermediate gradations. closely allied species, now living on a continuous area, must often have been formed when the area was not continuous, and when the conditions of life did not insensibly graduate away from one part to another. when two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous area, an intermediate variety will often be formed, fitted for an intermediate zone; but from reasons assigned, the intermediate variety will usually exist in lesser numbers than the two forms which it connects; consequently the two latter, during the course of further modification, from existing in greater numbers, will have a great advantage over the less numerous intermediate variety, and will thus generally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it. we have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concluding that the most different habits of life could not graduate into each other; that a bat, for instance, could not have been formed by natural selection from an animal which at first could only glide through the air. we have seen that a species may under new conditions of life change its habits, or have diversified habits, with some habits very unlike those of its nearest congeners. hence we can understand, bearing in mind that each organic being is trying to live wherever it can live, how it has arisen that there are upland geese with webbed feet, ground woodpeckers, diving thrushes, and petrels with the habits of auks. although the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been formed by natural selection, is more than enough to stagger any one; yet in the case of any organ, if we know of a long series of gradations in complexity, each good for its possessor, then, under changing conditions of life, there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of any conceivable degree of perfection through natural selection. in the cases in which we know of no intermediate or transitional states, we should be very cautious in concluding that none could have existed, for the homologies of many organs and their intermediate states show that wonderful metamorphoses in function are at least possible. for instance, a swim-bladder has apparently been converted into an air-breathing lung. the same organ having performed simultaneously very different functions, and then having been specialised for one function; and two very distinct organs having performed at the same time the same function, the one having been perfected whilst aided by the other, must often have largely facilitated transitions. we are far too ignorant, in almost every case, to be enabled to assert that any part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species, that modifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated by means of natural selection. but we may confidently believe that many modifications, wholly due to the laws of growth, and at first in no way advantageous to a species, have been subsequently taken advantage of by the still further modified descendants of this species. we may, also, believe that a part formerly of high importance has often been retained (as the tail of an aquatic animal by its terrestrial descendants), though it has become of such small importance that it could not, in its present state, have been acquired by natural selection,--a power which acts solely by the preservation of profitable variations in the struggle for life. natural selection will produce nothing in one species for the exclusive good or injury of another; though it may well produce parts, organs, and excretions highly useful or even indispensable, or highly injurious to another species, but in all cases at the same time useful to the owner. natural selection in each well-stocked country, must act chiefly through the competition of the inhabitants one with another, and consequently will produce perfection, or strength in the battle for life, only according to the standard of that country. hence the inhabitants of one country, generally the smaller one, will often yield, as we see they do yield, to the inhabitants of another and generally larger country. for in the larger country there will have existed more individuals, and more diversified forms, and the competition will have been severer, and thus the standard of perfection will have been rendered higher. natural selection will not necessarily produce absolute perfection; nor, as far as we can judge by our limited faculties, can absolute perfection be everywhere found. on the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full meaning of that old canon in natural history, "natura non facit saltum." this canon, if we look only to the present inhabitants of the world, is not strictly correct, but if we include all those of past times, it must by my theory be strictly true. it is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on two great laws--unity of type, and the conditions of existence. by unity of type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure, which we see in organic beings of the same class, and which is quite independent of their habits of life. on my theory, unity of type is explained by unity of descent. the expression of conditions of existence, so often insisted on by the illustrious cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of natural selection. for natural selection acts by either now adapting the varying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life; or by having adapted them during long-past periods of time: the adaptations being aided in some cases by use and disuse, being slightly affected by the direct action of the external conditions of life, and being in all cases subjected to the several laws of growth. hence, in fact, the law of the conditions of existence is the higher law; as it includes, through the inheritance of former adaptations, that of unity of type. 7. instinct. instincts comparable with habits, but different in their origin. instincts graduated. aphides and ants.

to treat the subject separately, especially as so wonderful an instinct as that of the hive-bee making its cells will probably have occurred to many readers, as a difficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole theory. i must premise, that i have nothing to do with the origin of the primary mental powers, any more than i have with that of life itself. we are concerned only with the diversities of instinct and of the other mental qualities of animals within the same class. i will not attempt any definition of instinct. it would be easy to show that several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term; but every one understands what is meant, when it is said that instinct impels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds' nests. an action, which we ourselves should require experience to enable us to perform, when performed by an animal, more especially by a very young one, without any experience, and when performed by many individuals in the same way, without their knowing for what purpose it is performed, is usually said to be instinctive. but i could show that none of these characters of instinct are universal. a little dose, as pierre huber expresses it, of judgment or reason, often comes into play, even in animals very low in the scale of nature. frederick cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared instinct with habit. this comparison gives, i think, a remarkably accurate notion of the frame of mind under which an instinctive action is performed, but not of its origin. how unconsciously many habitual actions are performed, indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious will! yet they may be modified by the will or reason. habits easily become associated with other habits, and with certain periods of time and states of the body. when once acquired, they often remain constant throughout life. several other points of resemblance between instincts and habits could be pointed out. as in repeating a well-known song, so in instincts, one action follows another by a sort of rhythm; if a person be interrupted in a song, or in repeating anything by rote, he is generally forced to go back to recover the habitual train of thought: so p. huber found it was with a caterpillar, which makes a very complicated hammock; for if he took a caterpillar which had completed its hammock up to, say, the sixth stage of construction, and put it into a hammock completed up only to the third stage, the caterpillar simply re-performed the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages of construction. if, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from feeling the benefit of this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third stage, where it had left off, and thus tried to complete the already finished work. if we suppose any habitual action to become inherited--and i think it can be shown that this does sometimes happen--then the resemblance between what originally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to be distinguished. if mozart, instead of playing the pianoforte at three years old with wonderfully little practice, had played a tune with no practice at all, he might truly be said to have done so instinctively. but it would be the most serious error to suppose that the greater number of instincts have been acquired by habit in one generation, and then transmitted by inheritance to succeeding generations. it can be clearly shown that the most wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted, namely, those of the hive-bee and of many ants, could not possibly have been thus acquired. it will be universally admitted that instincts are as important as corporeal structure for the welfare of each species, under its present conditions of life. under changed conditions of life, it is at least possible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a species; and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little, then i can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and continually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that may be profitable. it is thus, as i believe, that all the most complex and wonderful instincts have originated. as modifications of corporeal structure arise from, and are increased by, use or habit, and are diminished or lost by disuse, so i do not doubt it has been with instincts. but i believe that the effects of habit are of quite subordinate importance to the effects of the natural selection of what may be called accidental variations of instincts;--that is of variations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight deviations of bodily structure. no complex instinct can possibly be produced through natural selection, except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous, slight, yet profitable, variations. hence, as in the case of corporeal structures, we ought to find in nature, not the actual transitional gradations by which each complex instinct has been acquired--for these could be found only in the lineal ancestors of each species--but we ought to find in the collateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations; or we ought at least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are possible; and this we certainly can do. i have been surprised to find, making allowance for the instincts of animals having been but little observed except in europe and north america, and for no instinct being known amongst extinct species, how very generally gradations, leading to the most complex instincts, can be discovered. the canon of "natura non facit saltum" applies with almost equal force to instincts as to bodily organs. changes of instinct may sometimes be facilitated by the same species having different instincts at different periods of life, or at different seasons of the year, or when placed under different circumstances, etc.; in which case either one or the other instinct might be preserved by natural selection. and such instances of diversity of instinct in the same species can be shown to occur in nature. again as in the case of corporeal structure, and conformably with my theory, the instinct of each species is good for itself, but has never, as far as we can judge, been produced for the exclusive good of others. one of the strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an action for the sole good of another, with which i am acquainted, is that of aphides voluntarily yielding their sweet excretion to ants: that they do so voluntarily, the following facts show. i removed all the ants from a group of about a dozen aphides on a dock-plant, and prevented their attendance during several hours. after this interval, i felt sure that the aphides would want to excrete. i watched them for some time through a lens, but not one excreted; i then tickled and stroked them with a hair in the same manner, as well as i could, as the ants do with their antennae; but not one excreted. afterwards i allowed an ant to visit them, and it immediately seemed, by its eager way of running about, to be well aware what a rich flock it had discovered; it then began to play with its antennae on the abdomen first of one aphis and then of another; and each aphis, as soon as it felt the antennae, immediately lifted up its abdomen and excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice, which was eagerly devoured by the ant. even the quite young aphides behaved in this manner, showing that the action was instinctive, and not the result of experience. but as the excretion is extremely viscid, it is probably a convenience to the aphides to have it removed; and therefore probably the aphides do not instinctively excrete for the sole good of the ants. although i do not believe that any animal in the world performs an action for the exclusive good of another of a distinct species, yet each species tries to take advantage of the instincts of others, as each takes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of others. so again, in some few cases, certain instincts cannot be considered as absolutely perfect; but as details on this and other such points are not indispensable, they may be here passed over. as some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature, and the inheritance of such variations, are indispensable for the action of natural selection, as many instances as possible ought to have been here given; but want of space prevents me. i can only assert, that instincts certainly do vary--for instance, the migratory instinct, both in extent and direction, and in its total loss. so it is with the nests of birds, which vary partly in dependence on the situations chosen, and on the nature and temperature of the country inhabited, but often from causes wholly unknown to us: audubon has given several remarkable cases of differences in nests of the same species in the northern and southern united states. fear of any particular enemy is certainly an instinctive quality, as may be seen in nestling birds, though it is strengthened by experience, and by the sight of fear of the same enemy in other animals. but fear of man is slowly acquired, as i have elsewhere shown, by various animals inhabiting desert islands; and we may see an instance of this, even in england, in the greater wildness of all our large birds than of our small birds; for the large birds have been most persecuted by man. we may safely attribute the greater wildness of our large birds to this cause; for in uninhabited islands large birds are not more fearful than small; and the magpie, so wary in england, is tame in norway, as is the hooded crow in egypt. that the general disposition of individuals of the same species, born in a state of nature, is extremely diversified, can be shown by a multitude of facts. several cases also, could be given, of occasional and strange habits in certain species, which might, if advantageous to the species, give rise, through natural selection, to quite new instincts. but i am well aware that these general statements, without facts given in detail, can produce but a feeble effect on the reader's mind. i can only repeat my assurance, that i do not speak without good evidence. the possibility, or even probability, of inherited variations of instinct in a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly considering a few cases under domestication. we shall thus also be enabled to see the respective parts which habit and the selection of so-called accidental variations have played in modifying the mental qualities of our domestic animals. a number of curious and authentic instances could be given of the inheritance of all shades of disposition and tastes, and likewise of the oddest tricks, associated with certain frames of mind or periods of time. but let us look to the familiar case of the several breeds of dogs: it cannot be doubted that young pointers (i have myself seen a striking instance) will sometimes point and even back other dogs the very first time that they are taken out; retrieving is certainly in some degree inherited by retrievers; and a tendency to run round, instead of at, a flock of sheep, by shepherd-dogs. i cannot see that these actions, performed without experience by the young, and in nearly the same manner by each individual, performed with eager delight by each breed, and without the end being known,--for the young pointer can no more know that he points to aid his master, than the white butterfly knows why she lays her eggs on the leaf of the cabbage,--i cannot see that these actions differ essentially from true instincts. if we were to see one kind of wolf, when young and without any training, as soon as it scented its prey, stand motionless like a statue, and then slowly crawl forward with a peculiar gait; and another kind of wolf rushing round, instead of at, a herd of deer, and driving them to a distant point, we should assuredly call these actions instinctive. domestic instincts, as they may be called, are certainly far less fixed or invariable than natural instincts; but they have been acted on by far less rigorous selection, and have been transmitted for an incomparably shorter period, under less fixed conditions of life. how strongly these domestic instincts, habits, and dispositions are inherited, and how curiously they become mingled, is well shown when different breeds of dogs are crossed. thus it is known that a cross with a bull-dog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacy of greyhounds; and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole family of shepherd-dogs a tendency to hunt hares. these domestic instincts, when thus tested by crossing, resemble natural instincts, which in a like manner become curiously blended together, and for a long period exhibit traces of the instincts of either parent: for example, le roy describes a dog, whose great-grandfather was a wolf, and this dog showed a trace of its wild parentage only in one way, by not coming in a straight line to his master when called. domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become inherited solely from long-continued and compulsory habit, but this, i think, is not true. no one would ever have thought of teaching, or probably could have taught, the tumbler-pigeon to tumble,--an action which, as i have witnessed, is performed by young birds, that have never seen a pigeon tumble. we may believe that some one pigeon showed a slight tendency to this strange habit, and that the long-continued selection of the best individuals in successive generations made tumblers what they now are; and near glasgow there are house-tumblers, as i hear from mr. brent, which cannot fly eighteen inches high without going head over heels. it may be doubted whether any one would have thought of training a dog to point, had not some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this line; and this is known occasionally to happen, as i once saw in a pure terrier. when the first tendency was once displayed, methodical selection and the inherited effects of compulsory training in each successive generation would soon complete the work; and unconscious selection is still at work, as each man tries to procure, without intending to improve the breed, dogs which will stand and hunt best. on the other hand, habit alone in some cases has sufficed; no animal is more difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit; scarcely any animal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit; but i do not suppose that domestic rabbits have ever been selected for tameness; and i presume that we must attribute the whole of the inherited change from extreme wildness to extreme tameness, simply to habit and long-continued close confinement. natural instincts are lost under domestication: a remarkable instance of this is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become "broody," that is, never wish to sit on their eggs. familiarity alone prevents our seeing how universally and largely the minds of our domestic animals have been modified by domestication. it is scarcely possible to doubt that the love of man has become instinctive in the dog. all wolves, foxes, jackals, and species of the cat genus, when kept tame, are most eager to attack poultry, sheep, and pigs; and this tendency has been found incurable in dogs which have been brought home as puppies from countries, such as tierra del fuego and australia, where the savages do not keep these domestic animals. how rarely, on the other hand, do our civilised dogs, even when quite young, require to be taught not to attack poultry, sheep, and pigs! no doubt they occasionally do make an attack, and are then beaten; and if not cured, they are destroyed; so that habit, with some degree of selection, has probably concurred in civilising by inheritance our dogs. on the other hand, young chickens have lost, wholly by habit, that fear of the dog and cat which no doubt was originally instinctive in them, in the same way as it is so plainly instinctive in young pheasants, though reared under a hen. it is not that chickens have lost all fear, but fear only of dogs and cats, for if the hen gives the danger-chuckle, they will run (more especially young turkeys) from under her, and conceal themselves in the surrounding grass or thickets; and this is evidently done for the instinctive purpose of allowing, as we see in wild ground-birds, their mother to fly away. but this instinct retained by our chickens has become useless under domestication, for the mother-hen has almost lost by disuse the power of flight. hence, we may conclude, that domestic instincts have been acquired and natural instincts have been lost partly by habit, and partly by man selecting and accumulating during successive generations, peculiar mental habits and actions, which at first appeared from what we must in our ignorance call an accident. in some cases compulsory habit alone has sufficed to produce such inherited mental changes; in other cases compulsory habit has done nothing, and all has been the result of selection, pursued both methodically and unconsciously; but in most cases, probably, habit and selection have acted together. we shall, perhaps, best understand how instincts in a state of nature have become modified by selection, by considering a few cases. i will select only three, out of the several which i shall have to discuss in my future work,--namely, the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay her eggs in other birds' nests; the slave-making instinct of certain ants; and the comb-making power of the hive-bee: these two latter instincts have generally, and most justly, been ranked by naturalists as the most wonderful of all known instincts. it is now commonly admitted that the more immediate and final cause of the cuckoo's instinct is, that she lays her eggs, not daily, but at intervals of two or three days; so that, if she were to make her own nest and sit on her own eggs, those first laid would have to be left for some time unincubated, or there would be eggs and young birds of different ages in the same nest. if this were the case, the process of laying and hatching might be inconveniently long, more especially as she has to migrate at a very early period; and the first hatched young would probably have to be fed by the male alone. but the american cuckoo is in this predicament; for she makes her own nest and has eggs and young successively hatched, all at the same time. it has been asserted that the american cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs in other birds' nests; but i hear on the high authority of dr. brewer, that this is a mistake. nevertheless, i could give several instances of various birds which have been known occasionally to lay their eggs in other birds' nests. now let us suppose that the ancient progenitor of our european cuckoo had the habits of the american cuckoo; but that occasionally she laid an egg in another bird's nest. if the old bird profited by this occasional habit, or if the young were made more vigorous by advantage having been taken of the mistaken maternal instinct of another bird, than by their own mother's care, encumbered as she can hardly fail to be by having eggs and young of different ages at the same time; then the old birds or the fostered young would gain an advantage. and analogy would lead me to believe, that the young thus reared would be apt to follow by inheritance the occasional and aberrant habit of their mother, and in their turn would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds' nests, and thus be successful in rearing their young. by a continued process of this nature, i believe that the strange instinct of our cuckoo could be, and has been, generated. i may add that, according to dr. gray and to some other observers, the european cuckoo has not utterly lost all maternal love and care for her own offspring. the occasional habit of birds laying their eggs in other birds' nests, either of the same or of a distinct species, is not very uncommon with the gallinaceae; and this perhaps explains the origin of a singular instinct in the allied group of ostriches. for several hen ostriches, at least in the case of the american species, unite and lay first a few eggs in one nest and then in another; and these are hatched by the males. this instinct may probably be accounted for by the fact of the hens laying a large number of eggs; but, as in the case of the cuckoo, at intervals of two or three days. this instinct, however, of the american ostrich has not as yet been perfected; for a surprising number of eggs lie strewed over the plains, so that in one day's hunting i picked up no less than twenty lost and wasted eggs. many bees are parasitic, and always lay their eggs in the nests of bees of other kinds. this case is more remarkable than that of the cuckoo; for these bees have not only their instincts but their structure modified in accordance with their parasitic habits; for they do not possess the pollen-collecting apparatus which would be necessary if they had to store food for their own young. some species, likewise, of sphegidae (wasp-like insects) are parasitic on other species; and m. fabre has lately shown good reason for believing that although the tachytes nigra generally makes its own burrow and stores it with paralysed prey for its own larvae to feed on, yet that when this insect finds a burrow already made and stored by another sphex, it takes advantage of the prize, and becomes for the occasion parasitic. in this case, as with the supposed case of the cuckoo, i can see no difficulty in natural selection making an occasional habit permanent, if of advantage to the species, and if the insect whose nest and stored food are thus feloniously appropriated, be not thus exterminated. slave-making instinct. this remarkable instinct was first discovered in the formica (polyerges) rufescens by pierre huber, a better observer even than his celebrated father. this ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves; without their aid, the species would certainly become extinct in a single year. the males and fertile females do no work. the workers or sterile females, though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves, do no other work. they are incapable of making their own nests, or of feeding their own larvae. when the old nest is found inconvenient, and they have to migrate, it is the slaves which determine the migration, and actually carry their masters in their jaws. so utterly helpless are the masters, that when huber shut up thirty of them without a slave, but with plenty of the food which they like best, and with their larvae and pupae to stimulate them to work, they did nothing; they could not even feed themselves, and many perished of hunger. huber then introduced a single slave (f. fusca), and she instantly set to work, fed and saved the survivors; made some cells and tended the larvae, and put all to rights. what can be more extraordinary than these well-ascertained facts? if we had not known of any other slave-making ant, it would have been hopeless to have speculated how so wonderful an instinct could have been perfected. formica sanguinea was likewise first discovered by p. huber to be a slave-making ant. this species is found in the southern parts of england, and its habits have been attended to by mr. f. smith, of the british museum, to whom i am much indebted for information on this and other subjects. although fully trusting to the statements of huber and mr. smith, i tried to approach the subject in a sceptical frame of mind, as any one may well be excused for doubting the truth of so extraordinary and odious an instinct as that of making slaves. hence i will give the observations which i have myself made, in some little detail. i opened fourteen nests of f. sanguinea, and found a few slaves in all. males and fertile females of the slave-species are found only in their own proper communities, and have never been observed in the nests of f. sanguinea. the slaves are black and not above half the size of their red masters, so that the contrast in their appearance is very great. when the nest is slightly disturbed, the slaves occasionally come out, and like their masters are much agitated and defend the nest: when the nest is much disturbed and the larvae and pupae are exposed, the slaves work energetically with their masters in carrying them away to a place of safety. hence, it is clear, that the slaves feel quite at home. during the months of june and july, on three successive years, i have watched for many hours several nests in surrey and sussex, and never saw a slave either leave or enter a nest. as, during these months, the slaves are very few in number, i thought that they might behave differently when more numerous; but mr. smith informs me that he has watched the nests at various hours during may, june and august, both in surrey and hampshire, and has never seen the slaves, though present in large numbers in august, either leave or enter the nest. hence he considers them as strictly household slaves. the masters, on the other hand, may be constantly seen bringing in materials for the nest, and food of all kinds. during the present year, however, in the month of july, i came across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves, and i observed a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest, and marching along the same road to a tall scotch-fir-tree, twenty-five yards distant, which they ascended together, probably in search of aphides or cocci. according to huber, who had ample opportunities for observation, in switzerland the slaves habitually work with their masters in making the nest, and they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening; and, as huber expressly states, their principal office is to search for aphides. this difference in the usual habits of the masters and slaves in the two countries, probably depends merely on the slaves being captured in greater numbers in switzerland than in england. one day i fortunately chanced to witness a migration from one nest to another, and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the masters carefully carrying, as huber has described, their slaves in their jaws. another day my attention was struck by about a score of the slave-makers haunting the same spot, and evidently not in search of food; they approached and were vigorously repulsed by an independent community of the slave species (f. fusca); sometimes as many as three of these ants clinging to the legs of the slave-making f. sanguinea. the latter ruthlessly killed their small opponents, and carried their dead bodies as food to their nest, twenty-nine yards distant; but they were prevented from getting any pupae to rear as slaves. i then dug up a small parcel of the pupae of f. fusca from another nest, and put them down on a bare spot near the place of combat; they were eagerly seized, and carried off by the tyrants, who perhaps fancied that, after all, they had been victorious in their late combat. at the same time i laid on the same place a small parcel of the pupae of another species, f. flava, with a few of these little yellow ants still clinging to the fragments of the nest. this species is sometimes, though rarely, made into slaves, as has been described by mr. smith. although so small a species, it is very courageous, and i have seen it ferociously attack other ants. in one instance i found to my surprise an independent community of f. flava under a stone beneath a nest of the slave-making f. sanguinea; and when i had accidentally disturbed both nests, the little ants attacked their big neighbours with surprising courage. now i was curious to ascertain whether f. sanguinea could distinguish the pupae of f. fusca, which they habitually make into slaves, from those of the little and furious f. flava, which they rarely capture, and it was evident that they did at once distinguish them: for we have seen that they eagerly and instantly seized the pupae of f. fusca, whereas they were much terrified when they came across the pupae, or even the earth from the nest of f. flava, and quickly ran away; but in about a quarter of an hour, shortly after all the little yellow ants had crawled away, they took heart and carried off the pupae. one evening i visited another community of f. sanguinea, and found a number of these ants entering their nest, carrying the dead bodies of f. fusca (showing that it was not a migration) and numerous pupae. i traced the returning file burthened with booty, for about forty yards, to a very thick clump of heath, whence i saw the last individual of f. sanguinea emerge, carrying a pupa; but i was not able to find the desolated nest in the thick heath. the nest, however, must have been close at hand, for two or three individuals of f. fusca were rushing about in the greatest agitation, and one was perched motionless with its own pupa in its mouth on the top of a spray of heath over its ravaged home. such are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in regard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves. let it be observed what a contrast the instinctive habits of f. sanguinea present with those of the f. rufescens. the latter does not build its own nest, does not determine its own migrations, does not collect food for itself or its young, and cannot even feed itself: it is absolutely dependent on its numerous slaves. formica sanguinea, on the other hand, possesses much fewer slaves, and in the early part of the summer extremely few. the masters determine when and where a new nest shall be formed, and when they migrate, the masters carry the slaves. both in switzerland and england the slaves seem to have the exclusive care of the larvae, and the masters alone go on slave-making expeditions. in switzerland the slaves and masters work together, making and bringing materials for the nest: both, but chiefly the slaves, tend, and milk as it may be called, their aphides; and thus both collect food for the community. in england the masters alone usually leave the nest to collect building materials and food for themselves, their slaves and larvae. so that the masters in this country receive much less service from their slaves than they do in switzerland. by what steps the instinct of f. sanguinea originated i will not pretend to conjecture. but as ants, which are not slave-makers, will, as i have seen, carry off pupae of other species, if scattered near their nests, it is possible that pupae originally stored as food might become developed; and the ants thus unintentionally reared would then follow their proper instincts, and do what work they could. if their presence proved useful to the species which had seized them--if it were more advantageous to this species to capture workers than to procreate them--the habit of collecting pupae originally for food might by natural selection be strengthened and rendered permanent for the very different purpose of raising slaves. when the instinct was once acquired, if carried out to a much less extent even than in our british f. sanguinea, which, as we have seen, is less aided by its slaves than the same species in switzerland, i can see no difficulty in natural selection increasing and modifying the instinct--always supposing each modification to be of use to the species--until an ant was formed as abjectly dependent on its slaves as is the formica rufescens. cell-making instinct of the hive-bee. i will not here enter on minute details on this subject, but will merely give an outline of the conclusions at which i have arrived. he must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a comb, so beautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration. we hear from mathematicians that bees have practically solved a recondite problem, and have made their cells of the proper shape to hold the greatest possible amount of honey, with the least possible consumption of precious wax in their construction. it has been remarked that a skilful workman, with fitting tools and measures, would find it very difficult to make cells of wax of the true form, though this is perfectly effected by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive. grant whatever instincts you please, and it seems at first quite inconceivable how they can make all the necessary angles and planes, or even perceive when they are correctly made. but the difficulty is not nearly so great as it at first appears: all this beautiful work can be shown, i think, to follow from a few very simple instincts. i was led to investigate this subject by mr. waterhouse, who has shown that the form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of adjoining cells; and the following view may, perhaps, be considered only as a modification of his theory. let us look to the great principle of gradation, and see whether nature does not reveal to us her method of work. at one end of a short series we have humble-bees, which use their old cocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax, and likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax. at the other end of the series we have the cells of the hive-bee, placed in a double layer: each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism, with the basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to join on to a pyramid, formed of three rhombs. these rhombs have certain angles, and the three which form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the comb, enter into the composition of the bases of three adjoining cells on the opposite side. in the series between the extreme perfection of the cells of the hive-bee and the simplicity of those of the humble-bee, we have the cells of the mexican melipona domestica, carefully described and figured by pierre huber. the melipona itself is intermediate in structure between the hive and humble bee, but more nearly related to the latter: it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells, in which the young are hatched, and, in addition, some large cells of wax for holding honey. these latter cells are nearly spherical and of nearly equal sizes, and are aggregated into an irregular mass. but the important point to notice, is that these cells are always made at that degree of nearness to each other, that they would have intersected or broken into each other, if the spheres had been completed; but this is never permitted, the bees building perfectly flat walls of wax between the spheres which thus tend to intersect. hence each cell consists of an outer spherical portion and of two, three, or more perfectly flat surfaces, according as the cell adjoins two, three or more other cells. when one cell comes into contact with three other cells, which, from the spheres being nearly of the same size, is very frequently and necessarily the case, the three flat surfaces are united into a pyramid; and this pyramid, as huber has remarked, is manifestly a gross imitation of the three-sided pyramidal basis of the cell of the hive-bee. as in the cells of the hive-bee, so here, the three plane surfaces in any one cell necessarily enter into the construction of three adjoining cells. it is obvious that the melipona saves wax by this manner of building; for the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double, but are of the same thickness as the outer spherical portions, and yet each flat portion forms a part of two cells. reflecting on this case, it occurred to me that if the melipona had made its spheres at some given distance from each other, and had made them of equal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer, the resulting structure would probably have been as perfect as the comb of the hive-bee. accordingly i wrote to professor miller, of cambridge, and this geometer has kindly read over the following statement, drawn up from his information, and tells me that it is strictly correct:-- if a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in two parallel layers; with the centre of each sphere at the distance of radius x the square root of 2 or radius x 1.41421 (or at some lesser distance), from the centres of the six surrounding spheres in the same layer; and at the same distance from the centres of the adjoining spheres in the other and parallel layer; then, if planes of intersection between the several spheres in both layers be formed, there will result a double layer of hexagonal prisms united together by pyramidal bases formed of three rhombs; and the rhombs and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will have every angle identically the same with the best measurements which have been made of the cells of the hive-bee. hence we may safely conclude that if we could slightly modify the instincts already possessed by the melipona, and in themselves not very wonderful, this bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as that of the hive-bee. we must suppose the melipona to make her cells truly spherical, and of equal sizes; and this would not be very surprising, seeing that she already does so to a certain extent, and seeing what perfectly cylindrical burrows in wood many insects can make, apparently by turning round on a fixed point. we must suppose the melipona to arrange her cells in level layers, as she already does her cylindrical cells; and we must further suppose, and this is the greatest difficulty, that she can somehow judge accurately at what distance to stand from her fellow-labourers when several are making their spheres; but she is already so far enabled to judge of distance, that she always describes her spheres so as to intersect largely; and then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly flat surfaces. we have further to suppose, but this is no difficulty, that after hexagonal prisms have been formed by the intersection of adjoining spheres in the same layer, she can prolong the hexagon to any length requisite to hold the stock of honey; in the same way as the rude humble-bee adds cylinders of wax to the circular mouths of her old cocoons. by such modifications of instincts in themselves not very wonderful,--hardly more wonderful than those which guide a bird to make its nest,--i believe that the hive-bee has acquired, through natural selection, her inimitable architectural powers. but this theory can be tested by experiment. following the example of mr. tegetmeier, i separated two combs, and put between them a long, thick, square strip of wax: the bees instantly began to excavate minute circular pits in it; and as they deepened these little pits, they made them wider and wider until they were converted into shallow basins, appearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere, and of about the diameter of a cell. it was most interesting to me to observe that wherever several bees had begun to excavate these basins near together, they had begun their work at such a distance from each other, that by the time the basins had acquired the above stated width (i.e. about the width of an ordinary cell), and were in depth about one sixth of the diameter of the sphere of which they formed a part, the rims of the basins intersected or broke into each other. as soon as this occurred, the bees ceased to excavate, and began to build up flat walls of wax on the lines of intersection between the basins, so that each hexagonal prism was built upon the festooned edge of a smooth basin, instead of on the straight edges of a three-sided pyramid as in the case of ordinary cells. i then put into the hive, instead of a thick, square piece of wax, a thin and narrow, knife-edged ridge, coloured with vermilion. the bees instantly began on both sides to excavate little basins near to each other, in the same way as before; but the ridge of wax was so thin, that the bottoms of the basins, if they had been excavated to the same depth as in the former experiment, would have broken into each other from the opposite sides. the bees, however, did not suffer this to happen, and they stopped their excavations in due time; so that the basins, as soon as they had been a little deepened, came to have flat bottoms; and these flat bottoms, formed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax having been left ungnawed, were situated, as far as the eye could judge, exactly along the planes of imaginary intersection between the basins on the opposite sides of the ridge of wax. in parts, only little bits, in other parts, large portions of a rhombic plate had been left between the opposed basins, but the work, from the unnatural state of things, had not been neatly performed. the bees must have worked at very nearly the same rate on the opposite sides of the ridge of vermilion wax, as they circularly gnawed away and deepened the basins on both sides, in order to have succeeded in thus leaving flat plates between the basins, by stopping work along the intermediate planes or planes of intersection. considering how flexible thin wax is, i do not see that there is any difficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a strip of wax, perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper thinness, and then stopping their work. in ordinary combs it has appeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working at exactly the same rate from the opposite sides; for i have noticed half-completed rhombs at the base of a just-commenced cell, which were slightly concave on one side, where i suppose that the bees had excavated too quickly, and convex on the opposed side, where the bees had worked less quickly. in one well-marked instance, i put the comb back into the hive, and allowed the bees to go on working for a short time, and again examined the cell, and i found that the rhombic plate had been completed, and had become perfectly flat: it was absolutely impossible, from the extreme thinness of the little rhombic plate, that they could have effected this by gnawing away the convex side; and i suspect that the bees in such cases stand in the opposed cells and push and bend the ductile and warm wax (which as i have tried is easily done) into its proper intermediate plane, and thus flatten it. from the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax, we can clearly see that if the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax, they could make their cells of the proper shape, by standing at the proper distance from each other, by excavating at the same rate, and by endeavouring to make equal spherical hollows, but never allowing the spheres to break into each other. now bees, as may be clearly seen by examining the edge of a growing comb, do make a rough, circumferential wall or rim all round the comb; and they gnaw into this from the opposite sides, always working circularly as they deepen each cell. they do not make the whole three-sided pyramidal base of any one cell at the same time, but only the one rhombic plate which stands on the extreme growing margin, or the two plates, as the case may be; and they never complete the upper edges of the rhombic plates, until the hexagonal walls are commenced. some of these statements differ from those made by the justly celebrated elder huber, but i am convinced of their accuracy; and if i had space, i could show that they are conformable with my theory. huber's statement that the very first cell is excavated out of a little parallel-sided wall of wax, is not, as far as i have seen, strictly correct; the first commencement having always been a little hood of wax; but i will not here enter on these details. we see how important a part excavation plays in the construction of the cells; but it would be a great error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax in the proper position--that is, along the plane of intersection between two adjoining spheres. i have several specimens showing clearly that they can do this. even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax round a growing comb, flexures may sometimes be observed, corresponding in position to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells. but the rough wall of wax has in every case to be finished off, by being largely gnawed away on both sides. the manner in which the bees build is curious; they always make the first rough wall from ten to twenty times thicker than the excessively thin finished wall of the cell, which will ultimately be left. we shall understand how they work, by supposing masons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement, and then to begin cutting it away equally on both sides near the ground, till a smooth, very thin wall is left in the middle; the masons always piling up the cut-away cement, and adding fresh cement, on the summit of the ridge. we shall thus have a thin wall steadily growing upward; but always crowned by a gigantic coping. from all the cells, both those just commenced and those completed, being thus crowned by a strong coping of wax, the bees can cluster and crawl over the comb without injuring the delicate hexagonal walls, which are only about one four-hundredth of an inch in thickness; the plates of the pyramidal basis being about twice as thick. by this singular manner of building, strength is continually given to the comb, with the utmost ultimate economy of wax. it seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the cells are made, that a multitude of bees all work together; one bee after working a short time at one cell going to another, so that, as huber has stated, a score of individuals work even at the commencement of the first cell. i was able practically to show this fact, by covering the edges of the hexagonal walls of a single cell, or the extreme margin of the circumferential rim of a growing comb, with an extremely thin layer of melted vermilion wax; and i invariably found that the colour was most delicately diffused by the bees--as delicately as a painter could have done with his brush--by atoms of the coloured wax having been taken from the spot on which it had been placed, and worked into the growing edges of the cells all round. the work of construction seems to be a sort of balance struck between many bees, all instinctively standing at the same relative distance from each other, all trying to sweep equal spheres, and then building up, or leaving ungnawed, the planes of intersection between these spheres. it was really curious to note in cases of difficulty, as when two pieces of comb met at an angle, how often the bees would entirely pull down and rebuild in different ways the same cell, sometimes recurring to a shape which they had at first rejected. when bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions for working,--for instance, on a slip of wood, placed directly under the middle of a comb growing downwards so that the comb has to be built over one face of the slip--in this case the bees can lay the foundations of one wall of a new hexagon, in its strictly proper place, projecting beyond the other completed cells. it suffices that the bees should be enabled to stand at their proper relative distances from each other and from the walls of the last completed cells, and then, by striking imaginary spheres, they can build up a wall intermediate between two adjoining spheres; but, as far as i have seen, they never gnaw away and finish off the angles of a cell till a large part both of that cell and of the adjoining cells has been built. this capacity in bees of laying down under certain circumstances a rough wall in its proper place between two just-commenced cells, is important, as it bears on a fact, which seems at first quite subversive of the foregoing theory; namely, that the cells on the extreme margin of wasp-combs are sometimes strictly hexagonal; but i have not space here to enter on this subject. nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a single insect (as in the case of a queen-wasp) making hexagonal cells, if she work alternately on the inside and outside of two or three cells commenced at the same time, always standing at the proper relative distance from the parts of the cells just begun, sweeping spheres or cylinders, and building up intermediate planes. it is even conceivable that an insect might, by fixing on a point at which to commence a cell, and then moving outside, first to one point, and then to five other points, at the proper relative distances from the central point and from each other, strike the planes of intersection, and so make an isolated hexagon: but i am not aware that any such case has been observed; nor would any good be derived from a single hexagon being built, as in its construction more materials would be required than for a cylinder. as natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight modifications of structure or instinct, each profitable to the individual under its conditions of life, it may reasonably be asked, how a long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts, all tending towards the present perfect plan of construction, could have profited the progenitors of the hive-bee? i think the answer is not difficult: it is known that bees are often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar; and i am informed by mr. tegetmeier that it has been experimentally found that no less than from twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are consumed by a hive of bees for the secretion of each pound of wax; so that a prodigious quantity of fluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in a hive for the secretion of the wax necessary for the construction of their combs. moreover, many bees have to remain idle for many days during the process of secretion. a large store of honey is indispensable to support a large stock of bees during the winter; and the security of the hive is known mainly to depend on a large number of bees being supported. hence the saving of wax by largely saving honey must be a most important element of success in any family of bees. of course the success of any species of bee may be dependent on the number of its parasites or other enemies, or on quite distinct causes, and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey which the bees could collect. but let us suppose that this latter circumstance determined, as it probably often does determine, the numbers of a humble-bee which could exist in a country; and let us further suppose that the community lived throughout the winter, and consequently required a store of honey: there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to our humble-bee, if a slight modification of her instinct led her to make her waxen cells near together, so as to intersect a little; for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells, would save some little wax. hence it would continually be more and more advantageous to our humble-bee, if she were to make her cells more and more regular, nearer together, and aggregated into a mass, like the cells of the melipona; for in this case a large part of the bounding surface of each cell would serve to bound other cells, and much wax would be saved. again, from the same cause, it would be advantageous to the melipona, if she were to make her cells closer together, and more regular in every way than at present; for then, as we have seen, the spherical surfaces would wholly disappear, and would all be replaced by plane surfaces; and the melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of the hive-bee. beyond this stage of perfection in architecture, natural selection could not lead; for the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can see, is absolutely perfect in economising wax. thus, as i believe, the most wonderful of all known instincts, that of the hive-bee, can be explained by natural selection having taken advantage of numerous, successive, slight modifications of simpler instincts; natural selection having by slow degrees, more and more perfectly, led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from each other in a double layer, and to build up and excavate the wax along the planes of intersection. the bees, of course, no more knowing that they swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other, than they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms and of the basal rhombic plates. the motive power of the process of natural selection having been economy of wax; that individual swarm which wasted least honey in the secretion of wax, having succeeded best, and having transmitted by inheritance its newly acquired economical instinct to new swarms, which in their turn will have had the best chance of succeeding in the struggle for existence. no doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed to the theory of natural selection,--cases, in which we cannot see how an instinct could possibly have originated; cases, in which no intermediate gradations are known to exist; cases of instinct of apparently such trifling importance, that they could hardly have been acted on by natural selection; cases of instincts almost identically the same in animals so remote in the scale of nature, that we cannot account for their similarity by inheritance from a common parent, and must therefore believe that they have been acquired by independent acts of natural selection. i will not here enter on these several cases, but will confine myself to one special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually fatal to my whole theory. i allude to the neuters or sterile females in insect-communities: for these neuters often differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the males and fertile females, and yet, from being sterile, they cannot propagate their kind. the subject well deserves to be discussed at great length, but i will here take only a single case, that of working or sterile ants. how the workers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty; but not much greater than that of any other striking modification of structure; for it can be shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a state of nature occasionally become sterile; and if such insects had been social, and it had been profitable to the community that a number should have been annually born capable of work, but incapable of procreation, i can see no very great difficulty in this being effected by natural selection. but i must pass over this preliminary difficulty. the great difficulty lies in the working ants differing widely from both the males and the fertile females in structure, as in the shape of the thorax and in being destitute of wings and sometimes of eyes, and in instinct. as far as instinct alone is concerned, the prodigious difference in this respect between the workers and the perfect females, would have been far better exemplified by the hive-bee. if a working ant or other neuter insect had been an animal in the ordinary state, i should have unhesitatingly assumed that all its characters had been slowly acquired through natural selection; namely, by an individual having been born with some slight profitable modification of structure, this being inherited by its offspring, which again varied and were again selected, and so onwards. but with the working ant we have an insect differing greatly from its parents, yet absolutely sterile; so that it could never have transmitted successively acquired modifications of structure or instinct to its progeny. it may well be asked how is it possible to reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection? first, let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances, both in our domestic productions and in those in a state of nature, of all sorts of differences of structure which have become correlated to certain ages, and to either sex. we have differences correlated not only to one sex, but to that short period alone when the reproductive system is active, as in the nuptial plumage of many birds, and in the hooked jaws of the male salmon. we have even slight differences in the horns of different breeds of cattle in relation to an artificially imperfect state of the male sex; for oxen of certain breeds have longer horns than in other breeds, in comparison with the horns of the bulls or cows of these same breeds. hence i can see no real difficulty in any character having become correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of insect-communities: the difficulty lies in understanding how such correlated modifications of structure could have been slowly accumulated by natural selection. this difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as i believe, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be applied to the family, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain the desired end. thus, a well-flavoured vegetable is cooked, and the individual is destroyed; but the horticulturist sows seeds of the same stock, and confidently expects to get nearly the same variety; breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well marbled together; the animal has been slaughtered, but the breeder goes with confidence to the same family. i have such faith in the powers of selection, that i do not doubt that a breed of cattle, always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns, could be slowly formed by carefully watching which individual bulls and cows, when matched, produced oxen with the longest horns; and yet no one ox could ever have propagated its kind. thus i believe it has been with social insects: a slight modification of structure, or instinct, correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of the community, has been advantageous to the community: consequently the fertile males and females of the same community flourished, and transmitted to their fertile offspring a tendency to produce sterile members having the same modification. and i believe that this process has been repeated, until that prodigious amount of difference between the fertile and sterile females of the same species has been produced, which we see in many social insects. but we have not as yet touched on the climax of the difficulty; namely, the fact that the neuters of several ants differ, not only from the fertile females and males, but from each other, sometimes to an almost incredible degree, and are thus divided into two or even three castes. the castes, moreover, do not generally graduate into each other, but are perfectly well defined; being as distinct from each other, as are any two species of the same genus, or rather as any two genera of the same family. thus in eciton, there are working and soldier neuters, with jaws and instincts extraordinarily different: in cryptocerus, the workers of one caste alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their heads, the use of which is quite unknown: in the mexican myrmecocystus, the workers of one caste never leave the nest; they are fed by the workers of another caste, and they have an enormously developed abdomen which secretes a sort of honey, supplying the place of that excreted by the aphides, or the domestic cattle as they may be called, which our european ants guard or imprison. it will indeed be thought that i have an overweening confidence in the principle of natural selection, when i do not admit that such wonderful and well-established facts at once annihilate my theory. in the simpler case of neuter insects all of one caste or of the same kind, which have been rendered by natural selection, as i believe to be quite possible, different from the fertile males and females,--in this case, we may safely conclude from the analogy of ordinary variations, that each successive, slight, profitable modification did not probably at first appear in all the individual neuters in the same nest, but in a few alone; and that by the long-continued selection of the fertile parents which produced most neuters with the profitable modification, all the neuters ultimately came to have the desired character. on this view we ought occasionally to find neuter-insects of the same species, in the same nest, presenting gradations of structure; and this we do find, even often, considering how few neuter-insects out of europe have been carefully examined. mr. f. smith has shown how surprisingly the neuters of several british ants differ from each other in size and sometimes in colour; and that the extreme forms can sometimes be perfectly linked together by individuals taken out of the same nest: i have myself compared perfect gradations of this kind. it often happens that the larger or the smaller sized workers are the most numerous; or that both large and small are numerous, with those of an intermediate size scanty in numbers. formica flava has larger and smaller workers, with some of intermediate size; and, in this species, as mr. f. smith has observed, the larger workers have simple eyes (ocelli), which though small can be plainly distinguished, whereas the smaller workers have their ocelli rudimentary. having carefully dissected several specimens of these workers, i can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the smaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their proportionally lesser size; and i fully believe, though i dare not assert so positively, that the workers of intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly intermediate condition. so that we here have two bodies of sterile workers in the same nest, differing not only in size, but in their organs of vision, yet connected by some few members in an intermediate condition. i may digress by adding, that if the smaller workers had been the most useful to the community, and those males and females had been continually selected, which produced more and more of the smaller workers, until all the workers had come to be in this condition; we should then have had a species of ant with neuters very nearly in the same condition with those of myrmica. for the workers of myrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli, though the male and female ants of this genus have well-developed ocelli. i may give one other case: so confidently did i expect to find gradations in important points of structure between the different castes of neuters in the same species, that i gladly availed myself of mr. f. smith's offer of numerous specimens from the same nest of the driver ant (anomma) of west africa. the reader will perhaps best appreciate the amount of difference in these workers, by my giving not the actual measurements, but a strictly accurate illustration: the difference was the same as if we were to see a set of workmen building a house of whom many were five feet four inches high, and many sixteen feet high; but we must suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead of three times as big as those of the smaller men, and jaws nearly five times as big. the jaws, moreover, of the working ants of the several sizes differed wonderfully in shape, and in the form and number of the teeth. but the important fact for us is, that though the workers can be grouped into castes of different sizes, yet they graduate insensibly into each other, as does the widely-different structure of their jaws. i speak confidently on this latter point, as mr. lubbock made drawings for me with the camera lucida of the jaws which i had dissected from the workers of the several sizes. with these facts before me, i believe that natural selection, by acting on the fertile parents, could form a species which should regularly produce neuters, either all of large size with one form of jaw, or all of small size with jaws having a widely different structure; or lastly, and this is our climax of difficulty, one set of workers of one size and structure, and simultaneously another set of workers of a different size and structure;--a graduated series having been first formed, as in the case of the driver ant, and then the extreme forms, from being the most useful to the community, having been produced in greater and greater numbers through the natural selection of the parents which generated them; until none with an intermediate structure were produced. thus, as i believe, the wonderful fact of two distinctly defined castes of sterile workers existing in the same nest, both widely different from each other and from their parents, has originated. we can see how useful their production may have been to a social community of insects, on the same principle that the division of labour is useful to civilised man. as ants work by inherited instincts and by inherited tools or weapons, and not by acquired knowledge and manufactured instruments, a perfect division of labour could be effected with them only by the workers being sterile; for had they been fertile, they would have intercrossed, and their instincts and structure would have become blended. and nature has, as i believe, effected this admirable division of labour in the communities of ants, by the means of natural selection. but i am bound to confess, that, with all my faith in this principle, i should never have anticipated that natural selection could have been efficient in so high a degree, had not the case of these neuter insects convinced me of the fact. i have, therefore, discussed this case, at some little but wholly insufficient length, in order to show the power of natural selection, and likewise because this is by far the most serious special difficulty, which my theory has encountered. the case, also, is very interesting, as it proves that with animals, as with plants, any amount of modification in structure can be effected by the accumulation of numerous, slight, and as we must call them accidental, variations, which are in any manner profitable, without exercise or habit having come into play. for no amount of exercise, or habit, or volition, in the utterly sterile members of a community could possibly have affected the structure or instincts of the fertile members, which alone leave descendants. i am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrative case of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of lamarck. summary. i have endeavoured briefly in this chapter to show that the mental qualities of our domestic animals vary, and that the variations are inherited. still more briefly i have attempted to show that instincts vary slightly in a state of nature. no one will dispute that instincts are of the highest importance to each animal. therefore i can see no difficulty, under changing conditions of life, in natural selection accumulating slight modifications of instinct to any extent, in any useful direction. in some cases habit or use and disuse have probably come into play. i do not pretend that the facts given in this chapter strengthen in any great degree my theory; but none of the cases of difficulty, to the best of my judgment, annihilate it. on the other hand, the fact that instincts are not always absolutely perfect and are liable to mistakes;--that no instinct has been produced for the exclusive good of other animals, but that each animal takes advantage of the instincts of others;--that the canon in natural history, of "natura non facit saltum" is applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal structure, and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views, but is otherwise inexplicable,--all tend to corroborate the theory of natural selection. this theory is, also, strengthened by some few other facts in regard to instincts; as by that common case of closely allied, but certainly distinct, species, when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living under considerably different conditions of life, yet often retaining nearly the same instincts. for instance, we can understand on the principle of inheritance, how it is that the thrush of south america lines its nest with mud, in the same peculiar manner as does our british thrush: how it is that the male wrens (troglodytes) of north america, build "cock-nests," to roost in, like the males of our distinct kitty-wrens,--a habit wholly unlike that of any other known bird. finally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers,--ants making slaves,--the larvae of ichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars,--not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die. 8. hybridism. distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. sterility various in degree, not universal, affected by close interbreeding, removed by domestication. laws governing the sterility of hybrids. sterility not a special endowment, but incidental on other differences. causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. parallelism between the effects of changed conditions of life and crossing. fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel offspring not universal. hybrids and mongrels compared independently of their fertility. summary. the view generally entertained by naturalists is that species, when intercrossed, have been specially endowed with the quality of sterility, in order to prevent the confusion of all organic forms. this view certainly seems at first probable, for species within the same country could hardly have kept distinct had they been capable of crossing freely. the importance of the fact that hybrids are very generally sterile, has, i think, been much underrated by some late writers. on the theory of natural selection the case is especially important, inasmuch as the sterility of hybrids could not possibly be of any advantage to them, and therefore could not have been acquired by the continued preservation of successive profitable degrees of sterility. i hope, however, to be able to show that sterility is not a specially acquired or endowed quality, but is incidental on other acquired differences. in treating this subject, two classes of facts, to a large extent fundamentally different, have generally been confounded together; namely, the sterility of two species when first crossed, and the sterility of the hybrids produced from them. pure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfect condition, yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no offspring. hybrids, on the other hand, have their reproductive organs functionally impotent, as may be clearly seen in the state of the male element in both plants and animals; though the organs themselves are perfect in structure, as far as the microscope reveals. in the first case the two sexual elements which go to form the embryo are perfect; in the second case they are either not at all developed, or are imperfectly developed. this distinction is important, when the cause of the sterility, which is common to the two cases, has to be considered. the distinction has probably been slurred over, owing to the sterility in both cases being looked on as a special endowment, beyond the province of our reasoning powers. the fertility of varieties, that is of the forms known or believed to have descended from common parents, when intercrossed, and likewise the fertility of their mongrel offspring, is, on my theory, of equal importance with the sterility of species; for it seems to make a broad and clear distinction between varieties and species. first, for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid offspring. it is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of those two conscientious and admirable observers, kolreuter and gartner, who almost devoted their lives to this subject, without being deeply impressed with the high generality of some degree of sterility. kolreuter makes the rule universal; but then he cuts the knot, for in ten cases in which he found two forms, considered by most authors as distinct species, quite fertile together, he unhesitatingly ranks them as varieties. gartner, also, makes the rule equally universal; and he disputes the entire fertility of kolreuter's ten cases. but in these and in many other cases, gartner is obliged carefully to count the seeds, in order to show that there is any degree of sterility. he always compares the maximum number of seeds produced by two species when crossed and by their hybrid offspring, with the average number produced by both pure parent-species in a state of nature. but a serious cause of error seems to me to be here introduced: a plant to be hybridised must be castrated, and, what is often more important, must be secluded in order to prevent pollen being brought to it by insects from other plants. nearly all the plants experimentised on by gartner were potted, and apparently were kept in a chamber in his house. that these processes are often injurious to the fertility of a plant cannot be doubted; for gartner gives in his table about a score of cases of plants which he castrated, and artificially fertilised with their own pollen, and (excluding all cases such as the leguminosae, in which there is an acknowledged difficulty in the manipulation) half of these twenty plants had their fertility in some degree impaired. moreover, as gartner during several years repeatedly crossed the primrose and cowslip, which we have such good reason to believe to be varieties, and only once or twice succeeded in getting fertile seed; as he found the common red and blue pimpernels (anagallis arvensis and coerulea), which the best botanists rank as varieties, absolutely sterile together; and as he came to the same conclusion in several other analogous cases; it seems to me that we may well be permitted to doubt whether many other species are really so sterile, when intercrossed, as gartner believes. it is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various species when crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly, and, on the other hand, that the fertility of pure species is so easily affected by various circumstances, that for all practical purposes it is most difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins. i think no better evidence of this can be required than that the two most experienced observers who have ever lived, namely, kolreuter and gartner, should have arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to the very same species. it is also most instructive to compare--but i have not space here to enter on details--the evidence advanced by our best botanists on the question whether certain doubtful forms should be ranked as species or varieties, with the evidence from fertility adduced by different hybridisers, or by the same author, from experiments made during different years. it can thus be shown that neither sterility nor fertility affords any clear distinction between species and varieties; but that the evidence from this source graduates away, and is doubtful in the same degree as is the evidence derived from other constitutional and structural differences. in regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations; though gartner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully guarding them from a cross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in one case for ten generations, yet he asserts positively that their fertility never increased, but generally greatly decreased. i do not doubt that this is usually the case, and that the fertility often suddenly decreases in the first few generations. nevertheless i believe that in all these experiments the fertility has been diminished by an independent cause, namely, from close interbreeding. i have collected so large a body of facts, showing that close interbreeding lessens fertility, and, on the other hand, that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety increases fertility, that i cannot doubt the correctness of this almost universal belief amongst breeders. hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers; and as the parent-species, or other allied hybrids, generally grow in the same garden, the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the flowering season: hence hybrids will generally be fertilised during each generation by their own individual pollen; and i am convinced that this would be injurious to their fertility, already lessened by their hybrid origin. i am strengthened in this conviction by a remarkable statement repeatedly made by gartner, namely, that if even the less fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same kind, their fertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill effects of manipulation, sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on increasing. now, in artificial fertilisation pollen is as often taken by chance (as i know from my own experience) from the anthers of another flower, as from the anthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised; so that a cross between two flowers, though probably on the same plant, would be thus effected. moreover, whenever complicated experiments are in progress, so careful an observer as gartner would have castrated his hybrids, and this would have insured in each generation a cross with the pollen from a distinct flower, either from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid nature. and thus, the strange fact of the increase of fertility in the successive generations of artificially fertilised hybrids may, i believe, be accounted for by close interbreeding having been avoided. now let us turn to the results arrived at by the third most experienced hybridiser, namely, the honourable and reverend w. herbert. he is as emphatic in his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertile--as fertile as the pure parent-species--as are kolreuter and gartner that some degree of sterility between distinct species is a universal law of nature. he experimentised on some of the very same species as did gartner. the difference in their results may, i think, be in part accounted for by herbert's great horticultural skill, and by his having hothouses at his command. of his many important statements i will here give only a single one as an example, namely, that "every ovule in a pod of crinum capense fertilised by c. revolutum produced a plant, which (he says) i never saw to occur in a case of its natural fecundation." so that we here have perfect, or even more than commonly perfect, fertility in a first cross between two distinct species. this case of the crinum leads me to refer to a most singular fact, namely, that there are individual plants, as with certain species of lobelia, and with all the species of the genus hippeastrum, which can be far more easily fertilised by the pollen of another and distinct species, than by their own pollen. for these plants have been found to yield seed to the pollen of a distinct species, though quite sterile with their own pollen, notwithstanding that their own pollen was found to be perfectly good, for it fertilised distinct species. so that certain individual plants and all the individuals of certain species can actually be hybridised much more readily than they can be self-fertilised! for instance, a bulb of hippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers; three were fertilised by herbert with their own pollen, and the fourth was subsequently fertilised by the pollen of a compound hybrid descended from three other and distinct species: the result was that "the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to grow, and after a few days perished entirely, whereas the pod impregnated by the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid progress to maturity, and bore good seed, which vegetated freely." in a letter to me, in 1839, mr. herbert told me that he had then tried the experiment during five years, and he continued to try it during several subsequent years, and always with the same result. this result has, also, been confirmed by other observers in the case of hippeastrum with its sub-genera, and in the case of some other genera, as lobelia, passiflora and verbascum. although the plants in these experiments appeared perfectly healthy, and although both the ovules and pollen of the same flower were perfectly good with respect to other species, yet as they were functionally imperfect in their mutual self-action, we must infer that the plants were in an unnatural state. nevertheless these facts show on what slight and mysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of species when crossed, in comparison with the same species when self-fertilised, sometimes depends. the practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made with scientific precision, deserve some notice. it is notorious in how complicated a manner the species of pelargonium, fuchsia, calceolaria, petunia, rhododendron, etc., have been crossed, yet many of these hybrids seed freely. for instance, herbert asserts that a hybrid from calceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea, species most widely dissimilar in general habit, "reproduced itself as perfectly as if it had been a natural species from the mountains of chile." i have taken some pains to ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the complex crosses of rhododendrons, and i am assured that many of them are perfectly fertile. mr. c. noble, for instance, informs me that he raises stocks for grafting from a hybrid between rhododendron ponticum and catawbiense, and that this hybrid "seeds as freely as it is possible to imagine." had hybrids, when fairly treated, gone on decreasing in fertility in each successive generation, as gartner believes to be the case, the fact would have been notorious to nurserymen. horticulturists raise large beds of the same hybrids, and such alone are fairly treated, for by insect agency the several individuals of the same hybrid variety are allowed to freely cross with each other, and the injurious influence of close interbreeding is thus prevented. any one may readily convince himself of the efficiency of insect-agency by examining the flowers of the more sterile kinds of hybrid rhododendrons, which produce no pollen, for he will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen brought from other flowers. in regard to animals, much fewer experiments have been carefully tried than with plants. if our systematic arrangements can be trusted, that is if the genera of animals are as distinct from each other, as are the genera of plants, then we may infer that animals more widely separated in the scale of nature can be more easily crossed than in the case of plants; but the hybrids themselves are, i think, more sterile. i doubt whether any case of a perfectly fertile hybrid animal can be considered as thoroughly well authenticated. it should, however, be borne in mind that, owing to few animals breeding freely under confinement, few experiments have been fairly tried: for instance, the canary-bird has been crossed with nine other finches, but as not one of these nine species breeds freely in confinement, we have no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the canary, or that their hybrids, should be perfectly fertile. again, with respect to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile hybrid animals, i hardly know of an instance in which two families of the same hybrid have been raised at the same time from different parents, so as to avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding. on the contrary, brothers and sisters have usually been crossed in each successive generation, in opposition to the constantly repeated admonition of every breeder. and in this case, it is not at all surprising that the inherent sterility in the hybrids should have gone on increasing. if we were to act thus, and pair brothers and sisters in the case of any pure animal, which from any cause had the least tendency to sterility, the breed would assuredly be lost in a very few generations. although i do not know of any thoroughly well-authenticated cases of perfectly fertile hybrid animals, i have some reason to believe that the hybrids from cervulus vaginalis and reevesii, and from phasianus colchicus with p. torquatus and with p. versicolor are perfectly fertile. the hybrids from the common and chinese geese (a. cygnoides), species which are so different that they are generally ranked in distinct genera, have often bred in this country with either pure parent, and in one single instance they have bred inter se. this was effected by mr. eyton, who raised two hybrids from the same parents but from different hatches; and from these two birds he raised no less than eight hybrids (grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest. in india, however, these cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for i am assured by two eminently capable judges, namely mr. blyth and capt. hutton, that whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various parts of the country; and as they are kept for profit, where neither pure parent-species exists, they must certainly be highly fertile. a doctrine which originated with pallas, has been largely accepted by modern naturalists; namely, that most of our domestic animals have descended from two or more aboriginal species, since commingled by intercrossing. on this view, the aboriginal species must either at first have produced quite fertile hybrids, or the hybrids must have become in subsequent generations quite fertile under domestication. this latter alternative seems to me the most probable, and i am inclined to believe in its truth, although it rests on no direct evidence. i believe, for instance, that our dogs have descended from several wild stocks; yet, with perhaps the exception of certain indigenous domestic dogs of south america, all are quite fertile together; and analogy makes me greatly doubt, whether the several aboriginal species would at first have freely bred together and have produced quite fertile hybrids. so again there is reason to believe that our european and the humped indian cattle are quite fertile together; but from facts communicated to me by mr. blyth, i think they must be considered as distinct species. on this view of the origin of many of our domestic animals, we must either give up the belief of the almost universal sterility of distinct species of animals when crossed; or we must look at sterility, not as an indelible characteristic, but as one capable of being removed by domestication. finally, looking to all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of plants and animals, it may be concluded that some degree of sterility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is an extremely general result; but that it cannot, under our present state of knowledge, be considered as absolutely universal. laws governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. we will now consider a little more in detail the circumstances and rules governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. our chief object will be to see whether or not the rules indicate that species have specially been endowed with this quality, in order to prevent their crossing and blending together in utter confusion. the following rules and conclusions are chiefly drawn up from gartner's admirable work on the hybridisation of plants. i have taken much pains to ascertain how far the rules apply to animals, and considering how scanty our knowledge is in regard to hybrid animals, i have been surprised to find how generally the same rules apply to both kingdoms. it has been already remarked, that the degree of fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, graduates from zero to perfect fertility. it is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown to exist; but only the barest outline of the facts can here be given. when pollen from a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of a distinct family, it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic dust. from this absolute zero of fertility, the pollen of different species of the same genus applied to the stigma of some one species, yields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds produced, up to nearly complete or even quite complete fertility; and, as we have seen, in certain abnormal cases, even to an excess of fertility, beyond that which the plant's own pollen will produce. so in hybrids themselves, there are some which never have produced, and probably never would produce, even with the pollen of either pure parent, a single fertile seed: but in some of these cases a first trace of fertility may be detected, by the pollen of one of the pure parent-species causing the flower of the hybrid to wither earlier than it otherwise would have done; and the early withering of the flower is well known to be a sign of incipient fertilisation. from this extreme degree of sterility we have self-fertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater number of seeds up to perfect fertility. hybrids from two species which are very difficult to cross, and which rarely produce any offspring, are generally very sterile; but the parallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross, and the sterility of the hybrids thus produced--two classes of facts which are generally confounded together--is by no means strict. there are many cases, in which two pure species can be united with unusual facility, and produce numerous hybrid-offspring, yet these hybrids are remarkably sterile. on the other hand, there are species which can be crossed very rarely, or with extreme difficulty, but the hybrids, when at last produced, are very fertile. even within the limits of the same genus, for instance in dianthus, these two opposite cases occur. the fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is more easily affected by unfavourable conditions, than is the fertility of pure species. but the degree of fertility is likewise innately variable; for it is not always the same when the same two species are crossed under the same circumstances, but depends in part upon the constitution of the individuals which happen to have been chosen for the experiment. so it is with hybrids, for their degree of fertility is often found to differ greatly in the several individuals raised from seed out of the same capsule and exposed to exactly the same conditions. by the term systematic affinity is meant, the resemblance between species in structure and in constitution, more especially in the structure of parts which are of high physiological importance and which differ little in the allied species. now the fertility of first crosses between species, and of the hybrids produced from them, is largely governed by their systematic affinity. this is clearly shown by hybrids never having been raised between species ranked by systematists in distinct families; and on the other hand, by very closely allied species generally uniting with facility. but the correspondence between systematic affinity and the facility of crossing is by no means strict. a multitude of cases could be given of very closely allied species which will not unite, or only with extreme difficulty; and on the other hand of very distinct species which unite with the utmost facility. in the same family there may be a genus, as dianthus, in which very many species can most readily be crossed; and another genus, as silene, in which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce between extremely close species a single hybrid. even within the limits of the same genus, we meet with this same difference; for instance, the many species of nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of almost any other genus; but gartner found that n. acuminata, which is not a particularly distinct species, obstinately failed to fertilise, or to be fertilised by, no less than eight other species of nicotiana. very many analogous facts could be given. no one has been able to point out what kind, or what amount, of difference in any recognisable character is sufficient to prevent two species crossing. it can be shown that plants most widely different in habit and general appearance, and having strongly marked differences in every part of the flower, even in the pollen, in the fruit, and in the cotyledons, can be crossed. annual and perennial plants, deciduous and evergreen trees, plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for extremely different climates, can often be crossed with ease. by a reciprocal cross between two species, i mean the case, for instance, of a stallion-horse being first crossed with a female-ass, and then a male-ass with a mare: these two species may then be said to have been reciprocally crossed. there is often the widest possible difference in the facility of making reciprocal crosses. such cases are highly important, for they prove that the capacity in any two species to cross is often completely independent of their systematic affinity, or of any recognisable difference in their whole organisation. on the other hand, these cases clearly show that the capacity for crossing is connected with constitutional differences imperceptible by us, and confined to the reproductive system. this difference in the result of reciprocal crosses between the same two species was long ago observed by kolreuter. to give an instance: mirabilis jalappa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of m. longiflora, and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile; but kolreuter tried more than two hundred times, during eight following years, to fertilise reciprocally m. longiflora with the pollen of m. jalappa, and utterly failed. several other equally striking cases could be given. thuret has observed the same fact with certain sea-weeds or fuci. gartner, moreover, found that this difference of facility in making reciprocal crosses is extremely common in a lesser degree. he has observed it even between forms so closely related (as matthiola annua and glabra) that many botanists rank them only as varieties. it is also a remarkable fact, that hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses, though of course compounded of the very same two species, the one species having first been used as the father and then as the mother, generally differ in fertility in a small, and occasionally in a high degree. several other singular rules could be given from gartner: for instance, some species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species; other species of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing their likeness on their hybrid offspring; but these two powers do not at all necessarily go together. there are certain hybrids which instead of having, as is usual, an intermediate character between their two parents, always closely resemble one of them; and such hybrids, though externally so like one of their pure parent-species, are with rare exceptions extremely sterile. so again amongst hybrids which are usually intermediate in structure between their parents, exceptional and abnormal individuals sometimes are born, which closely resemble one of their pure parents; and these hybrids are almost always utterly sterile, even when the other hybrids raised from seed from the same capsule have a considerable degree of fertility. these facts show how completely fertility in the hybrid is independent of its external resemblance to either pure parent. considering the several rules now given, which govern the fertility of first crosses and of hybrids, we see that when forms, which must be considered as good and distinct species, are united, their fertility graduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even to fertility under certain conditions in excess. that their fertility, besides being eminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions, is innately variable. that it is by no means always the same in degree in the first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross. that the fertility of hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble in external appearance either parent. and lastly, that the facility of making a first cross between any two species is not always governed by their systematic affinity or degree of resemblance to each other. this latter statement is clearly proved by reciprocal crosses between the same two species, for according as the one species or the other is used as the father or the mother, there is generally some difference, and occasionally the widest possible difference, in the facility of effecting an union. the hybrids, moreover, produced from reciprocal crosses often differ in fertility. now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been endowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded in nature? i think not. for why should the sterility be so extremely different in degree, when various species are crossed, all of which we must suppose it would be equally important to keep from blending together? why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in the individuals of the same species? why should some species cross with facility, and yet produce very sterile hybrids; and other species cross with extreme difficulty, and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids? why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species? why, it may even be asked, has the production of hybrids been permitted? to grant to species the special power of producing hybrids, and then to stop their further propagation by different degrees of sterility, not strictly related to the facility of the first union between their parents, seems to be a strange arrangement. the foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear to me clearly to indicate that the sterility both of first crosses and of hybrids is simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences, chiefly in the reproductive systems, of the species which are crossed. the differences being of so peculiar and limited a nature, that, in reciprocal crosses between two species the male sexual element of the one will often freely act on the female sexual element of the other, but not in a reversed direction. it will be advisable to explain a little more fully by an example what i mean by sterility being incidental on other differences, and not a specially endowed quality. as the capacity of one plant to be grafted or budded on another is so entirely unimportant for its welfare in a state of nature, i presume that no one will suppose that this capacity is a specially endowed quality, but will admit that it is incidental on differences in the laws of growth of the two plants. we can sometimes see the reason why one tree will not take on another, from differences in their rate of growth, in the hardness of their wood, in the period of the flow or nature of their sap, etc.; but in a multitude of cases we can assign no reason whatever. great diversity in the size of two plants, one being woody and the other herbaceous, one being evergreen and the other deciduous, and adaptation to widely different climates, does not always prevent the two grafting together. as in hybridisation, so with grafting, the capacity is limited by systematic affinity, for no one has been able to graft trees together belonging to quite distinct families; and, on the other hand, closely allied species, and varieties of the same species, can usually, but not invariably, be grafted with ease. but this capacity, as in hybridisation, is by no means absolutely governed by systematic affinity. although many distinct genera within the same family have been grafted together, in other cases species of the same genus will not take on each other. the pear can be grafted far more readily on the quince, which is ranked as a distinct genus, than on the apple, which is a member of the same genus. even different varieties of the pear take with different degrees of facility on the quince; so do different varieties of the apricot and peach on certain varieties of the plum. as gartner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in different individuals of the same two species in crossing; so sagaret believes this to be the case with different individuals of the same two species in being grafted together. as in reciprocal crosses, the facility of effecting an union is often very far from equal, so it sometimes is in grafting; the common gooseberry, for instance, cannot be grafted on the currant, whereas the currant will take, though with difficulty, on the gooseberry. we have seen that the sterility of hybrids, which have their reproductive organs in an imperfect condition, is a very different case from the difficulty of uniting two pure species, which have their reproductive organs perfect; yet these two distinct cases run to a certain extent parallel. something analogous occurs in grafting; for thouin found that three species of robinia, which seeded freely on their own roots, and which could be grafted with no great difficulty on another species, when thus grafted were rendered barren. on the other hand, certain species of sorbus, when grafted on other species, yielded twice as much fruit as when on their own roots. we are reminded by this latter fact of the extraordinary case of hippeastrum, lobelia, etc., which seeded much more freely when fertilised with the pollen of distinct species, than when self-fertilised with their own pollen. we thus see, that although there is a clear and fundamental difference between the mere adhesion of grafted stocks, and the union of the male and female elements in the act of reproduction, yet that there is a rude degree of parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing distinct species. and as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the facility with which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on unknown differences in their vegetative systems, so i believe that the still more complex laws governing the facility of first crosses, are incidental on unknown differences, chiefly in their reproductive systems. these differences, in both cases, follow to a certain extent, as might have been expected, systematic affinity, by which every kind of resemblance and dissimilarity between organic beings is attempted to be expressed. the facts by no means seem to me to indicate that the greater or lesser difficulty of either grafting or crossing together various species has been a special endowment; although in the case of crossing, the difficulty is as important for the endurance and stability of specific forms, as in the case of grafting it is unimportant for their welfare. causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. we may now look a little closer at the probable causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. these two cases are fundamentally different, for, as just remarked, in the union of two pure species the male and female sexual elements are perfect, whereas in hybrids they are imperfect. even in first crosses, the greater or lesser difficulty in effecting a union apparently depends on several distinct causes. there must sometimes be a physical impossibility in the male element reaching the ovule, as would be the case with a plant having a pistil too long for the pollen-tubes to reach the ovarium. it has also been observed that when pollen of one species is placed on the stigma of a distantly allied species, though the pollen-tubes protrude, they do not penetrate the stigmatic surface. again, the male element may reach the female element, but be incapable of causing an embryo to be developed, as seems to have been the case with some of thuret's experiments on fuci. no explanation can be given of these facts, any more than why certain trees cannot be grafted on others. lastly, an embryo may be developed, and then perish at an early period. this latter alternative has not been sufficiently attended to; but i believe, from observations communicated to me by mr. hewitt, who has had great experience in hybridising gallinaceous birds, that the early death of the embryo is a very frequent cause of sterility in first crosses. i was at first very unwilling to believe in this view; as hybrids, when once born, are generally healthy and long-lived, as we see in the case of the common mule. hybrids, however, are differently circumstanced before and after birth: when born and living in a country where their two parents can live, they are generally placed under suitable conditions of life. but a hybrid partakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its mother, and therefore before birth, as long as it is nourished within its mother's womb or within the egg or seed produced by the mother, it may be exposed to conditions in some degree unsuitable, and consequently be liable to perish at an early period; more especially as all very young beings seem eminently sensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life. in regard to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual elements are imperfectly developed, the case is very different. i have more than once alluded to a large body of facts, which i have collected, showing that when animals and plants are removed from their natural conditions, they are extremely liable to have their reproductive systems seriously affected. this, in fact, is the great bar to the domestication of animals. between the sterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids, there are many points of similarity. in both cases the sterility is independent of general health, and is often accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance. in both cases, the sterility occurs in various degrees; in both, the male element is the most liable to be affected; but sometimes the female more than the male. in both, the tendency goes to a certain extent with systematic affinity, for whole groups of animals and plants are rendered impotent by the same unnatural conditions; and whole groups of species tend to produce sterile hybrids. on the other hand, one species in a group will sometimes resist great changes of conditions with unimpaired fertility; and certain species in a group will produce unusually fertile hybrids. no one can tell, till he tries, whether any particular animal will breed under confinement or any plant seed freely under culture; nor can he tell, till he tries, whether any two species of a genus will produce more or less sterile hybrids. lastly, when organic beings are placed during several generations under conditions not natural to them, they are extremely liable to vary, which is due, as i believe, to their reproductive systems having been specially affected, though in a lesser degree than when sterility ensues. so it is with hybrids, for hybrids in successive generations are eminently liable to vary, as every experimentalist has observed. thus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural conditions, and when hybrids are produced by the unnatural crossing of two species, the reproductive system, independently of the general state of health, is affected by sterility in a very similar manner. in the one case, the conditions of life have been disturbed, though often in so slight a degree as to be inappreciable by us; in the other case, or that of hybrids, the external conditions have remained the same, but the organisation has been disturbed by two different structures and constitutions having been blended into one. for it is scarcely possible that two organisations should be compounded into one, without some disturbance occurring in the development, or periodical action, or mutual relation of the different parts and organs one to another, or to the conditions of life. when hybrids are able to breed inter se, they transmit to their offspring from generation to generation the same compounded organisation, and hence we need not be surprised that their sterility, though in some degree variable, rarely diminishes. it must, however, be confessed that we cannot understand, excepting on vague hypotheses, several facts with respect to the sterility of hybrids; for instance, the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from reciprocal crosses; or the increased sterility in those hybrids which occasionally and exceptionally resemble closely either pure parent. nor do i pretend that the foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter: no explanation is offered why an organism, when placed under unnatural conditions, is rendered sterile. all that i have attempted to show, is that in two cases, in some respects allied, sterility is the common result,--in the one case from the conditions of life having been disturbed, in the other case from the organisation having been disturbed by two organisations having been compounded into one. it may seem fanciful, but i suspect that a similar parallelism extends to an allied yet very different class of facts. it is an old and almost universal belief, founded, i think, on a considerable body of evidence, that slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to all living things. we see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their frequent exchanges of seed, tubers, etc., from one soil or climate to another, and back again. during the convalescence of animals, we plainly see that great benefit is derived from almost any change in the habits of life. again, both with plants and animals, there is abundant evidence, that a cross between very distinct individuals of the same species, that is between members of different strains or sub-breeds, gives vigour and fertility to the offspring. i believe, indeed, from the facts alluded to in our fourth chapter, that a certain amount of crossing is indispensable even with hermaphrodites; and that close interbreeding continued during several generations between the nearest relations, especially if these be kept under the same conditions of life, always induces weakness and sterility in the progeny. hence it seems that, on the one hand, slight changes in the conditions of life benefit all organic beings, and on the other hand, that slight crosses, that is crosses between the males and females of the same species which have varied and become slightly different, give vigour and fertility to the offspring. but we have seen that greater changes, or changes of a particular nature, often render organic beings in some degree sterile; and that greater crosses, that is crosses between males and females which have become widely or specifically different, produce hybrids which are generally sterile in some degree. i cannot persuade myself that this parallelism is an accident or an illusion. both series of facts seem to be connected together by some common but unknown bond, which is essentially related to the principle of life. fertility of varieties when crossed, and of their mongrel offspring. it may be urged, as a most forcible argument, that there must be some essential distinction between species and varieties, and that there must be some error in all the foregoing remarks, inasmuch as varieties, however much they may differ from each other in external appearance, cross with perfect facility, and yield perfectly fertile offspring. i fully admit that this is almost invariably the case. but if we look to varieties produced under nature, we are immediately involved in hopeless difficulties; for if two hitherto reputed varieties be found in any degree sterile together, they are at once ranked by most naturalists as species. for instance, the blue and red pimpernel, the primrose and cowslip, which are considered by many of our best botanists as varieties, are said by gartner not to be quite fertile when crossed, and he consequently ranks them as undoubted species. if we thus argue in a circle, the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will assuredly have to be granted. if we turn to varieties, produced, or supposed to have been produced, under domestication, we are still involved in doubt. for when it is stated, for instance, that the german spitz dog unites more easily than other dogs with foxes, or that certain south american indigenous domestic dogs do not readily cross with european dogs, the explanation which will occur to everyone, and probably the true one, is that these dogs have descended from several aboriginally distinct species. nevertheless the perfect fertility of so many domestic varieties, differing widely from each other in appearance, for instance of the pigeon or of the cabbage, is a remarkable fact; more especially when we reflect how many species there are, which, though resembling each other most closely, are utterly sterile when intercrossed. several considerations, however, render the fertility of domestic varieties less remarkable than at first appears. it can, in the first place, be clearly shown that mere external dissimilarity between two species does not determine their greater or lesser degree of sterility when crossed; and we may apply the same rule to domestic varieties. in the second place, some eminent naturalists believe that a long course of domestication tends to eliminate sterility in the successive generations of hybrids, which were at first only slightly sterile; and if this be so, we surely ought not to expect to find sterility both appearing and disappearing under nearly the same conditions of life. lastly, and this seems to me by far the most important consideration, new races of animals and plants are produced under domestication by man's methodical and unconscious power of selection, for his own use and pleasure: he neither wishes to select, nor could select, slight differences in the reproductive system, or other constitutional differences correlated with the reproductive system. he supplies his several varieties with the same food; treats them in nearly the same manner, and does not wish to alter their general habits of life. nature acts uniformly and slowly during vast periods of time on the whole organisation, in any way which may be for each creature's own good; and thus she may, either directly, or more probably indirectly, through correlation, modify the reproductive system in the several descendants from any one species. seeing this difference in the process of selection, as carried on by man and nature, we need not be surprised at some difference in the result. i have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species were invariably fertile when intercrossed. but it seems to me impossible to resist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in the few following cases, which i will briefly abstract. the evidence is at least as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of a multitude of species. the evidence is, also, derived from hostile witnesses, who in all other cases consider fertility and sterility as safe criterions of specific distinction. gartner kept during several years a dwarf kind of maize with yellow seeds, and a tall variety with red seeds, growing near each other in his garden; and although these plants have separated sexes, they never naturally crossed. he then fertilised thirteen flowers of the one with the pollen of the other; but only a single head produced any seed, and this one head produced only five grains. manipulation in this case could not have been injurious, as the plants have separated sexes. no one, i believe, has suspected that these varieties of maize are distinct species; and it is important to notice that the hybrid plants thus raised were themselves perfectly fertile; so that even gartner did not venture to consider the two varieties as specifically distinct. girou de buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd, which like the maize has separated sexes, and he asserts that their mutual fertilisation is by so much the less easy as their differences are greater. how far these experiments may be trusted, i know not; but the forms experimentised on, are ranked by sagaret, who mainly founds his classification by the test of infertility, as varieties. the following case is far more remarkable, and seems at first quite incredible; but it is the result of an astonishing number of experiments made during many years on nine species of verbascum, by so good an observer and so hostile a witness, as gartner: namely, that yellow and white varieties of the same species of verbascum when intercrossed produce less seed, than do either coloured varieties when fertilised with pollen from their own coloured flowers. moreover, he asserts that when yellow and white varieties of one species are crossed with yellow and white varieties of a distinct species, more seed is produced by the crosses between the same coloured flowers, than between those which are differently coloured. yet these varieties of verbascum present no other difference besides the mere colour of the flower; and one variety can sometimes be raised from the seed of the other. from observations which i have made on certain varieties of hollyhock, i am inclined to suspect that they present analogous facts. kolreuter, whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent observer, has proved the remarkable fact, that one variety of the common tobacco is more fertile, when crossed with a widely distinct species, than are the other varieties. he experimentised on five forms, which are commonly reputed to be varieties, and which he tested by the severest trial, namely, by reciprocal crosses, and he found their mongrel offspring perfectly fertile. but one of these five varieties, when used either as father or mother, and crossed with the nicotiana glutinosa, always yielded hybrids not so sterile as those which were produced from the four other varieties when crossed with n. glutinosa. hence the reproductive system of this one variety must have been in some manner and in some degree modified. from these facts; from the great difficulty of ascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state of nature, for a supposed variety if infertile in any degree would generally be ranked as species; from man selecting only external characters in the production of the most distinct domestic varieties, and from not wishing or being able to produce recondite and functional differences in the reproductive system; from these several considerations and facts, i do not think that the very general fertility of varieties can be proved to be of universal occurrence, or to form a fundamental distinction between varieties and species. the general fertility of varieties does not seem to me sufficient to overthrow the view which i have taken with respect to the very general, but not invariable, sterility of first crosses and of hybrids, namely, that it is not a special endowment, but is incidental on slowly acquired modifications, more especially in the reproductive systems of the forms which are crossed. hybrids and mongrels compared, independently of their fertility. independently of the question of fertility, the offspring of species when crossed and of varieties when crossed may be compared in several other respects. gartner, whose strong wish was to draw a marked line of distinction between species and varieties, could find very few and, as it seems to me, quite unimportant differences between the so-called hybrid offspring of species, and the so-called mongrel offspring of varieties. and, on the other hand, they agree most closely in very many important respects. i shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity. the most important distinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are more variable than hybrids; but gartner admits that hybrids from species which have long been cultivated are often variable in the first generation; and i have myself seen striking instances of this fact. gartner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species are more variable than those from very distinct species; and this shows that the difference in the degree of variability graduates away. when mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several generations an extreme amount of variability in their offspring is notorious; but some few cases both of hybrids and mongrels long retaining uniformity of character could be given. the variability, however, in the successive generations of mongrels is, perhaps, greater than in hybrids. this greater variability of mongrels than of hybrids does not seem to me at all surprising. for the parents of mongrels are varieties, and mostly domestic varieties (very few experiments having been tried on natural varieties), and this implies in most cases that there has been recent variability; and therefore we might expect that such variability would often continue and be super-added to that arising from the mere act of crossing. the slight degree of variability in hybrids from the first cross or in the first generation, in contrast with their extreme variability in the succeeding generations, is a curious fact and deserves attention. for it bears on and corroborates the view which i have taken on the cause of ordinary variability; namely, that it is due to the reproductive system being eminently sensitive to any change in the conditions of life, being thus often rendered either impotent or at least incapable of its proper function of producing offspring identical with the parent-form. now hybrids in the first generation are descended from species (excluding those long cultivated) which have not had their reproductive systems in any way affected, and they are not variable; but hybrids themselves have their reproductive systems seriously affected, and their descendants are highly variable. but to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids: gartner states that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either parent-form; but this, if it be true, is certainly only a difference in degree. gartner further insists that when any two species, although most closely allied to each other, are crossed with a third species, the hybrids are widely different from each other; whereas if two very distinct varieties of one species are crossed with another species, the hybrids do not differ much. but this conclusion, as far as i can make out, is founded on a single experiment; and seems directly opposed to the results of several experiments made by kolreuter. these alone are the unimportant differences, which gartner is able to point out, between hybrid and mongrel plants. on the other hand, the resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their respective parents, more especially in hybrids produced from nearly related species, follows according to gartner the same laws. when two species are crossed, one has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing its likeness on the hybrid; and so i believe it to be with varieties of plants. with animals one variety certainly often has this prepotent power over another variety. hybrid plants produced from a reciprocal cross, generally resemble each other closely; and so it is with mongrels from a reciprocal cross. both hybrids and mongrels can be reduced to either pure parent-form, by repeated crosses in successive generations with either parent. these several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but the subject is here excessively complicated, partly owing to the existence of secondary sexual characters; but more especially owing to prepotency in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in the other, both when one species is crossed with another, and when one variety is crossed with another variety. for instance, i think those authors are right, who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over the horse, so that both the mule and the hinny more resemble the ass than the horse; but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the male-ass than in the female, so that the mule, which is the offspring of the male-ass and mare, is more like an ass, than is the hinny, which is the offspring of the female-ass and stallion. much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact, that mongrel animals alone are born closely like one of their parents; but it can be shown that this does sometimes occur with hybrids; yet i grant much less frequently with hybrids than with mongrels. looking to the cases which i have collected of cross-bred animals closely resembling one parent, the resemblances seem chiefly confined to characters almost monstrous in their nature, and which have suddenly appeared--such as albinism, melanism, deficiency of tail or horns, or additional fingers and toes; and do not relate to characters which have been slowly acquired by selection. consequently, sudden reversions to the perfect character of either parent would be more likely to occur with mongrels, which are descended from varieties often suddenly produced and semi-monstrous in character, than with hybrids, which are descended from species slowly and naturally produced. on the whole i entirely agree with dr. prosper lucas, who, after arranging an enormous body of facts with respect to animals, comes to the conclusion, that the laws of resemblance of the child to its parents are the same, whether the two parents differ much or little from each other, namely in the union of individuals of the same variety, or of different varieties, or of distinct species. laying aside the question of fertility and sterility, in all other respects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the offspring of crossed species, and of crossed varieties. if we look at species as having been specially created, and at varieties as having been produced by secondary laws, this similarity would be an astonishing fact. but it harmonises perfectly with the view that there is no essential distinction between species and varieties. summary of chapter. first crosses between forms sufficiently distinct to be ranked as species, and their hybrids, are very generally, but not universally, sterile. the sterility is of all degrees, and is often so slight that the two most careful experimentalists who have ever lived, have come to diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test. the sterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species, and is eminently susceptible of favourable and unfavourable conditions. the degree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity, but is governed by several curious and complex laws. it is generally different, and sometimes widely different, in reciprocal crosses between the same two species. it is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in the hybrid produced from this cross. in the same manner as in grafting trees, the capacity of one species or variety to take on another, is incidental on generally unknown differences in their vegetative systems, so in crossing, the greater or less facility of one species to unite with another, is incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems. there is no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to prevent them crossing and blending in nature, than to think that trees have been specially endowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent them becoming inarched in our forests. the sterility of first crosses between pure species, which have their reproductive systems perfect, seems to depend on several circumstances; in some cases largely on the early death of the embryo. the sterility of hybrids, which have their reproductive systems imperfect, and which have had this system and their whole organisation disturbed by being compounded of two distinct species, seems closely allied to that sterility which so frequently affects pure species, when their natural conditions of life have been disturbed. this view is supported by a parallelism of another kind;--namely, that the crossing of forms only slightly different is favourable to the vigour and fertility of their offspring; and that slight changes in the conditions of life are apparently favourable to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings. it is not surprising that the degree of difficulty in uniting two species, and the degree of sterility of their hybrid-offspring should generally correspond, though due to distinct causes; for both depend on the amount of difference of some kind between the species which are crossed. nor is it surprising that the facility of effecting a first cross, the fertility of the hybrids produced, and the capacity of being grafted together--though this latter capacity evidently depends on widely different circumstances--should all run, to a certain extent, parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms which are subjected to experiment; for systematic affinity attempts to express all kinds of resemblance between all species. first crosses between forms known to be varieties, or sufficiently alike to be considered as varieties, and their mongrel offspring, are very generally, but not quite universally, fertile. nor is this nearly general and perfect fertility surprising, when we remember how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature; and when we remember that the greater number of varieties have been produced under domestication by the selection of mere external differences, and not of differences in the reproductive system. in all other respects, excluding fertility, there is a close general resemblance between hybrids and mongrels. finally, then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to, but even rather to support the view, that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties. 9. on the imperfection of the geological record. on the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day. on the nature of extinct intermediate varieties; on their number. on the vast lapse of time, as inferred from the rate of deposition and of denudation. on the poorness of our palaeontological collections. on the intermittence of geological formations. on the absence of intermediate varieties in any one formation. on the sudden appearance of groups of species. on their sudden appearance in the lowest known fossiliferous strata. in the sixth chapter i enumerated the chief objections which might be justly urged against the views maintained in this volume. most of them have now been discussed. one, namely the distinctness of specific forms, and their not being blended together by innumerable transitional links, is a very obvious difficulty. i assigned reasons why such links do not commonly occur at the present day, under the circumstances apparently most favourable for their presence, namely on an extensive and continuous area with graduated physical conditions. i endeavoured to show, that the life of each species depends in a more important manner on the presence of other already defined organic forms, than on climate; and, therefore, that the really governing conditions of life do not graduate away quite insensibly like heat or moisture. i endeavoured, also, to show that intermediate varieties, from existing in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, will generally be beaten out and exterminated during the course of further modification and improvement. the main cause, however, of innumerable intermediate links not now occurring everywhere throughout nature depends on the very process of natural selection, through which new varieties continually take the places of and exterminate their parent-forms. but just in proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed on the earth, be truly enormous. why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. the explanation lies, as i believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record. in the first place it should always be borne in mind what sort of intermediate forms must, on my theory, have formerly existed. i have found it difficult, when looking at any two species, to avoid picturing to myself, forms directly intermediate between them. but this is a wholly false view; we should always look for forms intermediate between each species and a common but unknown progenitor; and the progenitor will generally have differed in some respects from all its modified descendants. to give a simple illustration: the fantail and pouter pigeons have both descended from the rock-pigeon; if we possessed all the intermediate varieties which have ever existed, we should have an extremely close series between both and the rock-pigeon; but we should have no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter; none, for instance, combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop somewhat enlarged, the characteristic features of these two breeds. these two breeds, moreover, have become so much modified, that if we had no historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin, it would not have been possible to have determined from a mere comparison of their structure with that of the rock-pigeon, whether they had descended from this species or from some other allied species, such as c. oenas. so with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for instance to the horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that links ever existed directly intermediate between them, but between each and an unknown common parent. the common parent will have had in its whole organisation much general resemblance to the tapir and to the horse; but in some points of structure may have differed considerably from both, even perhaps more than they differ from each other. hence in all such cases, we should be unable to recognise the parent-form of any two or more species, even if we closely compared the structure of the parent with that of its modified descendants, unless at the same time we had a nearly perfect chain of the intermediate links. it is just possible by my theory, that one of two living forms might have descended from the other; for instance, a horse from a tapir; and in this case direct intermediate links will have existed between them. but such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very long period unaltered, whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of change; and the principle of competition between organism and organism, between child and parent, will render this a very rare event; for in all cases the new and improved forms of life will tend to supplant the old and unimproved forms. by the theory of natural selection all living species have been connected with the parent-species of each genus, by differences not greater than we see between the varieties of the same species at the present day; and these parent-species, now generally extinct, have in their turn been similarly connected with more ancient species; and so on backwards, always converging to the common ancestor of each great class. so that the number of intermediate and transitional links, between all living and extinct species, must have been inconceivably great. but assuredly, if this theory be true, such have lived upon this earth. on the lapse of time. independently of our not finding fossil remains of such infinitely numerous connecting links, it may be objected, that time will not have sufficed for so great an amount of organic change, all changes having been effected very slowly through natural selection. it is hardly possible for me even to recall to the reader, who may not be a practical geologist, the facts leading the mind feebly to comprehend the lapse of time. he who can read sir charles lyell's grand work on the principles of geology, which the future historian will recognise as having produced a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how incomprehensibly vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume. not that it suffices to study the principles of geology, or to read special treatises by different observers on separate formations, and to mark how each author attempts to give an inadequate idea of the duration of each formation or even each stratum. a man must for years examine for himself great piles of superimposed strata, and watch the sea at work grinding down old rocks and making fresh sediment, before he can hope to comprehend anything of the lapse of time, the monuments of which we see around us. it is good to wander along lines of sea-coast, when formed of moderately hard rocks, and mark the process of degradation. the tides in most cases reach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day, and the waves eat into them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles; for there is reason to believe that pure water can effect little or nothing in wearing away rock. at last the base of the cliff is undermined, huge fragments fall down, and these remaining fixed, have to be worn away, atom by atom, until reduced in size they can be rolled about by the waves, and then are more quickly ground into pebbles, sand, or mud. but how often do we see along the bases of retreating cliffs rounded boulders, all thickly clothed by marine productions, showing how little they are abraded and how seldom they are rolled about! moreover, if we follow for a few miles any line of rocky cliff, which is undergoing degradation, we find that it is only here and there, along a short length or round a promontory, that the cliffs are at the present time suffering. the appearance of the surface and the vegetation show that elsewhere years have elapsed since the waters washed their base. he who most closely studies the action of the sea on our shores, will, i believe, be most deeply impressed with the slowness with which rocky coasts are worn away. the observations on this head by hugh miller, and by that excellent observer mr. smith of jordan hill, are most impressive. with the mind thus impressed, let any one examine beds of conglomerate many thousand feet in thickness, which, though probably formed at a quicker rate than many other deposits, yet, from being formed of worn and rounded pebbles, each of which bears the stamp of time, are good to show how slowly the mass has been accumulated. let him remember lyell's profound remark, that the thickness and extent of sedimentary formations are the result and measure of the degradation which the earth's crust has elsewhere suffered. and what an amount of degradation is implied by the sedimentary deposits of many countries! professor ramsay has given me the maximum thickness, in most cases from actual measurement, in a few cases from estimate, of each formation in different parts of great britain; and this is the result:-- feet palaeozoic strata (not including igneous beds)..57,154. secondary strata................................13,190. tertiary strata..................................2,240. --making altogether 72,584 feet; that is, very nearly thirteen and three-quarters british miles. some of these formations, which are represented in england by thin beds, are thousands of feet in thickness on the continent. moreover, between each successive formation, we have, in the opinion of most geologists, enormously long blank periods. so that the lofty pile of sedimentary rocks in britain, gives but an inadequate idea of the time which has elapsed during their accumulation; yet what time this must have consumed! good observers have estimated that sediment is deposited by the great mississippi river at the rate of only 600 feet in a hundred thousand years. this estimate may be quite erroneous; yet, considering over what wide spaces very fine sediment is transported by the currents of the sea, the process of accumulation in any one area must be extremely slow. but the amount of denudation which the strata have in many places suffered, independently of the rate of accumulation of the degraded matter, probably offers the best evidence of the lapse of time. i remember having been much struck with the evidence of denudation, when viewing volcanic islands, which have been worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular cliffs of one or two thousand feet in height; for the gentle slope of the lava-streams, due to their formerly liquid state, showed at a glance how far the hard, rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean. the same story is still more plainly told by faults,--those great cracks along which the strata have been upheaved on one side, or thrown down on the other, to the height or depth of thousands of feet; for since the crust cracked, the surface of the land has been so completely planed down by the action of the sea, that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible. the craven fault, for instance, extends for upwards of 30 miles, and along this line the vertical displacement of the strata has varied from 600 to 3000 feet. professor ramsay has published an account of a downthrow in anglesea of 2300 feet; and he informs me that he fully believes there is one in merionethshire of 12,000 feet; yet in these cases there is nothing on the surface to show such prodigious movements; the pile of rocks on the one or other side having been smoothly swept away. the consideration of these facts impresses my mind almost in the same manner as does the vain endeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity. i am tempted to give one other case, the well-known one of the denudation of the weald. though it must be admitted that the denudation of the weald has been a mere trifle, in comparison with that which has removed masses of our palaeozoic strata, in parts ten thousand feet in thickness, as shown in professor ramsay's masterly memoir on this subject. yet it is an admirable lesson to stand on the north downs and to look at the distant south downs; for, remembering that at no great distance to the west the northern and southern escarpments meet and close, one can safely picture to oneself the great dome of rocks which must have covered up the weald within so limited a period as since the latter part of the chalk formation. the distance from the northern to the southern downs is about 22 miles, and the thickness of the several formations is on an average about 1100 feet, as i am informed by professor ramsay. but if, as some geologists suppose, a range of older rocks underlies the weald, on the flanks of which the overlying sedimentary deposits might have accumulated in thinner masses than elsewhere, the above estimate would be erroneous; but this source of doubt probably would not greatly affect the estimate as applied to the western extremity of the district. if, then, we knew the rate at which the sea commonly wears away a line of cliff of any given height, we could measure the time requisite to have denuded the weald. this, of course, cannot be done; but we may, in order to form some crude notion on the subject, assume that the sea would eat into cliffs 500 feet in height at the rate of one inch in a century. this will at first appear much too small an allowance; but it is the same as if we were to assume a cliff one yard in height to be eaten back along a whole line of coast at the rate of one yard in nearly every twenty-two years. i doubt whether any rock, even as soft as chalk, would yield at this rate excepting on the most exposed coasts; though no doubt the degradation of a lofty cliff would be more rapid from the breakage of the fallen fragments. on the other hand, i do not believe that any line of coast, ten or twenty miles in length, ever suffers degradation at the same time along its whole indented length; and we must remember that almost all strata contain harder layers or nodules, which from long resisting attrition form a breakwater at the base. hence, under ordinary circumstances, i conclude that for a cliff 500 feet in height, a denudation of one inch per century for the whole length would be an ample allowance. at this rate, on the above data, the denudation of the weald must have required 306,662,400 years; or say three hundred million years. the action of fresh water on the gently inclined wealden district, when upraised, could hardly have been great, but it would somewhat reduce the above estimate. on the other hand, during oscillations of level, which we know this area has undergone, the surface may have existed for millions of years as land, and thus have escaped the action of the sea: when deeply submerged for perhaps equally long periods, it would, likewise, have escaped the action of the coast-waves. so that in all probability a far longer period than 300 million years has elapsed since the latter part of the secondary period. i have made these few remarks because it is highly important for us to gain some notion, however imperfect, of the lapse of years. during each of these years, over the whole world, the land and the water has been peopled by hosts of living forms. what an infinite number of generations, which the mind cannot grasp, must have succeeded each other in the long roll of years! now turn to our richest geological museums, and what a paltry display we behold! on the poorness of our palaeontological collections. that our palaeontological collections are very imperfect, is admitted by every one. the remark of that admirable palaeontologist, the late edward forbes, should not be forgotten, namely, that numbers of our fossil species are known and named from single and often broken specimens, or from a few specimens collected on some one spot. only a small portion of the surface of the earth has been geologically explored, and no part with sufficient care, as the important discoveries made every year in europe prove. no organism wholly soft can be preserved. shells and bones will decay and disappear when left on the bottom of the sea, where sediment is not accumulating. i believe we are continually taking a most erroneous view, when we tacitly admit to ourselves that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea, at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains. throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright blue tint of the water bespeaks its purity. the many cases on record of a formation conformably covered, after an enormous interval of time, by another and later formation, without the underlying bed having suffered in the interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on the view of the bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition. the remains which do become embedded, if in sand or gravel, will when the beds are upraised generally be dissolved by the percolation of rain-water. i suspect that but few of the very many animals which live on the beach between high and low watermark are preserved. for instance, the several species of the chthamalinae (a sub-family of sessile cirripedes) coat the rocks all over the world in infinite numbers: they are all strictly littoral, with the exception of a single mediterranean species, which inhabits deep water and has been found fossil in sicily, whereas not one other species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation: yet it is now known that the genus chthamalus existed during the chalk period. the molluscan genus chiton offers a partially analogous case. with respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the secondary and palaeozoic periods, it is superfluous to state that our evidence from fossil remains is fragmentary in an extreme degree. for instance, not a land shell is known belonging to either of these vast periods, with one exception discovered by sir c. lyell in the carboniferous strata of north america. in regard to mammiferous remains, a single glance at the historical table published in the supplement to lyell's manual, will bring home the truth, how accidental and rare is their preservation, far better than pages of detail. nor is their rarity surprising, when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of tertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine deposits; and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging to the age of our secondary or palaeozoic formations. but the imperfection in the geological record mainly results from another and more important cause than any of the foregoing; namely, from the several formations being separated from each other by wide intervals of time. when we see the formations tabulated in written works, or when we follow them in nature, it is difficult to avoid believing that they are closely consecutive. but we know, for instance, from sir r. murchison's great work on russia, what wide gaps there are in that country between the superimposed formations; so it is in north america, and in many other parts of the world. the most skilful geologist, if his attention had been exclusively confined to these large territories, would never have suspected that during the periods which were blank and barren in his own country, great piles of sediment, charged with new and peculiar forms of life, had elsewhere been accumulated. and if in each separate territory, hardly any idea can be formed of the length of time which has elapsed between the consecutive formations, we may infer that this could nowhere be ascertained. the frequent and great changes in the mineralogical composition of consecutive formations, generally implying great changes in the geography of the surrounding lands, whence the sediment has been derived, accords with the belief of vast intervals of time having elapsed between each formation. but we can, i think, see why the geological formations of each region are almost invariably intermittent; that is, have not followed each other in close sequence. scarcely any fact struck me more when examining many hundred miles of the south american coasts, which have been upraised several hundred feet within the recent period, than the absence of any recent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short geological period. along the whole west coast, which is inhabited by a peculiar marine fauna, tertiary beds are so scantily developed, that no record of several successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be preserved to a distant age. a little reflection will explain why along the rising coast of the western side of south america, no extensive formations with recent or tertiary remains can anywhere be found, though the supply of sediment must for ages have been great, from the enormous degradation of the coast-rocks and from muddy streams entering the sea. the explanation, no doubt, is, that the littoral and sub-littoral deposits are continually worn away, as soon as they are brought up by the slow and gradual rising of the land within the grinding action of the coast-waves. we may, i think, safely conclude that sediment must be accumulated in extremely thick, solid, or extensive masses, in order to withstand the incessant action of the waves, when first upraised and during subsequent oscillations of level. such thick and extensive accumulations of sediment may be formed in two ways; either, in profound depths of the sea, in which case, judging from the researches of e. forbes, we may conclude that the bottom will be inhabited by extremely few animals, and the mass when upraised will give a most imperfect record of the forms of life which then existed; or, sediment may be accumulated to any thickness and extent over a shallow bottom, if it continue slowly to subside. in this latter case, as long as the rate of subsidence and supply of sediment nearly balance each other, the sea will remain shallow and favourable for life, and thus a fossiliferous formation thick enough, when upraised, to resist any amount of degradation, may be formed. i am convinced that all our ancient formations, which are rich in fossils, have thus been formed during subsidence. since publishing my views on this subject in 1845, i have watched the progress of geology, and have been surprised to note how author after author, in treating of this or that great formation, has come to the conclusion that it was accumulated during subsidence. i may add, that the only ancient tertiary formation on the west coast of south america, which has been bulky enough to resist such degradation as it has as yet suffered, but which will hardly last to a distant geological age, was certainly deposited during a downward oscillation of level, and thus gained considerable thickness. all geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone numerous slow oscillations of level, and apparently these oscillations have affected wide spaces. consequently formations rich in fossils and sufficiently thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation, may have been formed over wide spaces during periods of subsidence, but only where the supply of sediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and to embed and preserve the remains before they had time to decay. on the other hand, as long as the bed of the sea remained stationary, thick deposits could not have been accumulated in the shallow parts, which are the most favourable to life. still less could this have happened during the alternate periods of elevation; or, to speak more accurately, the beds which were then accumulated will have been destroyed by being upraised and brought within the limits of the coast-action. thus the geological record will almost necessarily be rendered intermittent. i feel much confidence in the truth of these views, for they are in strict accordance with the general principles inculcated by sir c. lyell; and e. forbes independently arrived at a similar conclusion. one remark is here worth a passing notice. during periods of elevation the area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of the sea will be increased, and new stations will often be formed;--all circumstances most favourable, as previously explained, for the formation of new varieties and species; but during such periods there will generally be a blank in the geological record. on the other hand, during subsidence, the inhabited area and number of inhabitants will decrease (excepting the productions on the shores of a continent when first broken up into an archipelago), and consequently during subsidence, though there will be much extinction, fewer new varieties or species will be formed; and it is during these very periods of subsidence, that our great deposits rich in fossils have been accumulated. nature may almost be said to have guarded against the frequent discovery of her transitional or linking forms. from the foregoing considerations it cannot be doubted that the geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect; but if we confine our attention to any one formation, it becomes more difficult to understand, why we do not therein find closely graduated varieties between the allied species which lived at its commencement and at its close. some cases are on record of the same species presenting distinct varieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation, but, as they are rare, they may be here passed over. although each formation has indisputably required a vast number of years for its deposition, i can see several reasons why each should not include a graduated series of links between the species which then lived; but i can by no means pretend to assign due proportional weight to the following considerations. although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each perhaps is short compared with the period requisite to change one species into another. i am aware that two palaeontologists, whose opinions are worthy of much deference, namely bronn and woodward, have concluded that the average duration of each formation is twice or thrice as long as the average duration of specific forms. but insuperable difficulties, as it seems to me, prevent us coming to any just conclusion on this head. when we see a species first appearing in the middle of any formation, it would be rash in the extreme to infer that it had not elsewhere previously existed. so again when we find a species disappearing before the uppermost layers have been deposited, it would be equally rash to suppose that it then became wholly extinct. we forget how small the area of europe is compared with the rest of the world; nor have the several stages of the same formation throughout europe been correlated with perfect accuracy. with marine animals of all kinds, we may safely infer a large amount of migration during climatal and other changes; and when we see a species first appearing in any formation, the probability is that it only then first immigrated into that area. it is well known, for instance, that several species appeared somewhat earlier in the palaeozoic beds of north america than in those of europe; time having apparently been required for their migration from the american to the european seas. in examining the latest deposits of various quarters of the world, it has everywhere been noted, that some few still existing species are common in the deposit, but have become extinct in the immediately surrounding sea; or, conversely, that some are now abundant in the neighbouring sea, but are rare or absent in this particular deposit. it is an excellent lesson to reflect on the ascertained amount of migration of the inhabitants of europe during the glacial period, which forms only a part of one whole geological period; and likewise to reflect on the great changes of level, on the inordinately great change of climate, on the prodigious lapse of time, all included within this same glacial period. yet it may be doubted whether in any quarter of the world, sedimentary deposits, including fossil remains, have gone on accumulating within the same area during the whole of this period. it is not, for instance, probable that sediment was deposited during the whole of the glacial period near the mouth of the mississippi, within that limit of depth at which marine animals can flourish; for we know what vast geographical changes occurred in other parts of america during this space of time. when such beds as were deposited in shallow water near the mouth of the mississippi during some part of the glacial period shall have been upraised, organic remains will probably first appear and disappear at different levels, owing to the migration of species and to geographical changes. and in the distant future, a geologist examining these beds, might be tempted to conclude that the average duration of life of the embedded fossils had been less than that of the glacial period, instead of having been really far greater, that is extending from before the glacial epoch to the present day. in order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper and lower parts of the same formation, the deposit must have gone on accumulating for a very long period, in order to have given sufficient time for the slow process of variation; hence the deposit will generally have to be a very thick one; and the species undergoing modification will have had to live on the same area throughout this whole time. but we have seen that a thick fossiliferous formation can only be accumulated during a period of subsidence; and to keep the depth approximately the same, which is necessary in order to enable the same species to live on the same space, the supply of sediment must nearly have counterbalanced the amount of subsidence. but this same movement of subsidence will often tend to sink the area whence the sediment is derived, and thus diminish the supply whilst the downward movement continues. in fact, this nearly exact balancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of subsidence is probably a rare contingency; for it has been observed by more than one palaeontologist, that very thick deposits are usually barren of organic remains, except near their upper or lower limits. it would seem that each separate formation, like the whole pile of formations in any country, has generally been intermittent in its accumulation. when we see, as is so often the case, a formation composed of beds of different mineralogical composition, we may reasonably suspect that the process of deposition has been much interrupted, as a change in the currents of the sea and a supply of sediment of a different nature will generally have been due to geographical changes requiring much time. nor will the closest inspection of a formation give any idea of the time which its deposition has consumed. many instances could be given of beds only a few feet in thickness, representing formations, elsewhere thousands of feet in thickness, and which must have required an enormous period for their accumulation; yet no one ignorant of this fact would have suspected the vast lapse of time represented by the thinner formation. many cases could be given of the lower beds of a formation having been upraised, denuded, submerged, and then re-covered by the upper beds of the same formation,--facts, showing what wide, yet easily overlooked, intervals have occurred in its accumulation. in other cases we have the plainest evidence in great fossilised trees, still standing upright as they grew, of many long intervals of time and changes of level during the process of deposition, which would never even have been suspected, had not the trees chanced to have been preserved: thus, messrs. lyell and dawson found carboniferous beds 1400 feet thick in nova scotia, with ancient root-bearing strata, one above the other, at no less than sixty-eight different levels. hence, when the same species occur at the bottom, middle, and top of a formation, the probability is that they have not lived on the same spot during the whole period of deposition, but have disappeared and reappeared, perhaps many times, during the same geological period. so that if such species were to undergo a considerable amount of modification during any one geological period, a section would not probably include all the fine intermediate gradations which must on my theory have existed between them, but abrupt, though perhaps very slight, changes of form. it is all-important to remember that naturalists have no golden rule by which to distinguish species and varieties; they grant some little variability to each species, but when they meet with a somewhat greater amount of difference between any two forms, they rank both as species, unless they are enabled to connect them together by close intermediate gradations. and this from the reasons just assigned we can seldom hope to effect in any one geological section. supposing b and c to be two species, and a third, a, to be found in an underlying bed; even if a were strictly intermediate between b and c, it would simply be ranked as a third and distinct species, unless at the same time it could be most closely connected with either one or both forms by intermediate varieties. nor should it be forgotten, as before explained, that a might be the actual progenitor of b and c, and yet might not at all necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all points of structure. so that we might obtain the parent-species and its several modified descendants from the lower and upper beds of a formation, and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations, we should not recognise their relationship, and should consequently be compelled to rank them all as distinct species. it is notorious on what excessively slight differences many palaeontologists have founded their species; and they do this the more readily if the specimens come from different sub-stages of the same formation. some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of the very fine species of d'orbigny and others into the rank of varieties; and on this view we do find the kind of evidence of change which on my theory we ought to find. moreover, if we look to rather wider intervals, namely, to distinct but consecutive stages of the same great formation, we find that the embedded fossils, though almost universally ranked as specifically different, yet are far more closely allied to each other than are the species found in more widely separated formations; but to this subject i shall have to return in the following chapter. one other consideration is worth notice: with animals and plants that can propagate rapidly and are not highly locomotive, there is reason to suspect, as we have formerly seen, that their varieties are generally at first local; and that such local varieties do not spread widely and supplant their parent-forms until they have been modified and perfected in some considerable degree. according to this view, the chance of discovering in a formation in any one country all the early stages of transition between any two forms, is small, for the successive changes are supposed to have been local or confined to some one spot. most marine animals have a wide range; and we have seen that with plants it is those which have the widest range, that oftenest present varieties; so that with shells and other marine animals, it is probably those which have had the widest range, far exceeding the limits of the known geological formations of europe, which have oftenest given rise, first to local varieties and ultimately to new species; and this again would greatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace the stages of transition in any one geological formation. it should not be forgotten, that at the present day, with perfect specimens for examination, two forms can seldom be connected by intermediate varieties and thus proved to be the same species, until many specimens have been collected from many places; and in the case of fossil species this could rarely be effected by palaeontologists. we shall, perhaps, best perceive the improbability of our being enabled to connect species by numerous, fine, intermediate, fossil links, by asking ourselves whether, for instance, geologists at some future period will be able to prove, that our different breeds of cattle, sheep, horses, and dogs have descended from a single stock or from several aboriginal stocks; or, again, whether certain sea-shells inhabiting the shores of north america, which are ranked by some conchologists as distinct species from their european representatives, and by other conchologists as only varieties, are really varieties or are, as it is called, specifically distinct. this could be effected only by the future geologist discovering in a fossil state numerous intermediate gradations; and such success seems to me improbable in the highest degree. geological research, though it has added numerous species to existing and extinct genera, and has made the intervals between some few groups less wide than they otherwise would have been, yet has done scarcely anything in breaking down the distinction between species, by connecting them together by numerous, fine, intermediate varieties; and this not having been effected, is probably the gravest and most obvious of all the many objections which may be urged against my views. hence it will be worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks, under an imaginary illustration. the malay archipelago is of about the size of europe from the north cape to the mediterranean, and from britain to russia; and therefore equals all the geological formations which have been examined with any accuracy, excepting those of the united states of america. i fully agree with mr. godwin-austen, that the present condition of the malay archipelago, with its numerous large islands separated by wide and shallow seas, probably represents the former state of europe, when most of our formations were accumulating. the malay archipelago is one of the richest regions of the whole world in organic beings; yet if all the species were to be collected which have ever lived there, how imperfectly would they represent the natural history of the world! but we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of the archipelago would be preserved in an excessively imperfect manner in the formations which we suppose to be there accumulating. i suspect that not many of the strictly littoral animals, or of those which lived on naked submarine rocks, would be embedded; and those embedded in gravel or sand, would not endure to a distant epoch. wherever sediment did not accumulate on the bed of the sea, or where it did not accumulate at a sufficient rate to protect organic bodies from decay, no remains could be preserved. in our archipelago, i believe that fossiliferous formations could be formed of sufficient thickness to last to an age, as distant in futurity as the secondary formations lie in the past, only during periods of subsidence. these periods of subsidence would be separated from each other by enormous intervals, during which the area would be either stationary or rising; whilst rising, each fossiliferous formation would be destroyed, almost as soon as accumulated, by the incessant coast-action, as we now see on the shores of south america. during the periods of subsidence there would probably be much extinction of life; during the periods of elevation, there would be much variation, but the geological record would then be least perfect. it may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of subsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago, together with a contemporaneous accumulation of sediment, would exceed the average duration of the same specific forms; and these contingencies are indispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations between any two or more species. if such gradations were not fully preserved, transitional varieties would merely appear as so many distinct species. it is, also, probable that each great period of subsidence would be interrupted by oscillations of level, and that slight climatal changes would intervene during such lengthy periods; and in these cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would have to migrate, and no closely consecutive record of their modifications could be preserved in any one formation. very many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range thousands of miles beyond its confines; and analogy leads me to believe that it would be chiefly these far-ranging species which would oftenest produce new varieties; and the varieties would at first generally be local or confined to one place, but if possessed of any decided advantage, or when further modified and improved, they would slowly spread and supplant their parent-forms. when such varieties returned to their ancient homes, as they would differ from their former state, in a nearly uniform, though perhaps extremely slight degree, they would, according to the principles followed by many palaeontologists, be ranked as new and distinct species. if then, there be some degree of truth in these remarks, we have no right to expect to find in our geological formations, an infinite number of those fine transitional forms, which on my theory assuredly have connected all the past and present species of the same group into one long and branching chain of life. we ought only to look for a few links, some more closely, some more distantly related to each other; and these links, let them be ever so close, if found in different stages of the same formation, would, by most palaeontologists, be ranked as distinct species. but i do not pretend that i should ever have suspected how poor a record of the mutations of life, the best preserved geological section presented, had not the difficulty of our not discovering innumerable transitional links between the species which appeared at the commencement and close of each formation, pressed so hardly on my theory. on the sudden appearance of whole groups of allied species. the abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in certain formations, has been urged by several palaeontologists, for instance, by agassiz, pictet, and by none more forcibly than by professor sedgwick, as a fatal objection to the belief in the transmutation of species. if numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life all at once, the fact would be fatal to the theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection. for the development of a group of forms, all of which have descended from some one progenitor, must have been an extremely slow process; and the progenitors must have lived long ages before their modified descendants. but we continually over-rate the perfection of the geological record, and falsely infer, because certain genera or families have not been found beneath a certain stage, that they did not exist before that stage. we continually forget how large the world is, compared with the area over which our geological formations have been carefully examined; we forget that groups of species may elsewhere have long existed and have slowly multiplied before they invaded the ancient archipelagoes of europe and of the united states. we do not make due allowance for the enormous intervals of time, which have probably elapsed between our consecutive formations,--longer perhaps in some cases than the time required for the accumulation of each formation. these intervals will have given time for the multiplication of species from some one or some few parent-forms; and in the succeeding formation such species will appear as if suddenly created. i may here recall a remark formerly made, namely that it might require a long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar line of life, for instance to fly through the air; but that when this had been effected, and a few species had thus acquired a great advantage over other organisms, a comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many divergent forms, which would be able to spread rapidly and widely throughout the world. i will now give a few examples to illustrate these remarks; and to show how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of species have suddenly been produced. i may recall the well-known fact that in geological treatises, published not many years ago, the great class of mammals was always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the commencement of the tertiary series. and now one of the richest known accumulations of fossil mammals belongs to the middle of the secondary series; and one true mammal has been discovered in the new red sandstone at nearly the commencement of this great series. cuvier used to urge that no monkey occurred in any tertiary stratum; but now extinct species have been discovered in india, south america, and in europe even as far back as the eocene stage. the most striking case, however, is that of the whale family; as these animals have huge bones, are marine, and range over the world, the fact of not a single bone of a whale having been discovered in any secondary formation, seemed fully to justify the belief that this great and distinct order had been suddenly produced in the interval between the latest secondary and earliest tertiary formation. but now we may read in the supplement to lyell's 'manual,' published in 1858, clear evidence of the existence of whales in the upper greensand, some time before the close of the secondary period. i may give another instance, which from having passed under my own eyes has much struck me. in a memoir on fossil sessile cirripedes, i have stated that, from the number of existing and extinct tertiary species; from the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species all over the world, from the arctic regions to the equator, inhabiting various zones of depths from the upper tidal limits to 50 fathoms; from the perfect manner in which specimens are preserved in the oldest tertiary beds; from the ease with which even a fragment of a valve can be recognised; from all these circumstances, i inferred that had sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary periods, they would certainly have been preserved and discovered; and as not one species had been discovered in beds of this age, i concluded that this great group had been suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary series. this was a sore trouble to me, adding as i thought one more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of species. but my work had hardly been published, when a skilful palaeontologist, m. bosquet, sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of an unmistakeable sessile cirripede, which he had himself extracted from the chalk of belgium. and, as if to make the case as striking as possible, this sessile cirripede was a chthamalus, a very common, large, and ubiquitous genus, of which not one specimen has as yet been found even in any tertiary stratum. hence we now positively know that sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary period; and these cirripedes might have been the progenitors of our many tertiary and existing species. the case most frequently insisted on by palaeontologists of the apparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that of the teleostean fishes, low down in the chalk period. this group includes the large majority of existing species. lately, professor pictet has carried their existence one sub-stage further back; and some palaeontologists believe that certain much older fishes, of which the affinities are as yet imperfectly known, are really teleostean. assuming, however, that the whole of them did appear, as agassiz believes, at the commencement of the chalk formation, the fact would certainly be highly remarkable; but i cannot see that it would be an insuperable difficulty on my theory, unless it could likewise be shown that the species of this group appeared suddenly and simultaneously throughout the world at this same period. it is almost superfluous to remark that hardly any fossil-fish are known from south of the equator; and by running through pictet's palaeontology it will be seen that very few species are known from several formations in europe. some few families of fish now have a confined range; the teleostean fish might formerly have had a similarly confined range, and after having been largely developed in some one sea, might have spread widely. nor have we any right to suppose that the seas of the world have always been so freely open from south to north as they are at present. even at this day, if the malay archipelago were converted into land, the tropical parts of the indian ocean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin, in which any great group of marine animals might be multiplied; and here they would remain confined, until some of the species became adapted to a cooler climate, and were enabled to double the southern capes of africa or australia, and thus reach other and distant seas. from these and similar considerations, but chiefly from our ignorance of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of europe and the united states; and from the revolution in our palaeontological ideas on many points, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected, it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of organic beings throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its productions. on the sudden appearance of groups of allied species in the lowest known fossiliferous strata. there is another and allied difficulty, which is much graver. i allude to the manner in which numbers of species of the same group, suddenly appear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks. most of the arguments which have convinced me that all the existing species of the same group have descended from one progenitor, apply with nearly equal force to the earliest known species. for instance, i cannot doubt that all the silurian trilobites have descended from some one crustacean, which must have lived long before the silurian age, and which probably differed greatly from any known animal. some of the most ancient silurian animals, as the nautilus, lingula, etc., do not differ much from living species; and it cannot on my theory be supposed, that these old species were the progenitors of all the species of the orders to which they belong, for they do not present characters in any degree intermediate between them. if, moreover, they had been the progenitors of these orders, they would almost certainly have been long ago supplanted and exterminated by their numerous and improved descendants. consequently, if my theory be true, it is indisputable that before the lowest silurian stratum was deposited, long periods elapsed, as long as, or probably far longer than, the whole interval from the silurian age to the present day; and that during these vast, yet quite unknown, periods of time, the world swarmed with living creatures. to the question why we do not find records of these vast primordial periods, i can give no satisfactory answer. several of the most eminent geologists, with sir r. murchison at their head, are convinced that we see in the organic remains of the lowest silurian stratum the dawn of life on this planet. other highly competent judges, as lyell and the late e. forbes, dispute this conclusion. we should not forget that only a small portion of the world is known with accuracy. m. barrande has lately added another and lower stage to the silurian system, abounding with new and peculiar species. traces of life have been detected in the longmynd beds beneath barrande's so-called primordial zone. the presence of phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter in some of the lowest azoic rocks, probably indicates the former existence of life at these periods. but the difficulty of understanding the absence of vast piles of fossiliferous strata, which on my theory no doubt were somewhere accumulated before the silurian epoch, is very great. if these most ancient beds had been wholly worn away by denudation, or obliterated by metamorphic action, we ought to find only small remnants of the formations next succeeding them in age, and these ought to be very generally in a metamorphosed condition. but the descriptions which we now possess of the silurian deposits over immense territories in russia and in north america, do not support the view, that the older a formation is, the more it has suffered the extremity of denudation and metamorphism. the case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here entertained. to show that it may hereafter receive some explanation, i will give the following hypothesis. from the nature of the organic remains, which do not appear to have inhabited profound depths, in the several formations of europe and of the united states; and from the amount of sediment, miles in thickness, of which the formations are composed, we may infer that from first to last large islands or tracts of land, whence the sediment was derived, occurred in the neighbourhood of the existing continents of europe and north america. but we do not know what was the state of things in the intervals between the successive formations; whether europe and the united states during these intervals existed as dry land, or as a submarine surface near land, on which sediment was not deposited, or again as the bed of an open and unfathomable sea. looking to the existing oceans, which are thrice as extensive as the land, we see them studded with many islands; but not one oceanic island is as yet known to afford even a remnant of any palaeozoic or secondary formation. hence we may perhaps infer, that during the palaeozoic and secondary periods, neither continents nor continental islands existed where our oceans now extend; for had they existed there, palaeozoic and secondary formations would in all probability have been accumulated from sediment derived from their wear and tear; and would have been at least partially upheaved by the oscillations of level, which we may fairly conclude must have intervened during these enormously long periods. if then we may infer anything from these facts, we may infer that where our oceans now extend, oceans have extended from the remotest period of which we have any record; and on the other hand, that where continents now exist, large tracts of land have existed, subjected no doubt to great oscillations of level, since the earliest silurian period. the coloured map appended to my volume on coral reefs, led me to conclude that the great oceans are still mainly areas of subsidence, the great archipelagoes still areas of oscillations of level, and the continents areas of elevation. but have we any right to assume that things have thus remained from eternity? our continents seem to have been formed by a preponderance, during many oscillations of level, of the force of elevation; but may not the areas of preponderant movement have changed in the lapse of ages? at a period immeasurably antecedent to the silurian epoch, continents may have existed where oceans are now spread out; and clear and open oceans may have existed where our continents now stand. nor should we be justified in assuming that if, for instance, the bed of the pacific ocean were now converted into a continent, we should there find formations older than the silurian strata, supposing such to have been formerly deposited; for it might well happen that strata which had subsided some miles nearer to the centre of the earth, and which had been pressed on by an enormous weight of superincumbent water, might have undergone far more metamorphic action than strata which have always remained nearer to the surface. the immense areas in some parts of the world, for instance in south america, of bare metamorphic rocks, which must have been heated under great pressure, have always seemed to me to require some special explanation; and we may perhaps believe that we see in these large areas, the many formations long anterior to the silurian epoch in a completely metamorphosed condition. the several difficulties here discussed, namely our not finding in the successive formations infinitely numerous transitional links between the many species which now exist or have existed; the sudden manner in which whole groups of species appear in our european formations; the almost entire absence, as at present known, of fossiliferous formations beneath the silurian strata, are all undoubtedly of the gravest nature. we see this in the plainest manner by the fact that all the most eminent palaeontologists, namely cuvier, owen, agassiz, barrande, falconer, e. forbes, etc., and all our greatest geologists, as lyell, murchison, sedgwick, etc., have unanimously, often vehemently, maintained the immutability of species. but i have reason to believe that one great authority, sir charles lyell, from further reflexion entertains grave doubts on this subject. i feel how rash it is to differ from these great authorities, to whom, with others, we owe all our knowledge. those who think the natural geological record in any degree perfect, and who do not attach much weight to the facts and arguments of other kinds given in this volume, will undoubtedly at once reject my theory. for my part, following out lyell's metaphor, i look at the natural geological record, as a history of the world imperfectly kept, and written in a changing dialect; of this history we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or three countries. of this volume, only here and there a short chapter has been preserved; and of each page, only here and there a few lines. each word of the slowly-changing language, in which the history is supposed to be written, being more or less different in the interrupted succession of chapters, may represent the apparently abruptly changed forms of life, entombed in our consecutive, but widely separated formations. on this view, the difficulties above discussed are greatly diminished, or even disappear. 10. on the geological succession of organic beings. on the slow and successive appearance of new species. on their different rates of change. species once lost do not reappear. groups of species follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species. on extinction. on simultaneous changes in the forms of life throughout the world. on the affinities of extinct species to each other and to living species. on the state of development of ancient forms. on the succession of the same types within the same areas. summary of preceding and present chapters. let us now see whether the several facts and rules relating to the geological succession of organic beings, better accord with the common view of the immutability of species, or with that of their slow and gradual modification, through descent and natural selection. new species have appeared very slowly, one after another, both on the land and in the waters. lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to resist the evidence on this head in the case of the several tertiary stages; and every year tends to fill up the blanks between them, and to make the percentage system of lost and new forms more gradual. in some of the most recent beds, though undoubtedly of high antiquity if measured by years, only one or two species are lost forms, and only one or two are new forms, having here appeared for the first time, either locally, or, as far as we know, on the face of the earth. if we may trust the observations of philippi in sicily, the successive changes in the marine inhabitants of that island have been many and most gradual. the secondary formations are more broken; but, as bronn has remarked, neither the appearance nor disappearance of their many now extinct species has been simultaneous in each separate formation. species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. in the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms. falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact, in an existing crocodile associated with many strange and lost mammals and reptiles in the sub-himalayan deposits. the silurian lingula differs but little from the living species of this genus; whereas most of the other silurian molluscs and all the crustaceans have changed greatly. the productions of the land seem to change at a quicker rate than those of the sea, of which a striking instance has lately been observed in switzerland. there is some reason to believe that organisms, considered high in the scale of nature, change more quickly than those that are low: though there are exceptions to this rule. the amount of organic change, as pictet has remarked, does not strictly correspond with the succession of our geological formations; so that between each two consecutive formations, the forms of life have seldom changed in exactly the same degree. yet if we compare any but the most closely related formations, all the species will be found to have undergone some change. when a species has once disappeared from the face of the earth, we have reason to believe that the same identical form never reappears. the strongest apparent exception to this latter rule, is that of the so-called "colonies" of m. barrande, which intrude for a period in the midst of an older formation, and then allow the pre-existing fauna to reappear; but lyell's explanation, namely, that it is a case of temporary migration from a distinct geographical province, seems to me satisfactory. these several facts accord well with my theory. i believe in no fixed law of development, causing all the inhabitants of a country to change abruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree. the process of modification must be extremely slow. the variability of each species is quite independent of that of all others. whether such variability be taken advantage of by natural selection, and whether the variations be accumulated to a greater or lesser amount, thus causing a greater or lesser amount of modification in the varying species, depends on many complex contingencies,--on the variability being of a beneficial nature, on the power of intercrossing, on the rate of breeding, on the slowly changing physical conditions of the country, and more especially on the nature of the other inhabitants with which the varying species comes into competition. hence it is by no means surprising that one species should retain the same identical form much longer than others; or, if changing, that it should change less. we see the same fact in geographical distribution; for instance, in the land-shells and coleopterous insects of madeira having come to differ considerably from their nearest allies on the continent of europe, whereas the marine shells and birds have remained unaltered. we can perhaps understand the apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial and in more highly organised productions compared with marine and lower productions, by the more complex relations of the higher beings to their organic and inorganic conditions of life, as explained in a former chapter. when many of the inhabitants of a country have become modified and improved, we can understand, on the principle of competition, and on that of the many all-important relations of organism to organism, that any form which does not become in some degree modified and improved, will be liable to be exterminated. hence we can see why all the species in the same region do at last, if we look to wide enough intervals of time, become modified; for those which do not change will become extinct. in members of the same class the average amount of change, during long and equal periods of time, may, perhaps, be nearly the same; but as the accumulation of long-enduring fossiliferous formations depends on great masses of sediment having been deposited on areas whilst subsiding, our formations have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and irregularly intermittent intervals; consequently the amount of organic change exhibited by the fossils embedded in consecutive formations is not equal. each formation, on this view, does not mark a new and complete act of creation, but only an occasional scene, taken almost at hazard, in a slowly changing drama. we can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never reappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic and inorganic, should recur. for though the offspring of one species might be adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances) to fill the exact place of another species in the economy of nature, and thus supplant it; yet the two forms--the old and the new--would not be identically the same; for both would almost certainly inherit different characters from their distinct progenitors. for instance, it is just possible, if our fantail-pigeons were all destroyed, that fanciers, by striving during long ages for the same object, might make a new breed hardly distinguishable from our present fantail; but if the parent rock-pigeon were also destroyed, and in nature we have every reason to believe that the parent-form will generally be supplanted and exterminated by its improved offspring, it is quite incredible that a fantail, identical with the existing breed, could be raised from any other species of pigeon, or even from the other well-established races of the domestic pigeon, for the newly-formed fantail would be almost sure to inherit from its new progenitor some slight characteristic differences. groups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species, changing more or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser degree. a group does not reappear after it has once disappeared; or its existence, as long as it lasts, is continuous. i am aware that there are some apparent exceptions to this rule, but the exceptions are surprisingly few, so few, that e. forbes, pictet, and woodward (though all strongly opposed to such views as i maintain) admit its truth; and the rule strictly accords with my theory. for as all the species of the same group have descended from some one species, it is clear that as long as any species of the group have appeared in the long succession of ages, so long must its members have continuously existed, in order to have generated either new and modified or the same old and unmodified forms. species of the genus lingula, for instance, must have continuously existed by an unbroken succession of generations, from the lowest silurian stratum to the present day. we have seen in the last chapter that the species of a group sometimes falsely appear to have come in abruptly; and i have attempted to give an explanation of this fact, which if true would have been fatal to my views. but such cases are certainly exceptional; the general rule being a gradual increase in number, till the group reaches its maximum, and then, sooner or later, it gradually decreases. if the number of the species of a genus, or the number of the genera of a family, be represented by a vertical line of varying thickness, crossing the successive geological formations in which the species are found, the line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end, not in a sharp point, but abruptly; it then gradually thickens upwards, sometimes keeping for a space of equal thickness, and ultimately thins out in the upper beds, marking the decrease and final extinction of the species. this gradual increase in number of the species of a group is strictly conformable with my theory; as the species of the same genus, and the genera of the same family, can increase only slowly and progressively; for the process of modification and the production of a number of allied forms must be slow and gradual,--one species giving rise first to two or three varieties, these being slowly converted into species, which in their turn produce by equally slow steps other species, and so on, like the branching of a great tree from a single stem, till the group becomes large. on extinction. we have as yet spoken only incidentally of the disappearance of species and of groups of species. on the theory of natural selection the extinction of old forms and the production of new and improved forms are intimately connected together. the old notion of all the inhabitants of the earth having been swept away at successive periods by catastrophes, is very generally given up, even by those geologists, as elie de beaumont, murchison, barrande, etc., whose general views would naturally lead them to this conclusion. on the contrary, we have every reason to believe, from the study of the tertiary formations, that species and groups of species gradually disappear, one after another, first from one spot, then from another, and finally from the world. both single species and whole groups of species last for very unequal periods; some groups, as we have seen, having endured from the earliest known dawn of life to the present day; some having disappeared before the close of the palaeozoic period. no fixed law seems to determine the length of time during which any single species or any single genus endures. there is reason to believe that the complete extinction of the species of a group is generally a slower process than their production: if the appearance and disappearance of a group of species be represented, as before, by a vertical line of varying thickness, the line is found to taper more gradually at its upper end, which marks the progress of extermination, than at its lower end, which marks the first appearance and increase in numbers of the species. in some cases, however, the extermination of whole groups of beings, as of ammonites towards the close of the secondary period, has been wonderfully sudden. the whole subject of the extinction of species has been involved in the most gratuitous mystery. some authors have even supposed that as the individual has a definite length of life, so have species a definite duration. no one i think can have marvelled more at the extinction of species, than i have done. when i found in la plata the tooth of a horse embedded with the remains of mastodon, megatherium, toxodon, and other extinct monsters, which all co-existed with still living shells at a very late geological period, i was filled with astonishment; for seeing that the horse, since its introduction by the spaniards into south america, has run wild over the whole country and has increased in numbers at an unparalleled rate, i asked myself what could so recently have exterminated the former horse under conditions of life apparently so favourable. but how utterly groundless was my astonishment! professor owen soon perceived that the tooth, though so like that of the existing horse, belonged to an extinct species. had this horse been still living, but in some degree rare, no naturalist would have felt the least surprise at its rarity; for rarity is the attribute of a vast number of species of all classes, in all countries. if we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare, we answer that something is unfavourable in its conditions of life; but what that something is, we can hardly ever tell. on the supposition of the fossil horse still existing as a rare species, we might have felt certain from the analogy of all other mammals, even of the slow-breeding elephant, and from the history of the naturalisation of the domestic horse in south america, that under more favourable conditions it would in a very few years have stocked the whole continent. but we could not have told what the unfavourable conditions were which checked its increase, whether some one or several contingencies, and at what period of the horse's life, and in what degree, they severally acted. if the conditions had gone on, however slowly, becoming less and less favourable, we assuredly should not have perceived the fact, yet the fossil horse would certainly have become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct;--its place being seized on by some more successful competitor. it is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every living being is constantly being checked by unperceived injurious agencies; and that these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient to cause rarity, and finally extinction. we see in many cases in the more recent tertiary formations, that rarity precedes extinction; and we know that this has been the progress of events with those animals which have been exterminated, either locally or wholly, through man's agency. i may repeat what i published in 1845, namely, that to admit that species generally become rare before they become extinct--to feel no surprise at the rarity of a species, and yet to marvel greatly when it ceases to exist, is much the same as to admit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of death--to feel no surprise at sickness, but when the sick man dies, to wonder and to suspect that he died by some unknown deed of violence. the theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new variety, and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition; and the consequent extinction of less-favoured forms almost inevitably follows. it is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and slightly improved variety has been raised, it at first supplants the less improved varieties in the same neighbourhood; when much improved it is transported far and near, like our short-horn cattle, and takes the place of other breeds in other countries. thus the appearance of new forms and the disappearance of old forms, both natural and artificial, are bound together. in certain flourishing groups, the number of new specific forms which have been produced within a given time is probably greater than that of the old forms which have been exterminated; but we know that the number of species has not gone on indefinitely increasing, at least during the later geological periods, so that looking to later times we may believe that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about the same number of old forms. the competition will generally be most severe, as formerly explained and illustrated by examples, between the forms which are most like each other in all respects. hence the improved and modified descendants of a species will generally cause the extermination of the parent-species; and if many new forms have been developed from any one species, the nearest allies of that species, i.e. the species of the same genus, will be the most liable to extermination. thus, as i believe, a number of new species descended from one species, that is a new genus, comes to supplant an old genus, belonging to the same family. but it must often have happened that a new species belonging to some one group will have seized on the place occupied by a species belonging to a distinct group, and thus caused its extermination; and if many allied forms be developed from the successful intruder, many will have to yield their places; and it will generally be allied forms, which will suffer from some inherited inferiority in common. but whether it be species belonging to the same or to a distinct class, which yield their places to other species which have been modified and improved, a few of the sufferers may often long be preserved, from being fitted to some peculiar line of life, or from inhabiting some distant and isolated station, where they have escaped severe competition. for instance, a single species of trigonia, a great genus of shells in the secondary formations, survives in the australian seas; and a few members of the great and almost extinct group of ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters. therefore the utter extinction of a group is generally, as we have seen, a slower process than its production. with respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families or orders, as of trilobites at the close of the palaeozoic period and of ammonites at the close of the secondary period, we must remember what has been already said on the probable wide intervals of time between our consecutive formations; and in these intervals there may have been much slow extermination. moreover, when by sudden immigration or by unusually rapid development, many species of a new group have taken possession of a new area, they will have exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner many of the old inhabitants; and the forms which thus yield their places will commonly be allied, for they will partake of some inferiority in common. thus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and whole groups of species become extinct, accords well with the theory of natural selection. we need not marvel at extinction; if we must marvel, let it be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we understand the many complex contingencies, on which the existence of each species depends. if we forget for an instant, that each species tends to increase inordinately, and that some check is always in action, yet seldom perceived by us, the whole economy of nature will be utterly obscured. whenever we can precisely say why this species is more abundant in individuals than that; why this species and not another can be naturalised in a given country; then, and not till then, we may justly feel surprise why we cannot account for the extinction of this particular species or group of species. on the forms of life changing almost simultaneously throughout the world. scarcely any palaeontological discovery is more striking than the fact, that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the world. thus our european chalk formation can be recognised in many distant parts of the world, under the most different climates, where not a fragment of the mineral chalk itself can be found; namely, in north america, in equatorial south america, in tierra del fuego, at the cape of good hope, and in the peninsula of india. for at these distant points, the organic remains in certain beds present an unmistakeable degree of resemblance to those of the chalk. it is not that the same species are met with; for in some cases not one species is identically the same, but they belong to the same families, genera, and sections of genera, and sometimes are similarly characterised in such trifling points as mere superficial sculpture. moreover other forms, which are not found in the chalk of europe, but which occur in the formations either above or below, are similarly absent at these distant points of the world. in the several successive palaeozoic formations of russia, western europe and north america, a similar parallelism in the forms of life has been observed by several authors: so it is, according to lyell, with the several european and north american tertiary deposits. even if the few fossil species which are common to the old and new worlds be kept wholly out of view, the general parallelism in the successive forms of life, in the stages of the widely separated palaeozoic and tertiary periods, would still be manifest, and the several formations could be easily correlated. these observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of distant parts of the world: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the productions of the land and of fresh water change at distant points in the same parallel manner. we may doubt whether they have thus changed: if the megatherium, mylodon, macrauchenia, and toxodon had been brought to europe from la plata, without any information in regard to their geological position, no one would have suspected that they had coexisted with still living sea-shells; but as these anomalous monsters coexisted with the mastodon and horse, it might at least have been inferred that they had lived during one of the latter tertiary stages. when the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed simultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that this expression relates to the same thousandth or hundred-thousandth year, or even that it has a very strict geological sense; for if all the marine animals which live at the present day in europe, and all those that lived in europe during the pleistocene period (an enormously remote period as measured by years, including the whole glacial epoch), were to be compared with those now living in south america or in australia, the most skilful naturalist would hardly be able to say whether the existing or the pleistocene inhabitants of europe resembled most closely those of the southern hemisphere. so, again, several highly competent observers believe that the existing productions of the united states are more closely related to those which lived in europe during certain later tertiary stages, than to those which now live here; and if this be so, it is evident that fossiliferous beds deposited at the present day on the shores of north america would hereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older european beds. nevertheless, looking to a remotely future epoch, there can, i think, be little doubt that all the more modern marine formations, namely, the upper pliocene, the pleistocene and strictly modern beds, of europe, north and south america, and australia, from containing fossil remains in some degree allied, and from not including those forms which are only found in the older underlying deposits, would be correctly ranked as simultaneous in a geological sense. the fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously, in the above large sense, at distant parts of the world, has greatly struck those admirable observers, mm. de verneuil and d'archiac. after referring to the parallelism of the palaeozoic forms of life in various parts of europe, they add, "if struck by this strange sequence, we turn our attention to north america, and there discover a series of analogous phenomena, it will appear certain that all these modifications of species, their extinction, and the introduction of new ones, cannot be owing to mere changes in marine currents or other causes more or less local and temporary, but depend on general laws which govern the whole animal kingdom." m. barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely the same effect. it is, indeed, quite futile to look to changes of currents, climate, or other physical conditions, as the cause of these great mutations in the forms of life throughout the world, under the most different climates. we must, as barrande has remarked, look to some special law. we shall see this more clearly when we treat of the present distribution of organic beings, and find how slight is the relation between the physical conditions of various countries, and the nature of their inhabitants. this great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life throughout the world, is explicable on the theory of natural selection. new species are formed by new varieties arising, which have some advantage over older forms; and those forms, which are already dominant, or have some advantage over the other forms in their own country, would naturally oftenest give rise to new varieties or incipient species; for these latter must be victorious in a still higher degree in order to be preserved and to survive. we have distinct evidence on this head, in the plants which are dominant, that is, which are commonest in their own homes, and are most widely diffused, having produced the greatest number of new varieties. it is also natural that the dominant, varying, and far-spreading species, which already have invaded to a certain extent the territories of other species, should be those which would have the best chance of spreading still further, and of giving rise in new countries to new varieties and species. the process of diffusion may often be very slow, being dependent on climatal and geographical changes, or on strange accidents, but in the long run the dominant forms will generally succeed in spreading. the diffusion would, it is probable, be slower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct continents than with the marine inhabitants of the continuous sea. we might therefore expect to find, as we apparently do find, a less strict degree of parallel succession in the productions of the land than of the sea. dominant species spreading from any region might encounter still more dominant species, and then their triumphant course, or even their existence, would cease. we know not at all precisely what are all the conditions most favourable for the multiplication of new and dominant species; but we can, i think, clearly see that a number of individuals, from giving a better chance of the appearance of favourable variations, and that severe competition with many already existing forms, would be highly favourable, as would be the power of spreading into new territories. a certain amount of isolation, recurring at long intervals of time, would probably be also favourable, as before explained. one quarter of the world may have been most favourable for the production of new and dominant species on the land, and another for those in the waters of the sea. if two great regions had been for a long period favourably circumstanced in an equal degree, whenever their inhabitants met, the battle would be prolonged and severe; and some from one birthplace and some from the other might be victorious. but in the course of time, the forms dominant in the highest degree, wherever produced, would tend everywhere to prevail. as they prevailed, they would cause the extinction of other and inferior forms; and as these inferior forms would be allied in groups by inheritance, whole groups would tend slowly to disappear; though here and there a single member might long be enabled to survive. thus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large sense, simultaneous, succession of the same forms of life throughout the world, accords well with the principle of new species having been formed by dominant species spreading widely and varying; the new species thus produced being themselves dominant owing to inheritance, and to having already had some advantage over their parents or over other species; these again spreading, varying, and producing new species. the forms which are beaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious forms, will generally be allied in groups, from inheriting some inferiority in common; and therefore as new and improved groups spread throughout the world, old groups will disappear from the world; and the succession of forms in both ways will everywhere tend to correspond. there is one other remark connected with this subject worth making. i have given my reasons for believing that all our greater fossiliferous formations were deposited during periods of subsidence; and that blank intervals of vast duration occurred during the periods when the bed of the sea was either stationary or rising, and likewise when sediment was not thrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains. during these long and blank intervals i suppose that the inhabitants of each region underwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction, and that there was much migration from other parts of the world. as we have reason to believe that large areas are affected by the same movement, it is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations have often been accumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world; but we are far from having any right to conclude that this has invariably been the case, and that large areas have invariably been affected by the same movements. when two formations have been deposited in two regions during nearly, but not exactly the same period, we should find in both, from the causes explained in the foregoing paragraphs, the same general succession in the forms of life; but the species would not exactly correspond; for there will have been a little more time in the one region than in the other for modification, extinction, and immigration. i suspect that cases of this nature have occurred in europe. mr. prestwich, in his admirable memoirs on the eocene deposits of england and france, is able to draw a close general parallelism between the successive stages in the two countries; but when he compares certain stages in england with those in france, although he finds in both a curious accordance in the numbers of the species belonging to the same genera, yet the species themselves differ in a manner very difficult to account for, considering the proximity of the two areas,--unless, indeed, it be assumed that an isthmus separated two seas inhabited by distinct, but contemporaneous, faunas. lyell has made similar observations on some of the later tertiary formations. barrande, also, shows that there is a striking general parallelism in the successive silurian deposits of bohemia and scandinavia; nevertheless he finds a surprising amount of difference in the species. if the several formations in these regions have not been deposited during the same exact periods,--a formation in one region often corresponding with a blank interval in the other,--and if in both regions the species have gone on slowly changing during the accumulation of the several formations and during the long intervals of time between them; in this case, the several formations in the two regions could be arranged in the same order, in accordance with the general succession of the form of life, and the order would falsely appear to be strictly parallel; nevertheless the species would not all be the same in the apparently corresponding stages in the two regions. on the affinities of extinct species to each other, and to living forms. let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living species. they all fall into one grand natural system; and this fact is at once explained on the principle of descent. the more ancient any form is, the more, as a general rule, it differs from living forms. but, as buckland long ago remarked, all fossils can be classed either in still existing groups, or between them. that the extinct forms of life help to fill up the wide intervals between existing genera, families, and orders, cannot be disputed. for if we confine our attention either to the living or to the extinct alone, the series is far less perfect than if we combine both into one general system. with respect to the vertebrata, whole pages could be filled with striking illustrations from our great palaeontologist, owen, showing how extinct animals fall in between existing groups. cuvier ranked the ruminants and pachyderms, as the two most distinct orders of mammals; but owen has discovered so many fossil links, that he has had to alter the whole classification of these two orders; and has placed certain pachyderms in the same sub-order with ruminants: for example, he dissolves by fine gradations the apparently wide difference between the pig and the camel. in regard to the invertebrata, barrande, and a higher authority could not be named, asserts that he is every day taught that palaeozoic animals, though belonging to the same orders, families, or genera with those living at the present day, were not at this early epoch limited in such distinct groups as they now are. some writers have objected to any extinct species or group of species being considered as intermediate between living species or groups. if by this term it is meant that an extinct form is directly intermediate in all its characters between two living forms, the objection is probably valid. but i apprehend that in a perfectly natural classification many fossil species would have to stand between living species, and some extinct genera between living genera, even between genera belonging to distinct families. the most common case, especially with respect to very distinct groups, such as fish and reptiles, seems to be, that supposing them to be distinguished at the present day from each other by a dozen characters, the ancient members of the same two groups would be distinguished by a somewhat lesser number of characters, so that the two groups, though formerly quite distinct, at that period made some small approach to each other. it is a common belief that the more ancient a form is, by so much the more it tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widely separated from each other. this remark no doubt must be restricted to those groups which have undergone much change in the course of geological ages; and it would be difficult to prove the truth of the proposition, for every now and then even a living animal, as the lepidosiren, is discovered having affinities directed towards very distinct groups. yet if we compare the older reptiles and batrachians, the older fish, the older cephalopods, and the eocene mammals, with the more recent members of the same classes, we must admit that there is some truth in the remark. let us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the theory of descent with modification. as the subject is somewhat complex, i must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter. we may suppose that the numbered letters represent genera, and the dotted lines diverging from them the species in each genus. the diagram is much too simple, too few genera and too few species being given, but this is unimportant for us. the horizontal lines may represent successive geological formations, and all the forms beneath the uppermost line may be considered as extinct. the three existing genera, a14, q14, p14, will form a small family; b14 and f14 a closely allied family or sub-family; and o14, e14, m14, a third family. these three families, together with the many extinct genera on the several lines of descent diverging from the parent-form a, will form an order; for all will have inherited something in common from their ancient and common progenitor. on the principle of the continued tendency to divergence of character, which was formerly illustrated by this diagram, the more recent any form is, the more it will generally differ from its ancient progenitor. hence we can understand the rule that the most ancient fossils differ most from existing forms. we must not, however, assume that divergence of character is a necessary contingency; it depends solely on the descendants from a species being thus enabled to seize on many and different places in the economy of nature. therefore it is quite possible, as we have seen in the case of some silurian forms, that a species might go on being slightly modified in relation to its slightly altered conditions of life, and yet retain throughout a vast period the same general characteristics. this is represented in the diagram by the letter f14. all the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from a, make, as before remarked, one order; and this order, from the continued effects of extinction and divergence of character, has become divided into several sub-families and families, some of which are supposed to have perished at different periods, and some to have endured to the present day. by looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms, supposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were discovered at several points low down in the series, the three existing families on the uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other. if, for instance, the genera a1, a5, a10, f8, m3, m6, m9 were disinterred, these three families would be so closely linked together that they probably would have to be united into one great family, in nearly the same manner as has occurred with ruminants and pachyderms. yet he who objected to call the extinct genera, which thus linked the living genera of three families together, intermediate in character, would be justified, as they are intermediate, not directly, but only by a long and circuitous course through many widely different forms. if many extinct forms were to be discovered above one of the middle horizontal lines or geological formations--for instance, above number vi.--but none from beneath this line, then only the two families on the left hand (namely, a14, etc., and b14, etc.) would have to be united into one family; and the two other families (namely, a14 to f14 now including five genera, and o14 to m14) would yet remain distinct. these two families, however, would be less distinct from each other than they were before the discovery of the fossils. if, for instance, we suppose the existing genera of the two families to differ from each other by a dozen characters, in this case the genera, at the early period marked vi., would differ by a lesser number of characters; for at this early stage of descent they have not diverged in character from the common progenitor of the order, nearly so much as they subsequently diverged. thus it comes that ancient and extinct genera are often in some slight degree intermediate in character between their modified descendants, or between their collateral relations. in nature the case will be far more complicated than is represented in the diagram; for the groups will have been more numerous, they will have endured for extremely unequal lengths of time, and will have been modified in various degrees. as we possess only the last volume of the geological record, and that in a very broken condition, we have no right to expect, except in very rare cases, to fill up wide intervals in the natural system, and thus unite distinct families or orders. all that we have a right to expect, is that those groups, which have within known geological periods undergone much modification, should in the older formations make some slight approach to each other; so that the older members should differ less from each other in some of their characters than do the existing members of the same groups; and this by the concurrent evidence of our best palaeontologists seems frequently to be the case. thus, on the theory of descent with modification, the main facts with respect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each other and to living forms, seem to me explained in a satisfactory manner. and they are wholly inexplicable on any other view. on this same theory, it is evident that the fauna of any great period in the earth's history will be intermediate in general character between that which preceded and that which succeeded it. thus, the species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram are the modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and are the parents of those which became still more modified at the seventh stage; hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in character between the forms of life above and below. we must, however, allow for the entire extinction of some preceding forms, and for the coming in of quite new forms by immigration, and for a large amount of modification, during the long and blank intervals between the successive formations. subject to these allowances, the fauna of each geological period undoubtedly is intermediate in character, between the preceding and succeeding faunas. i need give only one instance, namely, the manner in which the fossils of the devonian system, when this system was first discovered, were at once recognised by palaeontologists as intermediate in character between those of the overlying carboniferous, and underlying silurian system. but each fauna is not necessarily exactly intermediate, as unequal intervals of time have elapsed between consecutive formations. it is no real objection to the truth of the statement, that the fauna of each period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the preceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer exceptions to the rule. for instance, mastodons and elephants, when arranged by dr. falconer in two series, first according to their mutual affinities and then according to their periods of existence, do not accord in arrangement. the species extreme in character are not the oldest, or the most recent; nor are those which are intermediate in character, intermediate in age. but supposing for an instant, in this and other such cases, that the record of the first appearance and disappearance of the species was perfect, we have no reason to believe that forms successively produced necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of time: a very ancient form might occasionally last much longer than a form elsewhere subsequently produced, especially in the case of terrestrial productions inhabiting separated districts. to compare small things with great: if the principal living and extinct races of the domestic pigeon were arranged as well as they could be in serial affinity, this arrangement would not closely accord with the order in time of their production, and still less with the order of their disappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon now lives; and many varieties between the rock-pigeon and the carrier have become extinct; and carriers which are extreme in the important character of length of beak originated earlier than short-beaked tumblers, which are at the opposite end of the series in this same respect. closely connected with the statement, that the organic remains from an intermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character, is the fact, insisted on by all palaeontologists, that fossils from two consecutive formations are far more closely related to each other, than are the fossils from two remote formations. pictet gives as a well-known instance, the general resemblance of the organic remains from the several stages of the chalk formation, though the species are distinct in each stage. this fact alone, from its generality, seems to have shaken professor pictet in his firm belief in the immutability of species. he who is acquainted with the distribution of existing species over the globe, will not attempt to account for the close resemblance of the distinct species in closely consecutive formations, by the physical conditions of the ancient areas having remained nearly the same. let it be remembered that the forms of life, at least those inhabiting the sea, have changed almost simultaneously throughout the world, and therefore under the most different climates and conditions. consider the prodigious vicissitudes of climate during the pleistocene period, which includes the whole glacial period, and note how little the specific forms of the inhabitants of the sea have been affected. on the theory of descent, the full meaning of the fact of fossil remains from closely consecutive formations, though ranked as distinct species, being closely related, is obvious. as the accumulation of each formation has often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have intervened between successive formations, we ought not to expect to find, as i attempted to show in the last chapter, in any one or two formations all the intermediate varieties between the species which appeared at the commencement and close of these periods; but we ought to find after intervals, very long as measured by years, but only moderately long as measured geologically, closely allied forms, or, as they have been called by some authors, representative species; and these we assuredly do find. we find, in short, such evidence of the slow and scarcely sensible mutation of specific forms, as we have a just right to expect to find. on the state of development of ancient forms. there has been much discussion whether recent forms are more highly developed than ancient. i will not here enter on this subject, for naturalists have not as yet defined to each other's satisfaction what is meant by high and low forms. but in one particular sense the more recent forms must, on my theory, be higher than the more ancient; for each new species is formed by having had some advantage in the struggle for life over other and preceding forms. if under a nearly similar climate, the eocene inhabitants of one quarter of the world were put into competition with the existing inhabitants of the same or some other quarter, the eocene fauna or flora would certainly be beaten and exterminated; as would a secondary fauna by an eocene, and a palaeozoic fauna by a secondary fauna. i do not doubt that this process of improvement has affected in a marked and sensible manner the organisation of the more recent and victorious forms of life, in comparison with the ancient and beaten forms; but i can see no way of testing this sort of progress. crustaceans, for instance, not the highest in their own class, may have beaten the highest molluscs. from the extraordinary manner in which european productions have recently spread over new zealand, and have seized on places which must have been previously occupied, we may believe, if all the animals and plants of great britain were set free in new zealand, that in the course of time a multitude of british forms would become thoroughly naturalized there, and would exterminate many of the natives. on the other hand, from what we see now occurring in new zealand, and from hardly a single inhabitant of the southern hemisphere having become wild in any part of europe, we may doubt, if all the productions of new zealand were set free in great britain, whether any considerable number would be enabled to seize on places now occupied by our native plants and animals. under this point of view, the productions of great britain may be said to be higher than those of new zealand. yet the most skilful naturalist from an examination of the species of the two countries could not have foreseen this result. agassiz insists that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent animals of the same classes; or that the geological succession of extinct forms is in some degree parallel to the embryological development of recent forms. i must follow pictet and huxley in thinking that the truth of this doctrine is very far from proved. yet i fully expect to see it hereafter confirmed, at least in regard to subordinate groups, which have branched off from each other within comparatively recent times. for this doctrine of agassiz accords well with the theory of natural selection. in a future chapter i shall attempt to show that the adult differs from its embryo, owing to variations supervening at a not early age, and being inherited at a corresponding age. this process, whilst it leaves the embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of successive generations, more and more difference to the adult. thus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature, of the ancient and less modified condition of each animal. this view may be true, and yet it may never be capable of full proof. seeing, for instance, that the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fish strictly belong to their own proper classes, though some of these old forms are in a slight degree less distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same groups at the present day, it would be vain to look for animals having the common embryological character of the vertebrata, until beds far beneath the lowest silurian strata are discovered--a discovery of which the chance is very small. on the succession of the same types within the same areas, during the later tertiary periods. mr. clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the australian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of that continent. in south america, a similar relationship is manifest, even to an uneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of armour like those of the armadillo, found in several parts of la plata; and professor owen has shown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals, buried there in such numbers, are related to south american types. this relationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of fossil bones made by mm. lund and clausen in the caves of brazil. i was so much impressed with these facts that i strongly insisted, in 1839 and 1845, on this "law of the succession of types,"--on "this wonderful relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living." professor owen has subsequently extended the same generalisation to the mammals of the old world. we see the same law in this author's restorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of new zealand. we see it also in the birds of the caves of brazil. mr. woodward has shown that the same law holds good with sea-shells, but from the wide distribution of most genera of molluscs, it is not well displayed by them. other cases could be added, as the relation between the extinct and living land-shells of madeira; and between the extinct and living brackish-water shells of the aralo-caspian sea. now what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same types within the same areas mean? he would be a bold man, who after comparing the present climate of australia and of parts of south america under the same latitude, would attempt to account, on the one hand, by dissimilar physical conditions for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of these two continents, and, on the other hand, by similarity of conditions, for the uniformity of the same types in each during the later tertiary periods. nor can it be pretended that it is an immutable law that marsupials should have been chiefly or solely produced in australia; or that edentata and other american types should have been solely produced in south america. for we know that europe in ancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials; and i have shown in the publications above alluded to, that in america the law of distribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what it now is. north america formerly partook strongly of the present character of the southern half of the continent; and the southern half was formerly more closely allied, than it is at present, to the northern half. in a similar manner we know from falconer and cautley's discoveries, that northern india was formerly more closely related in its mammals to africa than it is at the present time. analogous facts could be given in relation to the distribution of marine animals. on the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the long enduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types within the same areas, is at once explained; for the inhabitants of each quarter of the world will obviously tend to leave in that quarter, during the next succeeding period of time, closely allied though in some degree modified descendants. if the inhabitants of one continent formerly differed greatly from those of another continent, so will their modified descendants still differ in nearly the same manner and degree. but after very long intervals of time and after great geographical changes, permitting much inter-migration, the feebler will yield to the more dominant forms, and there will be nothing immutable in the laws of past and present distribution. it may be asked in ridicule, whether i suppose that the megatherium and other allied huge monsters have left behind them in south america the sloth, armadillo, and anteater, as their degenerate descendants. this cannot for an instant be admitted. these huge animals have become wholly extinct, and have left no progeny. but in the caves of brazil, there are many extinct species which are closely allied in size and in other characters to the species still living in south america; and some of these fossils may be the actual progenitors of living species. it must not be forgotten that, on my theory, all the species of the same genus have descended from some one species; so that if six genera, each having eight species, be found in one geological formation, and in the next succeeding formation there be six other allied or representative genera with the same number of species, then we may conclude that only one species of each of the six older genera has left modified descendants, constituting the six new genera. the other seven species of the old genera have all died out and have left no progeny. or, which would probably be a far commoner case, two or three species of two or three alone of the six older genera will have been the parents of the six new genera; the other old species and the other whole genera having become utterly extinct. in failing orders, with the genera and species decreasing in numbers, as apparently is the case of the edentata of south america, still fewer genera and species will have left modified blood-descendants. summary of the preceding and present chapters. i have attempted to show that the geological record is extremely imperfect; that only a small portion of the globe has been geologically explored with care; that only certain classes of organic beings have been largely preserved in a fossil state; that the number both of specimens and of species, preserved in our museums, is absolutely as nothing compared with the incalculable number of generations which must have passed away even during a single formation; that, owing to subsidence being necessary for the accumulation of fossiliferous deposits thick enough to resist future degradation, enormous intervals of time have elapsed between the successive formations; that there has probably been more extinction during the periods of subsidence, and more variation during the periods of elevation, and during the latter the record will have been least perfectly kept; that each single formation has not been continuously deposited; that the duration of each formation is, perhaps, short compared with the average duration of specific forms; that migration has played an important part in the first appearance of new forms in any one area and formation; that widely ranging species are those which have varied most, and have oftenest given rise to new species; and that varieties have at first often been local. all these causes taken conjointly, must have tended to make the geological record extremely imperfect, and will to a large extent explain why we do not find interminable varieties, connecting together all the extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps. he who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record, will rightly reject my whole theory. for he may ask in vain where are the numberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the closely allied or representative species, found in the several stages of the same great formation. he may disbelieve in the enormous intervals of time which have elapsed between our consecutive formations; he may overlook how important a part migration must have played, when the formations of any one great region alone, as that of europe, are considered; he may urge the apparent, but often falsely apparent, sudden coming in of whole groups of species. he may ask where are the remains of those infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long before the first bed of the silurian system was deposited: i can answer this latter question only hypothetically, by saying that as far as we can see, where our oceans now extend they have for an enormous period extended, and where our oscillating continents now stand they have stood ever since the silurian epoch; but that long before that period, the world may have presented a wholly different aspect; and that the older continents, formed of formations older than any known to us, may now all be in a metamorphosed condition, or may lie buried under the ocean. passing from these difficulties, all the other great leading facts in palaeontology seem to me simply to follow on the theory of descent with modification through natural selection. we can thus understand how it is that new species come in slowly and successively; how species of different classes do not necessarily change together, or at the same rate, or in the same degree; yet in the long run that all undergo modification to some extent. the extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of the production of new forms. we can understand why when a species has once disappeared it never reappears. groups of species increase in numbers slowly, and endure for unequal periods of time; for the process of modification is necessarily slow, and depends on many complex contingencies. the dominant species of the larger dominant groups tend to leave many modified descendants, and thus new sub-groups and groups are formed. as these are formed, the species of the less vigorous groups, from their inferiority inherited from a common progenitor, tend to become extinct together, and to leave no modified offspring on the face of the earth. but the utter extinction of a whole group of species may often be a very slow process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in protected and isolated situations. when a group has once wholly disappeared, it does not reappear; for the link of generation has been broken. we can understand how the spreading of the dominant forms of life, which are those that oftenest vary, will in the long run tend to people the world with allied, but modified, descendants; and these will generally succeed in taking the places of those groups of species which are their inferiors in the struggle for existence. hence, after long intervals of time, the productions of the world will appear to have changed simultaneously. we can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient and recent, make together one grand system; for all are connected by generation. we can understand, from the continued tendency to divergence of character, why the more ancient a form is, the more it generally differs from those now living. why ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between existing forms, sometimes blending two groups previously classed as distinct into one; but more commonly only bringing them a little closer together. the more ancient a form is, the more often, apparently, it displays characters in some degree intermediate between groups now distinct; for the more ancient a form is, the more nearly it will be related to, and consequently resemble, the common progenitor of groups, since become widely divergent. extinct forms are seldom directly intermediate between existing forms; but are intermediate only by a long and circuitous course through many extinct and very different forms. we can clearly see why the organic remains of closely consecutive formations are more closely allied to each other, than are those of remote formations; for the forms are more closely linked together by generation: we can clearly see why the remains of an intermediate formation are intermediate in character. the inhabitants of each successive period in the world's history have beaten their predecessors in the race for life, and are, in so far, higher in the scale of nature; and this may account for that vague yet ill-defined sentiment, felt by many palaeontologists, that organisation on the whole has progressed. if it should hereafter be proved that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of more recent animals of the same class, the fact will be intelligible. the succession of the same types of structure within the same areas during the later geological periods ceases to be mysterious, and is simply explained by inheritance. if then the geological record be as imperfect as i believe it to be, and it may at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be much more perfect, the main objections to the theory of natural selection are greatly diminished or disappear. on the other hand, all the chief laws of palaeontology plainly proclaim, as it seems to me, that species have been produced by ordinary generation: old forms having been supplanted by new and improved forms of life, produced by the laws of variation still acting round us, and preserved by natural selection. 11. geographical distribution. present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical conditions. importance of barriers. affinity of the productions of the same continent. centres of creation. means of dispersal, by changes of climate and of the level of the land, and by occasional means. dispersal during the glacial period co-extensive with the world. in considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of the globe, the first great fact which strikes us is, that neither the similarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions can be accounted for by their climatal and other physical conditions. of late, almost every author who has studied the subject has come to this conclusion. the case of america alone would almost suffice to prove its truth: for if we exclude the northern parts where the circumpolar land is almost continuous, all authors agree that one of the most fundamental divisions in geographical distribution is that between the new and old worlds; yet if we travel over the vast american continent, from the central parts of the united states to its extreme southern point, we meet with the most diversified conditions; the most humid districts, arid deserts, lofty mountains, grassy plains, forests, marshes, lakes, and great rivers, under almost every temperature. there is hardly a climate or condition in the old world which cannot be paralleled in the new--at least as closely as the same species generally require; for it is a most rare case to find a group of organisms confined to any small spot, having conditions peculiar in only a slight degree; for instance, small areas in the old world could be pointed out hotter than any in the new world, yet these are not inhabited by a peculiar fauna or flora. notwithstanding this parallelism in the conditions of the old and new worlds, how widely different are their living productions! in the southern hemisphere, if we compare large tracts of land in australia, south africa, and western south america, between latitudes 25 deg and 35 deg, we shall find parts extremely similar in all their conditions, yet it would not be possible to point out three faunas and floras more utterly dissimilar. or again we may compare the productions of south america south of lat. 35 deg with those north of 25 deg, which consequently inhabit a considerably different climate, and they will be found incomparably more closely related to each other, than they are to the productions of australia or africa under nearly the same climate. analogous facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of the sea. a second great fact which strikes us in our general review is, that barriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a close and important manner to the differences between the productions of various regions. we see this in the great difference of nearly all the terrestrial productions of the new and old worlds, excepting in the northern parts, where the land almost joins, and where, under a slightly different climate, there might have been free migration for the northern temperate forms, as there now is for the strictly arctic productions. we see the same fact in the great difference between the inhabitants of australia, africa, and south america under the same latitude: for these countries are almost as much isolated from each other as is possible. on each continent, also, we see the same fact; for on the opposite sides of lofty and continuous mountain-ranges, and of great deserts, and sometimes even of large rivers, we find different productions; though as mountain chains, deserts, etc., are not as impassable, or likely to have endured so long as the oceans separating continents, the differences are very inferior in degree to those characteristic of distinct continents. turning to the sea, we find the same law. no two marine faunas are more distinct, with hardly a fish, shell, or crab in common, than those of the eastern and western shores of south and central america; yet these great faunas are separated only by the narrow, but impassable, isthmus of panama. westward of the shores of america, a wide space of open ocean extends, with not an island as a halting-place for emigrants; here we have a barrier of another kind, and as soon as this is passed we meet in the eastern islands of the pacific, with another and totally distinct fauna. so that here three marine faunas range far northward and southward, in parallel lines not far from each other, under corresponding climates; but from being separated from each other by impassable barriers, either of land or open sea, they are wholly distinct. on the other hand, proceeding still further westward from the eastern islands of the tropical parts of the pacific, we encounter no impassable barriers, and we have innumerable islands as halting-places, until after travelling over a hemisphere we come to the shores of africa; and over this vast space we meet with no well-defined and distinct marine faunas. although hardly one shell, crab or fish is common to the above-named three approximate faunas of eastern and western america and the eastern pacific islands, yet many fish range from the pacific into the indian ocean, and many shells are common to the eastern islands of the pacific and the eastern shores of africa, on almost exactly opposite meridians of longitude. a third great fact, partly included in the foregoing statements, is the affinity of the productions of the same continent or sea, though the species themselves are distinct at different points and stations. it is a law of the widest generality, and every continent offers innumerable instances. nevertheless the naturalist in travelling, for instance, from north to south never fails to be struck by the manner in which successive groups of beings, specifically distinct, yet clearly related, replace each other. he hears from closely allied, yet distinct kinds of birds, notes nearly similar, and sees their nests similarly constructed, but not quite alike, with eggs coloured in nearly the same manner. the plains near the straits of magellan are inhabited by one species of rhea (american ostrich), and northward the plains of la plata by another species of the same genus; and not by a true ostrich or emeu, like those found in africa and australia under the same latitude. on these same plains of la plata, we see the agouti and bizcacha, animals having nearly the same habits as our hares and rabbits and belonging to the same order of rodents, but they plainly display an american type of structure. we ascend the lofty peaks of the cordillera and we find an alpine species of bizcacha; we look to the waters, and we do not find the beaver or musk-rat, but the coypu and capybara, rodents of the american type. innumerable other instances could be given. if we look to the islands off the american shore, however much they may differ in geological structure, the inhabitants, though they may be all peculiar species, are essentially american. we may look back to past ages, as shown in the last chapter, and we find american types then prevalent on the american continent and in the american seas. we see in these facts some deep organic bond, prevailing throughout space and time, over the same areas of land and water, and independent of their physical conditions. the naturalist must feel little curiosity, who is not led to inquire what this bond is. this bond, on my theory, is simply inheritance, that cause which alone, as far as we positively know, produces organisms quite like, or, as we see in the case of varieties nearly like each other. the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of different regions may be attributed to modification through natural selection, and in a quite subordinate degree to the direct influence of different physical conditions. the degree of dissimilarity will depend on the migration of the more dominant forms of life from one region into another having been effected with more or less ease, at periods more or less remote;--on the nature and number of the former immigrants;--and on their action and reaction, in their mutual struggles for life;--the relation of organism to organism being, as i have already often remarked, the most important of all relations. thus the high importance of barriers comes into play by checking migration; as does time for the slow process of modification through natural selection. widely-ranging species, abounding in individuals, which have already triumphed over many competitors in their own widely-extended homes will have the best chance of seizing on new places, when they spread into new countries. in their new homes they will be exposed to new conditions, and will frequently undergo further modification and improvement; and thus they will become still further victorious, and will produce groups of modified descendants. on this principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case. i believe, as was remarked in the last chapter, in no law of necessary development. as the variability of each species is an independent property, and will be taken advantage of by natural selection, only so far as it profits the individual in its complex struggle for life, so the degree of modification in different species will be no uniform quantity. if, for instance, a number of species, which stand in direct competition with each other, migrate in a body into a new and afterwards isolated country, they will be little liable to modification; for neither migration nor isolation in themselves can do anything. these principles come into play only by bringing organisms into new relations with each other, and in a lesser degree with the surrounding physical conditions. as we have seen in the last chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same character from an enormously remote geological period, so certain species have migrated over vast spaces, and have not become greatly modified. on these views, it is obvious, that the several species of the same genus, though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world, must originally have proceeded from the same source, as they have descended from the same progenitor. in the case of those species, which have undergone during whole geological periods but little modification, there is not much difficulty in believing that they may have migrated from the same region; for during the vast geographical and climatal changes which will have supervened since ancient times, almost any amount of migration is possible. but in many other cases, in which we have reason to believe that the species of a genus have been produced within comparatively recent times, there is great difficulty on this head. it is also obvious that the individuals of the same species, though now inhabiting distant and isolated regions, must have proceeded from one spot, where their parents were first produced: for, as explained in the last chapter, it is incredible that individuals identically the same should ever have been produced through natural selection from parents specifically distinct. we are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed by naturalists, namely, whether species have been created at one or more points of the earth's surface. undoubtedly there are very many cases of extreme difficulty, in understanding how the same species could possibly have migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated points, where now found. nevertheless the simplicity of the view that each species was first produced within a single region captivates the mind. he who rejects it, rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation with subsequent migration, and calls in the agency of a miracle. it is universally admitted, that in most cases the area inhabited by a species is continuous; and when a plant or animal inhabits two points so distant from each other, or with an interval of such a nature, that the space could not be easily passed over by migration, the fact is given as something remarkable and exceptional. the capacity of migrating across the sea is more distinctly limited in terrestrial mammals, than perhaps in any other organic beings; and, accordingly, we find no inexplicable cases of the same mammal inhabiting distant points of the world. no geologist will feel any difficulty in such cases as great britain having been formerly united to europe, and consequently possessing the same quadrupeds. but if the same species can be produced at two separate points, why do we not find a single mammal common to europe and australia or south america? the conditions of life are nearly the same, so that a multitude of european animals and plants have become naturalised in america and australia; and some of the aboriginal plants are identically the same at these distant points of the northern and southern hemispheres? the answer, as i believe, is, that mammals have not been able to migrate, whereas some plants, from their varied means of dispersal, have migrated across the vast and broken interspace. the great and striking influence which barriers of every kind have had on distribution, is intelligible only on the view that the great majority of species have been produced on one side alone, and have not been able to migrate to the other side. some few families, many sub-families, very many genera, and a still greater number of sections of genera are confined to a single region; and it has been observed by several naturalists, that the most natural genera, or those genera in which the species are most closely related to each other, are generally local, or confined to one area. what a strange anomaly it would be, if, when coming one step lower in the series, to the individuals of the same species, a directly opposite rule prevailed; and species were not local, but had been produced in two or more distinct areas! hence it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the view of each species having been produced in one area alone, and having subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the most probable. undoubtedly many cases occur, in which we cannot explain how the same species could have passed from one point to the other. but the geographical and climatal changes, which have certainly occurred within recent geological times, must have interrupted or rendered discontinuous the formerly continuous range of many species. so that we are reduced to consider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous and of so grave a nature, that we ought to give up the belief, rendered probable by general considerations, that each species has been produced within one area, and has migrated thence as far as it could. it would be hopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same species, now living at distant and separated points; nor do i for a moment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many such cases. but after some preliminary remarks, i will discuss a few of the most striking classes of facts; namely, the existence of the same species on the summits of distant mountain-ranges, and at distant points in the arctic and antarctic regions; and secondly (in the following chapter), the wide distribution of freshwater productions; and thirdly, the occurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands and on the mainland, though separated by hundreds of miles of open sea. if the existence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the earth's surface, can in many instances be explained on the view of each species having migrated from a single birthplace; then, considering our ignorance with respect to former climatal and geographical changes and various occasional means of transport, the belief that this has been the universal law, seems to me incomparably the safest. in discussing this subject, we shall be enabled at the same time to consider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the several distinct species of a genus, which on my theory have all descended from a common progenitor, can have migrated (undergoing modification during some part of their migration) from the area inhabited by their progenitor. if it can be shown to be almost invariably the case, that a region, of which most of its inhabitants are closely related to, or belong to the same genera with the species of a second region, has probably received at some former period immigrants from this other region, my theory will be strengthened; for we can clearly understand, on the principle of modification, why the inhabitants of a region should be related to those of another region, whence it has been stocked. a volcanic island, for instance, upheaved and formed at the distance of a few hundreds of miles from a continent, would probably receive from it in the course of time a few colonists, and their descendants, though modified, would still be plainly related by inheritance to the inhabitants of the continent. cases of this nature are common, and are, as we shall hereafter more fully see, inexplicable on the theory of independent creation. this view of the relation of species in one region to those in another, does not differ much (by substituting the word variety for species) from that lately advanced in an ingenious paper by mr. wallace, in which he concludes, that "every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing closely allied species." and i now know from correspondence, that this coincidence he attributes to generation with modification. the previous remarks on "single and multiple centres of creation" do not directly bear on another allied question,--namely whether all the individuals of the same species have descended from a single pair, or single hermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from many individuals simultaneously created. with those organic beings which never intercross (if such exist), the species, on my theory, must have descended from a succession of improved varieties, which will never have blended with other individuals or varieties, but will have supplanted each other; so that, at each successive stage of modification and improvement, all the individuals of each variety will have descended from a single parent. but in the majority of cases, namely, with all organisms which habitually unite for each birth, or which often intercross, i believe that during the slow process of modification the individuals of the species will have been kept nearly uniform by intercrossing; so that many individuals will have gone on simultaneously changing, and the whole amount of modification will not have been due, at each stage, to descent from a single parent. to illustrate what i mean: our english racehorses differ slightly from the horses of every other breed; but they do not owe their difference and superiority to descent from any single pair, but to continued care in selecting and training many individuals during many generations. before discussing the three classes of facts, which i have selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of "single centres of creation," i must say a few words on the means of dispersal. means of dispersal. sir c. lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject. i can give here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts. change of climate must have had a powerful influence on migration: a region when its climate was different may have been a high road for migration, but now be impassable; i shall, however, presently have to discuss this branch of the subject in some detail. changes of level in the land must also have been highly influential: a narrow isthmus now separates two marine faunas; submerge it, or let it formerly have been submerged, and the two faunas will now blend or may formerly have blended: where the sea now extends, land may at a former period have connected islands or possibly even continents together, and thus have allowed terrestrial productions to pass from one to the other. no geologist will dispute that great mutations of level have occurred within the period of existing organisms. edward forbes insisted that all the islands in the atlantic must recently have been connected with europe or africa, and europe likewise with america. other authors have thus hypothetically bridged over every ocean, and have united almost every island to some mainland. if indeed the arguments used by forbes are to be trusted, it must be admitted that scarcely a single island exists which has not recently been united to some continent. this view cuts the gordian knot of the dispersal of the same species to the most distant points, and removes many a difficulty: but to the best of my judgment we are not authorized in admitting such enormous geographical changes within the period of existing species. it seems to me that we have abundant evidence of great oscillations of level in our continents; but not of such vast changes in their position and extension, as to have united them within the recent period to each other and to the several intervening oceanic islands. i freely admit the former existence of many islands, now buried beneath the sea, which may have served as halting places for plants and for many animals during their migration. in the coral-producing oceans such sunken islands are now marked, as i believe, by rings of coral or atolls standing over them. whenever it is fully admitted, as i believe it will some day be, that each species has proceeded from a single birthplace, and when in the course of time we know something definite about the means of distribution, we shall be enabled to speculate with security on the former extension of the land. but i do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the recent period continents which are now quite separate, have been continuously, or almost continuously, united with each other, and with the many existing oceanic islands. several facts in distribution,--such as the great difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost every continent,--the close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands and even seas to their present inhabitants,--a certain degree of relation (as we shall hereafter see) between the distribution of mammals and the depth of the sea,--these and other such facts seem to me opposed to the admission of such prodigious geographical revolutions within the recent period, as are necessitated on the view advanced by forbes and admitted by his many followers. the nature and relative proportions of the inhabitants of oceanic islands likewise seem to me opposed to the belief of their former continuity with continents. nor does their almost universally volcanic composition favour the admission that they are the wrecks of sunken continents;--if they had originally existed as mountain-ranges on the land, some at least of the islands would have been formed, like other mountain-summits, of granite, metamorphic schists, old fossiliferous or other such rocks, instead of consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter. i must now say a few words on what are called accidental means, but which more properly might be called occasional means of distribution. i shall here confine myself to plants. in botanical works, this or that plant is stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination; but for transport across the sea, the greater or less facilities may be said to be almost wholly unknown. until i tried, with mr. berkeley's aid, a few experiments, it was not even known how far seeds could resist the injurious action of sea-water. to my surprise i found that out of 87 kinds, 64 germinated after an immersion of 28 days, and a few survived an immersion of 137 days. for convenience sake i chiefly tried small seeds, without the capsule or fruit; and as all of these sank in a few days, they could not be floated across wide spaces of the sea, whether or not they were injured by the salt-water. afterwards i tried some larger fruits, capsules, etc., and some of these floated for a long time. it is well known what a difference there is in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber; and it occurred to me that floods might wash down plants or branches, and that these might be dried on the banks, and then by a fresh rise in the stream be washed into the sea. hence i was led to dry stems and branches of 94 plants with ripe fruit, and to place them on sea water. the majority sank quickly, but some which whilst green floated for a very short time, when dried floated much longer; for instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when dried, they floated for 90 days and afterwards when planted they germinated; an asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for 23 days, when dried it floated for 85 days, and the seeds afterwards germinated: the ripe seeds of helosciadium sank in two days, when dried they floated for above 90 days, and afterwards germinated. altogether out of the 94 dried plants, 18 floated for above 28 days, and some of the 18 floated for a very much longer period. so that as 64/87 seeds germinated after an immersion of 28 days; and as 18/94 plants with ripe fruit (but not all the same species as in the foregoing experiment) floated, after being dried, for above 28 days, as far as we may infer anything from these scanty facts, we may conclude that the seeds of 14/100 plants of any country might be floated by sea-currents during 28 days, and would retain their power of germination. in johnston's physical atlas, the average rate of the several atlantic currents is 33 miles per diem (some currents running at the rate of 60 miles per diem); on this average, the seeds of 14/100 plants belonging to one country might be floated across 924 miles of sea to another country; and when stranded, if blown to a favourable spot by an inland gale, they would germinate. subsequently to my experiments, m. martens tried similar ones, but in a much better manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea, so that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really floating plants. he tried 98 seeds, mostly different from mine; but he chose many large fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live near the sea; and this would have favoured the average length of their flotation and of their resistance to the injurious action of the salt-water. on the other hand he did not previously dry the plants or branches with the fruit; and this, as we have seen, would have caused some of them to have floated much longer. the result was that 18/98 of his seeds floated for 42 days, and were then capable of germination. but i do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves would float for a less time than those protected from violent movement as in our experiments. therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume that the seeds of about 10/100 plants of a flora, after having been dried, could be floated across a space of sea 900 miles in width, and would then germinate. the fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small, is interesting; as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly be transported by any other means; and alph. de candolle has shown that such plants generally have restricted ranges. but seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner. drift timber is thrown up on most islands, even on those in the midst of the widest oceans; and the natives of the coral-islands in the pacific, procure stones for their tools, solely from the roots of drifted trees, these stones being a valuable royal tax. i find on examination, that when irregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees, small parcels of earth are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind them,--so perfectly that not a particle could be washed away in the longest transport: out of one small portion of earth thus completely enclosed by wood in an oak about 50 years old, three dicotyledonous plants germinated: i am certain of the accuracy of this observation. again, i can show that the carcasses of birds, when floating on the sea, sometimes escape being immediately devoured; and seeds of many kinds in the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality: peas and vetches, for instance, are killed by even a few days' immersion in sea-water; but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon, which had floated on artificial salt-water for 30 days, to my surprise nearly all germinated. living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the transportation of seeds. i could give many facts showing how frequently birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the ocean. we may i think safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of flight would often be 35 miles an hour; and some authors have given a far higher estimate. i have never seen an instance of nutritious seeds passing through the intestines of a bird; but hard seeds of fruit will pass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a turkey. in the course of two months, i picked up in my garden 12 kinds of seeds, out of the excrement of small birds, and these seemed perfect, and some of them, which i tried, germinated. but the following fact is more important: the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice, and do not in the least injure, as i know by trial, the germination of seeds; now after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of food, it is positively asserted that all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for 12 or even 18 hours. a bird in this interval might easily be blown to the distance of 500 miles, and hawks are known to look out for tired birds, and the contents of their torn crops might thus readily get scattered. mr. brent informs me that a friend of his had to give up flying carrier-pigeons from france to england, as the hawks on the english coast destroyed so many on their arrival. some hawks and owls bolt their prey whole, and after an interval of from twelve to twenty hours, disgorge pellets, which, as i know from experiments made in the zoological gardens, include seeds capable of germination. some seeds of the oat, wheat, millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet germinated after having been from twelve to twenty-one hours in the stomachs of different birds of prey; and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus retained for two days and fourteen hours. freshwater fish, i find, eat seeds of many land and water plants: fish are frequently devoured by birds, and thus the seeds might be transported from place to place. i forced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish, and then gave their bodies to fishing-eagles, storks, and pelicans; these birds after an interval of many hours, either rejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their excrement; and several of these seeds retained their power of germination. certain seeds, however, were always killed by this process. although the beaks and feet of birds are generally quite clean, i can show that earth sometimes adheres to them: in one instance i removed twenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth from one foot of a partridge, and in this earth there was a pebble quite as large as the seed of a vetch. thus seeds might occasionally be transported to great distances; for many facts could be given showing that soil almost everywhere is charged with seeds. reflect for a moment on the millions of quails which annually cross the mediterranean; and can we doubt that the earth adhering to their feet would sometimes include a few minute seeds? but i shall presently have to recur to this subject. as icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones, and have even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a land-bird, i can hardly doubt that they must occasionally have transported seeds from one part to another of the arctic and antarctic regions, as suggested by lyell; and during the glacial period from one part of the now temperate regions to another. in the azores, from the large number of the species of plants common to europe, in comparison with the plants of other oceanic islands nearer to the mainland, and (as remarked by mr. h. c. watson) from the somewhat northern character of the flora in comparison with the latitude, i suspected that these islands had been partly stocked by ice-borne seeds, during the glacial epoch. at my request sir c. lyell wrote to m. hartung to inquire whether he had observed erratic boulders on these islands, and he answered that he had found large fragments of granite and other rocks, which do not occur in the archipelago. hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly landed their rocky burthens on the shores of these mid-ocean islands, and it is at least possible that they may have brought thither the seeds of northern plants. considering that the several above means of transport, and that several other means, which without doubt remain to be discovered, have been in action year after year, for centuries and tens of thousands of years, it would i think be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thus become widely transported. these means of transport are sometimes called accidental, but this is not strictly correct: the currents of the sea are not accidental, nor is the direction of prevalent gales of wind. it should be observed that scarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very great distances; for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a great length of time to the action of seawater; nor could they be long carried in the crops or intestines of birds. these means, however, would suffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred miles in breadth, or from island to island, or from a continent to a neighbouring island, but not from one distant continent to another. the floras of distant continents would not by such means become mingled in any great degree; but would remain as distinct as we now see them to be. the currents, from their course, would never bring seeds from north america to britain, though they might and do bring seeds from the west indies to our western shores, where, if not killed by so long an immersion in salt-water, they could not endure our climate. almost every year, one or two land-birds are blown across the whole atlantic ocean, from north america to the western shores of ireland and england; but seeds could be transported by these wanderers only by one means, namely, in dirt sticking to their feet, which is in itself a rare accident. even in this case, how small would the chance be of a seed falling on favourable soil, and coming to maturity! but it would be a great error to argue that because a well-stocked island, like great britain, has not, as far as is known (and it would be very difficult to prove this), received within the last few centuries, through occasional means of transport, immigrants from europe or any other continent, that a poorly-stocked island, though standing more remote from the mainland, would not receive colonists by similar means. i do not doubt that out of twenty seeds or animals transported to an island, even if far less well-stocked than britain, scarcely more than one would be so well fitted to its new home, as to become naturalised. but this, as it seems to me, is no valid argument against what would be effected by occasional means of transport, during the long lapse of geological time, whilst an island was being upheaved and formed, and before it had become fully stocked with inhabitants. on almost bare land, with few or no destructive insects or birds living there, nearly every seed, which chanced to arrive, would be sure to germinate and survive. dispersal during the glacial period. the identity of many plants and animals, on mountain-summits, separated from each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands, where the alpine species could not possibly exist, is one of the most striking cases known of the same species living at distant points, without the apparent possibility of their having migrated from one to the other. it is indeed a remarkable fact to see so many of the same plants living on the snowy regions of the alps or pyrenees, and in the extreme northern parts of europe; but it is far more remarkable, that the plants on the white mountains, in the united states of america, are all the same with those of labrador, and nearly all the same, as we hear from asa gray, with those on the loftiest mountains of europe. even as long ago as 1747, such facts led gmelin to conclude that the same species must have been independently created at several distinct points; and we might have remained in this same belief, had not agassiz and others called vivid attention to the glacial period, which, as we shall immediately see, affords a simple explanation of these facts. we have evidence of almost every conceivable kind, organic and inorganic, that within a very recent geological period, central europe and north america suffered under an arctic climate. the ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell their tale more plainly, than do the mountains of scotland and wales, with their scored flanks, polished surfaces, and perched boulders, of the icy streams with which their valleys were lately filled. so greatly has the climate of europe changed, that in northern italy, gigantic moraines, left by old glaciers, are now clothed by the vine and maize. throughout a large part of the united states, erratic boulders, and rocks scored by drifted icebergs and coast-ice, plainly reveal a former cold period. the former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the inhabitants of europe, as explained with remarkable clearness by edward forbes, is substantially as follows. but we shall follow the changes more readily, by supposing a new glacial period to come slowly on, and then pass away, as formerly occurred. as the cold came on, and as each more southern zone became fitted for arctic beings and ill-fitted for their former more temperate inhabitants, the latter would be supplanted and arctic productions would take their places. the inhabitants of the more temperate regions would at the same time travel southward, unless they were stopped by barriers, in which case they would perish. the mountains would become covered with snow and ice, and their former alpine inhabitants would descend to the plains. by the time that the cold had reached its maximum, we should have a uniform arctic fauna and flora, covering the central parts of europe, as far south as the alps and pyrenees, and even stretching into spain. the now temperate regions of the united states would likewise be covered by arctic plants and animals, and these would be nearly the same with those of europe; for the present circumpolar inhabitants, which we suppose to have everywhere travelled southward, are remarkably uniform round the world. we may suppose that the glacial period came on a little earlier or later in north america than in europe, so will the southern migration there have been a little earlier or later; but this will make no difference in the final result. as the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat northward, closely followed up in their retreat by the productions of the more temperate regions. and as the snow melted from the bases of the mountains, the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed ground, always ascending higher and higher, as the warmth increased, whilst their brethren were pursuing their northern journey. hence, when the warmth had fully returned, the same arctic species, which had lately lived in a body together on the lowlands of the old and new worlds, would be left isolated on distant mountain-summits (having been exterminated on all lesser heights) and in the arctic regions of both hemispheres. thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so immensely remote as on the mountains of the united states and of europe. we can thus also understand the fact that the alpine plants of each mountain-range are more especially related to the arctic forms living due north or nearly due north of them: for the migration as the cold came on, and the re-migration on the returning warmth, will generally have been due south and north. the alpine plants, for example, of scotland, as remarked by mr. h. c. watson, and those of the pyrenees, as remarked by ramond, are more especially allied to the plants of northern scandinavia; those of the united states to labrador; those of the mountains of siberia to the arctic regions of that country. these views, grounded as they are on the perfectly well-ascertained occurrence of a former glacial period, seem to me to explain in so satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the alpine and arctic productions of europe and america, that when in other regions we find the same species on distant mountain-summits, we may almost conclude without other evidence, that a colder climate permitted their former migration across the low intervening tracts, since become too warm for their existence. if the climate, since the glacial period, has ever been in any degree warmer than at present (as some geologists in the united states believe to have been the case, chiefly from the distribution of the fossil gnathodon), then the arctic and temperate productions will at a very late period have marched a little further north, and subsequently have retreated to their present homes; but i have met with no satisfactory evidence with respect to this intercalated slightly warmer period, since the glacial period. the arctic forms, during their long southern migration and re-migration northward, will have been exposed to nearly the same climate, and, as is especially to be noticed, they will have kept in a body together; consequently their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed, and, in accordance with the principles inculcated in this volume, they will not have been liable to much modification. but with our alpine productions, left isolated from the moment of the returning warmth, first at the bases and ultimately on the summits of the mountains, the case will have been somewhat different; for it is not likely that all the same arctic species will have been left on mountain ranges distant from each other, and have survived there ever since; they will, also, in all probability have become mingled with ancient alpine species, which must have existed on the mountains before the commencement of the glacial epoch, and which during its coldest period will have been temporarily driven down to the plains; they will, also, have been exposed to somewhat different climatal influences. their mutual relations will thus have been in some degree disturbed; consequently they will have been liable to modification; and this we find has been the case; for if we compare the present alpine plants and animals of the several great european mountain-ranges, though very many of the species are identically the same, some present varieties, some are ranked as doubtful forms, and some few are distinct yet closely allied or representative species. in illustrating what, as i believe, actually took place during the glacial period, i assumed that at its commencement the arctic productions were as uniform round the polar regions as they are at the present day. but the foregoing remarks on distribution apply not only to strictly arctic forms, but also to many sub-arctic and to some few northern temperate forms, for some of these are the same on the lower mountains and on the plains of north america and europe; and it may be reasonably asked how i account for the necessary degree of uniformity of the sub-arctic and northern temperate forms round the world, at the commencement of the glacial period. at the present day, the sub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the old and new worlds are separated from each other by the atlantic ocean and by the extreme northern part of the pacific. during the glacial period, when the inhabitants of the old and new worlds lived further southwards than at present, they must have been still more completely separated by wider spaces of ocean. i believe the above difficulty may be surmounted by looking to still earlier changes of climate of an opposite nature. we have good reason to believe that during the newer pliocene period, before the glacial epoch, and whilst the majority of the inhabitants of the world were specifically the same as now, the climate was warmer than at the present day. hence we may suppose that the organisms now living under the climate of latitude 60 deg, during the pliocene period lived further north under the polar circle, in latitude 66 deg-67 deg; and that the strictly arctic productions then lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole. now if we look at a globe, we shall see that under the polar circle there is almost continuous land from western europe, through siberia, to eastern america. and to this continuity of the circumpolar land, and to the consequent freedom for intermigration under a more favourable climate, i attribute the necessary amount of uniformity in the sub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the old and new worlds, at a period anterior to the glacial epoch. believing, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents have long remained in nearly the same relative position, though subjected to large, but partial oscillations of level, i am strongly inclined to extend the above view, and to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period, such as the older pliocene period, a large number of the same plants and animals inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land; and that these plants and animals, both in the old and new worlds, began slowly to migrate southwards as the climate became less warm, long before the commencement of the glacial period. we now see, as i believe, their descendants, mostly in a modified condition, in the central parts of europe and the united states. on this view we can understand the relationship, with very little identity, between the productions of north america and europe,--a relationship which is most remarkable, considering the distance of the two areas, and their separation by the atlantic ocean. we can further understand the singular fact remarked on by several observers, that the productions of europe and america during the later tertiary stages were more closely related to each other than they are at the present time; for during these warmer periods the northern parts of the old and new worlds will have been almost continuously united by land, serving as a bridge, since rendered impassable by cold, for the inter-migration of their inhabitants. during the slowly decreasing warmth of the pliocene period, as soon as the species in common, which inhabited the new and old worlds, migrated south of the polar circle, they must have been completely cut off from each other. this separation, as far as the more temperate productions are concerned, took place long ages ago. and as the plants and animals migrated southward, they will have become mingled in the one great region with the native american productions, and have had to compete with them; and in the other great region, with those of the old world. consequently we have here everything favourable for much modification,--for far more modification than with the alpine productions, left isolated, within a much more recent period, on the several mountain-ranges and on the arctic lands of the two worlds. hence it has come, that when we compare the now living productions of the temperate regions of the new and old worlds, we find very few identical species (though asa gray has lately shown that more plants are identical than was formerly supposed), but we find in every great class many forms, which some naturalists rank as geographical races, and others as distinct species; and a host of closely allied or representative forms which are ranked by all naturalists as specifically distinct. as on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern migration of a marine fauna, which during the pliocene or even a somewhat earlier period, was nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the polar circle, will account, on the theory of modification, for many closely allied forms now living in areas completely sundered. thus, i think, we can understand the presence of many existing and tertiary representative forms on the eastern and western shores of temperate north america; and the still more striking case of many closely allied crustaceans (as described in dana's admirable work), of some fish and other marine animals, in the mediterranean and in the seas of japan,--areas now separated by a continent and by nearly a hemisphere of equatorial ocean. these cases of relationship, without identity, of the inhabitants of seas now disjoined, and likewise of the past and present inhabitants of the temperate lands of north america and europe, are inexplicable on the theory of creation. we cannot say that they have been created alike, in correspondence with the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas; for if we compare, for instance, certain parts of south america with the southern continents of the old world, we see countries closely corresponding in all their physical conditions, but with their inhabitants utterly dissimilar. but we must return to our more immediate subject, the glacial period. i am convinced that forbes's view may be largely extended. in europe we have the plainest evidence of the cold period, from the western shores of britain to the oural range, and southward to the pyrenees. we may infer, from the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation, that siberia was similarly affected. along the himalaya, at points 900 miles apart, glaciers have left the marks of their former low descent; and in sikkim, dr. hooker saw maize growing on gigantic ancient moraines. south of the equator, we have some direct evidence of former glacial action in new zealand; and the same plants, found on widely separated mountains in this island, tell the same story. if one account which has been published can be trusted, we have direct evidence of glacial action in the south-eastern corner of australia. looking to america; in the northern half, ice-borne fragments of rock have been observed on the eastern side as far south as lat. 36 deg-37 deg, and on the shores of the pacific, where the climate is now so different, as far south as lat. 46 deg; erratic boulders have, also, been noticed on the rocky mountains. in the cordillera of equatorial south america, glaciers once extended far below their present level. in central chile i was astonished at the structure of a vast mound of detritus, about 800 feet in height, crossing a valley of the andes; and this i now feel convinced was a gigantic moraine, left far below any existing glacier. further south on both sides of the continent, from lat. 41 deg to the southernmost extremity, we have the clearest evidence of former glacial action, in huge boulders transported far from their parent source. we do not know that the glacial epoch was strictly simultaneous at these several far distant points on opposite sides of the world. but we have good evidence in almost every case, that the epoch was included within the latest geological period. we have, also, excellent evidence, that it endured for an enormous time, as measured by years, at each point. the cold may have come on, or have ceased, earlier at one point of the globe than at another, but seeing that it endured for long at each, and that it was contemporaneous in a geological sense, it seems to me probable that it was, during a part at least of the period, actually simultaneous throughout the world. without some distinct evidence to the contrary, we may at least admit as probable that the glacial action was simultaneous on the eastern and western sides of north america, in the cordillera under the equator and under the warmer temperate zones, and on both sides of the southern extremity of the continent. if this be admitted, it is difficult to avoid believing that the temperature of the whole world was at this period simultaneously cooler. but it would suffice for my purpose, if the temperature was at the same time lower along certain broad belts of longitude. on this view of the whole world, or at least of broad longitudinal belts, having been simultaneously colder from pole to pole, much light can be thrown on the present distribution of identical and allied species. in america, dr. hooker has shown that between forty and fifty of the flowering plants of tierra del fuego, forming no inconsiderable part of its scanty flora, are common to europe, enormously remote as these two points are; and there are many closely allied species. on the lofty mountains of equatorial america a host of peculiar species belonging to european genera occur. on the highest mountains of brazil, some few european genera were found by gardner, which do not exist in the wide intervening hot countries. so on the silla of caraccas the illustrious humboldt long ago found species belonging to genera characteristic of the cordillera. on the mountains of abyssinia, several european forms and some few representatives of the peculiar flora of the cape of good hope occur. at the cape of good hope a very few european species, believed not to have been introduced by man, and on the mountains, some few representative european forms are found, which have not been discovered in the intertropical parts of africa. on the himalaya, and on the isolated mountain-ranges of the peninsula of india, on the heights of ceylon, and on the volcanic cones of java, many plants occur, either identically the same or representing each other, and at the same time representing plants of europe, not found in the intervening hot lowlands. a list of the genera collected on the loftier peaks of java raises a picture of a collection made on a hill in europe! still more striking is the fact that southern australian forms are clearly represented by plants growing on the summits of the mountains of borneo. some of these australian forms, as i hear from dr. hooker, extend along the heights of the peninsula of malacca, and are thinly scattered, on the one hand over india and on the other as far north as japan. on the southern mountains of australia, dr. f. muller has discovered several european species; other species, not introduced by man, occur on the lowlands; and a long list can be given, as i am informed by dr. hooker, of european genera, found in australia, but not in the intermediate torrid regions. in the admirable 'introduction to the flora of new zealand,' by dr. hooker, analogous and striking facts are given in regard to the plants of that large island. hence we see that throughout the world, the plants growing on the more lofty mountains, and on the temperate lowlands of the northern and southern hemispheres, are sometimes identically the same; but they are much oftener specifically distinct, though related to each other in a most remarkable manner. this brief abstract applies to plants alone: some strictly analogous facts could be given on the distribution of terrestrial animals. in marine productions, similar cases occur; as an example, i may quote a remark by the highest authority, professor dana, that "it is certainly a wonderful fact that new zealand should have a closer resemblance in its crustacea to great britain, its antipode, than to any other part of the world." sir j. richardson, also, speaks of the reappearance on the shores of new zealand, tasmania, etc., of northern forms of fish. dr. hooker informs me that twenty-five species of algae are common to new zealand and to europe, but have not been found in the intermediate tropical seas. it should be observed that the northern species and forms found in the southern parts of the southern hemisphere, and on the mountain-ranges of the intertropical regions, are not arctic, but belong to the northern temperate zones. as mr. h. c. watson has recently remarked, "in receding from polar towards equatorial latitudes, the alpine or mountain floras really become less and less arctic." many of the forms living on the mountains of the warmer regions of the earth and in the southern hemisphere are of doubtful value, being ranked by some naturalists as specifically distinct, by others as varieties; but some are certainly identical, and many, though closely related to northern forms, must be ranked as distinct species. now let us see what light can be thrown on the foregoing facts, on the belief, supported as it is by a large body of geological evidence, that the whole world, or a large part of it, was during the glacial period simultaneously much colder than at present. the glacial period, as measured by years, must have been very long; and when we remember over what vast spaces some naturalised plants and animals have spread within a few centuries, this period will have been ample for any amount of migration. as the cold came slowly on, all the tropical plants and other productions will have retreated from both sides towards the equator, followed in the rear by the temperate productions, and these by the arctic; but with the latter we are not now concerned. the tropical plants probably suffered much extinction; how much no one can say; perhaps formerly the tropics supported as many species as we see at the present day crowded together at the cape of good hope, and in parts of temperate australia. as we know that many tropical plants and animals can withstand a considerable amount of cold, many might have escaped extermination during a moderate fall of temperature, more especially by escaping into the warmest spots. but the great fact to bear in mind is, that all tropical productions will have suffered to a certain extent. on the other hand, the temperate productions, after migrating nearer to the equator, though they will have been placed under somewhat new conditions, will have suffered less. and it is certain that many temperate plants, if protected from the inroads of competitors, can withstand a much warmer climate than their own. hence, it seems to me possible, bearing in mind that the tropical productions were in a suffering state and could not have presented a firm front against intruders, that a certain number of the more vigorous and dominant temperate forms might have penetrated the native ranks and have reached or even crossed the equator. the invasion would, of course, have been greatly favoured by high land, and perhaps by a dry climate; for dr. falconer informs me that it is the damp with the heat of the tropics which is so destructive to perennial plants from a temperate climate. on the other hand, the most humid and hottest districts will have afforded an asylum to the tropical natives. the mountain-ranges north-west of the himalaya, and the long line of the cordillera, seem to have afforded two great lines of invasion: and it is a striking fact, lately communicated to me by dr. hooker, that all the flowering plants, about forty-six in number, common to tierra del fuego and to europe still exist in north america, which must have lain on the line of march. but i do not doubt that some temperate productions entered and crossed even the lowlands of the tropics at the period when the cold was most intense,--when arctic forms had migrated some twenty-five degrees of latitude from their native country and covered the land at the foot of the pyrenees. at this period of extreme cold, i believe that the climate under the equator at the level of the sea was about the same with that now felt there at the height of six or seven thousand feet. during this the coldest period, i suppose that large spaces of the tropical lowlands were clothed with a mingled tropical and temperate vegetation, like that now growing with strange luxuriance at the base of the himalaya, as graphically described by hooker. thus, as i believe, a considerable number of plants, a few terrestrial animals, and some marine productions, migrated during the glacial period from the northern and southern temperate zones into the intertropical regions, and some even crossed the equator. as the warmth returned, these temperate forms would naturally ascend the higher mountains, being exterminated on the lowlands; those which had not reached the equator, would re-migrate northward or southward towards their former homes; but the forms, chiefly northern, which had crossed the equator, would travel still further from their homes into the more temperate latitudes of the opposite hemisphere. although we have reason to believe from geological evidence that the whole body of arctic shells underwent scarcely any modification during their long southern migration and re-migration northward, the case may have been wholly different with those intruding forms which settled themselves on the intertropical mountains, and in the southern hemisphere. these being surrounded by strangers will have had to compete with many new forms of life; and it is probable that selected modifications in their structure, habits, and constitutions will have profited them. thus many of these wanderers, though still plainly related by inheritance to their brethren of the northern or southern hemispheres, now exist in their new homes as well-marked varieties or as distinct species. it is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by hooker in regard to america, and by alph. de candolle in regard to australia, that many more identical plants and allied forms have apparently migrated from the north to the south, than in a reversed direction. we see, however, a few southern vegetable forms on the mountains of borneo and abyssinia. i suspect that this preponderant migration from north to south is due to the greater extent of land in the north, and to the northern forms having existed in their own homes in greater numbers, and having consequently been advanced through natural selection and competition to a higher stage of perfection or dominating power, than the southern forms. and thus, when they became commingled during the glacial period, the northern forms were enabled to beat the less powerful southern forms. just in the same manner as we see at the present day, that very many european productions cover the ground in la plata, and in a lesser degree in australia, and have to a certain extent beaten the natives; whereas extremely few southern forms have become naturalised in any part of europe, though hides, wool, and other objects likely to carry seeds have been largely imported into europe during the last two or three centuries from la plata, and during the last thirty or forty years from australia. something of the same kind must have occurred on the intertropical mountains: no doubt before the glacial period they were stocked with endemic alpine forms; but these have almost everywhere largely yielded to the more dominant forms, generated in the larger areas and more efficient workshops of the north. in many islands the native productions are nearly equalled or even outnumbered by the naturalised; and if the natives have not been actually exterminated, their numbers have been greatly reduced, and this is the first stage towards extinction. a mountain is an island on the land; and the intertropical mountains before the glacial period must have been completely isolated; and i believe that the productions of these islands on the land yielded to those produced within the larger areas of the north, just in the same way as the productions of real islands have everywhere lately yielded to continental forms, naturalised by man's agency. i am far from supposing that all difficulties are removed on the view here given in regard to the range and affinities of the allied species which live in the northern and southern temperate zones and on the mountains of the intertropical regions. very many difficulties remain to be solved. i do not pretend to indicate the exact lines and means of migration, or the reason why certain species and not others have migrated; why certain species have been modified and have given rise to new groups of forms, and others have remained unaltered. we cannot hope to explain such facts, until we can say why one species and not another becomes naturalised by man's agency in a foreign land; why one ranges twice or thrice as far, and is twice or thrice as common, as another species within their own homes. i have said that many difficulties remain to be solved: some of the most remarkable are stated with admirable clearness by dr. hooker in his botanical works on the antarctic regions. these cannot be here discussed. i will only say that as far as regards the occurrence of identical species at points so enormously remote as kerguelen land, new zealand, and fuegia, i believe that towards the close of the glacial period, icebergs, as suggested by lyell, have been largely concerned in their dispersal. but the existence of several quite distinct species, belonging to genera exclusively confined to the south, at these and other distant points of the southern hemisphere, is, on my theory of descent with modification, a far more remarkable case of difficulty. for some of these species are so distinct, that we cannot suppose that there has been time since the commencement of the glacial period for their migration, and for their subsequent modification to the necessary degree. the facts seem to me to indicate that peculiar and very distinct species have migrated in radiating lines from some common centre; and i am inclined to look in the southern, as in the northern hemisphere, to a former and warmer period, before the commencement of the glacial period, when the antarctic lands, now covered with ice, supported a highly peculiar and isolated flora. i suspect that before this flora was exterminated by the glacial epoch, a few forms were widely dispersed to various points of the southern hemisphere by occasional means of transport, and by the aid, as halting-places, of existing and now sunken islands, and perhaps at the commencement of the glacial period, by icebergs. by these means, as i believe, the southern shores of america, australia, new zealand have become slightly tinted by the same peculiar forms of vegetable life. sir c. lyell in a striking passage has speculated, in language almost identical with mine, on the effects of great alternations of climate on geographical distribution. i believe that the world has recently felt one of his great cycles of change; and that on this view, combined with modification through natural selection, a multitude of facts in the present distribution both of the same and of allied forms of life can be explained. the living waters may be said to have flowed during one short period from the north and from the south, and to have crossed at the equator; but to have flowed with greater force from the north so as to have freely inundated the south. as the tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines, though rising higher on the shores where the tide rises highest, so have the living waters left their living drift on our mountain-summits, in a line gently rising from the arctic lowlands to a great height under the equator. the various beings thus left stranded may be compared with savage races of man, driven up and surviving in the mountain-fastnesses of almost every land, which serve as a record, full of interest to us, of the former inhabitants of the surrounding lowlands. 12. geographical distribution--continued. distribution of fresh-water productions. on the inhabitants of oceanic islands. absence of batrachians and of terrestrial mammals. on the relation of the inhabitants of islands to those of the nearest mainland. on colonisation from the nearest source with subsequent modification. summary of the last and present chapters. as lakes and river-systems are separated from each other by barriers of land, it might have been thought that fresh-water productions would not have ranged widely within the same country, and as the sea is apparently a still more impassable barrier, that they never would have extended to distant countries. but the case is exactly the reverse. not only have many fresh-water species, belonging to quite different classes, an enormous range, but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner throughout the world. i well remember, when first collecting in the fresh waters of brazil, feeling much surprise at the similarity of the fresh-water insects, shells, etc., and at the dissimilarity of the surrounding terrestrial beings, compared with those of britain. but this power in fresh-water productions of ranging widely, though so unexpected, can, i think, in most cases be explained by their having become fitted, in a manner highly useful to them, for short and frequent migrations from pond to pond, or from stream to stream; and liability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary consequence. we can here consider only a few cases. in regard to fish, i believe that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of distant continents. but on the same continent the species often range widely and almost capriciously; for two river-systems will have some fish in common and some different. a few facts seem to favour the possibility of their occasional transport by accidental means; like that of the live fish not rarely dropped by whirlwinds in india, and the vitality of their ova when removed from the water. but i am inclined to attribute the dispersal of fresh-water fish mainly to slight changes within the recent period in the level of the land, having caused rivers to flow into each other. instances, also, could be given of this having occurred during floods, without any change of level. we have evidence in the loess of the rhine of considerable changes of level in the land within a very recent geological period, and when the surface was peopled by existing land and fresh-water shells. the wide difference of the fish on opposite sides of continuous mountain-ranges, which from an early period must have parted river-systems and completely prevented their inosculation, seems to lead to this same conclusion. with respect to allied fresh-water fish occurring at very distant points of the world, no doubt there are many cases which cannot at present be explained: but some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical changes, and consequently time and means for much migration. in the second place, salt-water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and, according to valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of fishes confined exclusively to fresh water, so that we may imagine that a marine member of a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores of the sea, and subsequently become modified and adapted to the fresh waters of a distant land. some species of fresh-water shells have a very wide range, and allied species, which, on my theory, are descended from a common parent and must have proceeded from a single source, prevail throughout the world. their distribution at first perplexed me much, as their ova are not likely to be transported by birds, and they are immediately killed by sea water, as are the adults. i could not even understand how some naturalised species have rapidly spread throughout the same country. but two facts, which i have observed--and no doubt many others remain to be observed--throw some light on this subject. when a duck suddenly emerges from a pond covered with duck-weed, i have twice seen these little plants adhering to its back; and it has happened to me, in removing a little duck-weed from one aquarium to another, that i have quite unintentionally stocked the one with fresh-water shells from the other. but another agency is perhaps more effectual: i suspended a duck's feet, which might represent those of a bird sleeping in a natural pond, in an aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were hatching; and i found that numbers of the extremely minute and just hatched shells crawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out of the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more advanced age they would voluntarily drop off. these just hatched molluscs, though aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck's feet, in damp air, from twelve to twenty hours; and in this length of time a duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and would be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet, if blown across sea to an oceanic island or to any other distant point. sir charles lyell also informs me that a dyticus has been caught with an ancylus (a fresh-water shell like a limpet) firmly adhering to it; and a water-beetle of the same family, a colymbetes, once flew on board the 'beagle,' when forty-five miles distant from the nearest land: how much farther it might have flown with a favouring gale no one can tell. with respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous ranges many fresh-water and even marsh-species have, both over continents and to the most remote oceanic islands. this is strikingly shown, as remarked by alph. de candolle, in large groups of terrestrial plants, which have only a very few aquatic members; for these latter seem immediately to acquire, as if in consequence, a very wide range. i think favourable means of dispersal explain this fact. i have before mentioned that earth occasionally, though rarely, adheres in some quantity to the feet and beaks of birds. wading birds, which frequent the muddy edges of ponds, if suddenly flushed, would be the most likely to have muddy feet. birds of this order i can show are the greatest wanderers, and are occasionally found on the most remote and barren islands in the open ocean; they would not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea, so that the dirt would not be washed off their feet; when making land, they would be sure to fly to their natural fresh-water haunts. i do not believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud of ponds is with seeds: i have tried several little experiments, but will here give only the most striking case: i took in february three table-spoonfuls of mud from three different points, beneath water, on the edge of a little pond; this mud when dry weighed only 6 3/4 ounces; i kept it covered up in my study for six months, pulling up and counting each plant as it grew; the plants were of many kinds, and were altogether 537 in number; and yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup! considering these facts, i think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if water-birds did not transport the seeds of fresh-water plants to vast distances, and if consequently the range of these plants was not very great. the same agency may have come into play with the eggs of some of the smaller fresh-water animals. other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part. i have stated that fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though they reject many other kinds after having swallowed them; even small fish swallow seeds of moderate size, as of the yellow water-lily and potamogeton. herons and other birds, century after century, have gone on daily devouring fish; they then take flight and go to other waters, or are blown across the sea; and we have seen that seeds retain their power of germination, when rejected in pellets or in excrement, many hours afterwards. when i saw the great size of the seeds of that fine water-lily, the nelumbium, and remembered alph. de candolle's remarks on this plant, i thought that its distribution must remain quite inexplicable; but audubon states that he found the seeds of the great southern water-lily (probably, according to dr. hooker, the nelumbium luteum) in a heron's stomach; although i do not know the fact, yet analogy makes me believe that a heron flying to another pond and getting a hearty meal of fish, would probably reject from its stomach a pellet containing the seeds of the nelumbium undigested; or the seeds might be dropped by the bird whilst feeding its young, in the same way as fish are known sometimes to be dropped. in considering these several means of distribution, it should be remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance, on a rising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg will have a good chance of succeeding. although there will always be a struggle for life between the individuals of the species, however few, already occupying any pond, yet as the number of kinds is small, compared with those on the land, the competition will probably be less severe between aquatic than between terrestrial species; consequently an intruder from the waters of a foreign country, would have a better chance of seizing on a place, than in the case of terrestrial colonists. we should, also, remember that some, perhaps many, fresh-water productions are low in the scale of nature, and that we have reason to believe that such low beings change or become modified less quickly than the high; and this will give longer time than the average for the migration of the same aquatic species. we should not forget the probability of many species having formerly ranged as continuously as fresh-water productions ever can range, over immense areas, and having subsequently become extinct in intermediate regions. but the wide distribution of fresh-water plants and of the lower animals, whether retaining the same identical form or in some degree modified, i believe mainly depends on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals, more especially by fresh-water birds, which have large powers of flight, and naturally travel from one to another and often distant piece of water. nature, like a careful gardener, thus takes her seeds from a bed of a particular nature, and drops them in another equally well fitted for them. on the inhabitants of oceanic islands. we now come to the last of the three classes of facts, which i have selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty, on the view that all the individuals both of the same and of allied species have descended from a single parent; and therefore have all proceeded from a common birthplace, notwithstanding that in the course of time they have come to inhabit distant points of the globe. i have already stated that i cannot honestly admit forbes's view on continental extensions, which, if legitimately followed out, would lead to the belief that within the recent period all existing islands have been nearly or quite joined to some continent. this view would remove many difficulties, but it would not, i think, explain all the facts in regard to insular productions. in the following remarks i shall not confine myself to the mere question of dispersal; but shall consider some other facts, which bear on the truth of the two theories of independent creation and of descent with modification. the species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in number compared with those on equal continental areas: alph. de candolle admits this for plants, and wollaston for insects. if we look to the large size and varied stations of new zealand, extending over 780 miles of latitude, and compare its flowering plants, only 750 in number, with those on an equal area at the cape of good hope or in australia, we must, i think, admit that something quite independently of any difference in physical conditions has caused so great a difference in number. even the uniform county of cambridge has 847 plants, and the little island of anglesea 764, but a few ferns and a few introduced plants are included in these numbers, and the comparison in some other respects is not quite fair. we have evidence that the barren island of ascension aboriginally possessed under half-a-dozen flowering plants; yet many have become naturalised on it, as they have on new zealand and on every other oceanic island which can be named. in st. helena there is reason to believe that the naturalised plants and animals have nearly or quite exterminated many native productions. he who admits the doctrine of the creation of each separate species, will have to admit, that a sufficient number of the best adapted plants and animals have not been created on oceanic islands; for man has unintentionally stocked them from various sources far more fully and perfectly than has nature. although in oceanic islands the number of kinds of inhabitants is scanty, the proportion of endemic species (i.e. those found nowhere else in the world) is often extremely large. if we compare, for instance, the number of the endemic land-shells in madeira, or of the endemic birds in the galapagos archipelago, with the number found on any continent, and then compare the area of the islands with that of the continent, we shall see that this is true. this fact might have been expected on my theory, for, as already explained, species occasionally arriving after long intervals in a new and isolated district, and having to compete with new associates, will be eminently liable to modification, and will often produce groups of modified descendants. but it by no means follows, that, because in an island nearly all the species of one class are peculiar, those of another class, or of another section of the same class, are peculiar; and this difference seems to depend on the species which do not become modified having immigrated with facility and in a body, so that their mutual relations have not been much disturbed. thus in the galapagos islands nearly every land-bird, but only two out of the eleven marine birds, are peculiar; and it is obvious that marine birds could arrive at these islands more easily than land-birds. bermuda, on the other hand, which lies at about the same distance from north america as the galapagos islands do from south america, and which has a very peculiar soil, does not possess one endemic land bird; and we know from mr. j. m. jones's admirable account of bermuda, that very many north american birds, during their great annual migrations, visit either periodically or occasionally this island. madeira does not possess one peculiar bird, and many european and african birds are almost every year blown there, as i am informed by mr. e. v. harcourt. so that these two islands of bermuda and madeira have been stocked by birds, which for long ages have struggled together in their former homes, and have become mutually adapted to each other; and when settled in their new homes, each kind will have been kept by the others to their proper places and habits, and will consequently have been little liable to modification. madeira, again, is inhabited by a wonderful number of peculiar land-shells, whereas not one species of sea-shell is confined to its shores: now, though we do not know how seashells are dispersed, yet we can see that their eggs or larvae, perhaps attached to seaweed or floating timber, or to the feet of wading-birds, might be transported far more easily than land-shells, across three or four hundred miles of open sea. the different orders of insects in madeira apparently present analogous facts. oceanic islands are sometimes deficient in certain classes, and their places are apparently occupied by the other inhabitants; in the galapagos islands reptiles, and in new zealand gigantic wingless birds, take the place of mammals. in the plants of the galapagos islands, dr. hooker has shown that the proportional numbers of the different orders are very different from what they are elsewhere. such cases are generally accounted for by the physical conditions of the islands; but this explanation seems to me not a little doubtful. facility of immigration, i believe, has been at least as important as the nature of the conditions. many remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of remote islands. for instance, in certain islands not tenanted by mammals, some of the endemic plants have beautifully hooked seeds; yet few relations are more striking than the adaptation of hooked seeds for transportal by the wool and fur of quadrupeds. this case presents no difficulty on my view, for a hooked seed might be transported to an island by some other means; and the plant then becoming slightly modified, but still retaining its hooked seeds, would form an endemic species, having as useless an appendage as any rudimentary organ,--for instance, as the shrivelled wings under the soldered elytra of many insular beetles. again, islands often possess trees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere include only herbaceous species; now trees, as alph. de candolle has shown, generally have, whatever the cause may be, confined ranges. hence trees would be little likely to reach distant oceanic islands; and an herbaceous plant, though it would have no chance of successfully competing in stature with a fully developed tree, when established on an island and having to compete with herbaceous plants alone, might readily gain an advantage by growing taller and taller and overtopping the other plants. if so, natural selection would often tend to add to the stature of herbaceous plants when growing on an island, to whatever order they belonged, and thus convert them first into bushes and ultimately into trees. with respect to the absence of whole orders on oceanic islands, bory st. vincent long ago remarked that batrachians (frogs, toads, newts) have never been found on any of the many islands with which the great oceans are studded. i have taken pains to verify this assertion, and i have found it strictly true. i have, however, been assured that a frog exists on the mountains of the great island of new zealand; but i suspect that this exception (if the information be correct) may be explained through glacial agency. this general absence of frogs, toads, and newts on so many oceanic islands cannot be accounted for by their physical conditions; indeed it seems that islands are peculiarly well fitted for these animals; for frogs have been introduced into madeira, the azores, and mauritius, and have multiplied so as to become a nuisance. but as these animals and their spawn are known to be immediately killed by sea-water, on my view we can see that there would be great difficulty in their transportal across the sea, and therefore why they do not exist on any oceanic island. but why, on the theory of creation, they should not have been created there, it would be very difficult to explain. mammals offer another and similar case. i have carefully searched the oldest voyages, but have not finished my search; as yet i have not found a single instance, free from doubt, of a terrestrial mammal (excluding domesticated animals kept by the natives) inhabiting an island situated above 300 miles from a continent or great continental island; and many islands situated at a much less distance are equally barren. the falkland islands, which are inhabited by a wolf-like fox, come nearest to an exception; but this group cannot be considered as oceanic, as it lies on a bank connected with the mainland; moreover, icebergs formerly brought boulders to its western shores, and they may have formerly transported foxes, as so frequently now happens in the arctic regions. yet it cannot be said that small islands will not support small mammals, for they occur in many parts of the world on very small islands, if close to a continent; and hardly an island can be named on which our smaller quadrupeds have not become naturalised and greatly multiplied. it cannot be said, on the ordinary view of creation, that there has not been time for the creation of mammals; many volcanic islands are sufficiently ancient, as shown by the stupendous degradation which they have suffered and by their tertiary strata: there has also been time for the production of endemic species belonging to other classes; and on continents it is thought that mammals appear and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower animals. though terrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands, aerial mammals do occur on almost every island. new zealand possesses two bats found nowhere else in the world: norfolk island, the viti archipelago, the bonin islands, the caroline and marianne archipelagoes, and mauritius, all possess their peculiar bats. why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands? on my view this question can easily be answered; for no terrestrial mammal can be transported across a wide space of sea, but bats can fly across. bats have been seen wandering by day far over the atlantic ocean; and two north american species either regularly or occasionally visit bermuda, at the distance of 600 miles from the mainland. i hear from mr. tomes, who has specially studied this family, that many of the same species have enormous ranges, and are found on continents and on far distant islands. hence we have only to suppose that such wandering species have been modified through natural selection in their new homes in relation to their new position, and we can understand the presence of endemic bats on islands, with the absence of all terrestrial mammals. besides the absence of terrestrial mammals in relation to the remoteness of islands from continents, there is also a relation, to a certain extent independent of distance, between the depth of the sea separating an island from the neighbouring mainland, and the presence in both of the same mammiferous species or of allied species in a more or less modified condition. mr. windsor earl has made some striking observations on this head in regard to the great malay archipelago, which is traversed near celebes by a space of deep ocean; and this space separates two widely distinct mammalian faunas. on either side the islands are situated on moderately deep submarine banks, and they are inhabited by closely allied or identical quadrupeds. no doubt some few anomalies occur in this great archipelago, and there is much difficulty in forming a judgment in some cases owing to the probable naturalisation of certain mammals through man's agency; but we shall soon have much light thrown on the natural history of this archipelago by the admirable zeal and researches of mr. wallace. i have not as yet had time to follow up this subject in all other quarters of the world; but as far as i have gone, the relation generally holds good. we see britain separated by a shallow channel from europe, and the mammals are the same on both sides; we meet with analogous facts on many islands separated by similar channels from australia. the west indian islands stand on a deeply submerged bank, nearly 1000 fathoms in depth, and here we find american forms, but the species and even the genera are distinct. as the amount of modification in all cases depends to a certain degree on the lapse of time, and as during changes of level it is obvious that islands separated by shallow channels are more likely to have been continuously united within a recent period to the mainland than islands separated by deeper channels, we can understand the frequent relation between the depth of the sea and the degree of affinity of the mammalian inhabitants of islands with those of a neighbouring continent,--an inexplicable relation on the view of independent acts of creation. all the foregoing remarks on the inhabitants of oceanic islands,--namely, the scarcity of kinds--the richness in endemic forms in particular classes or sections of classes,--the absence of whole groups, as of batrachians, and of terrestrial mammals notwithstanding the presence of aerial bats,--the singular proportions of certain orders of plants,--herbaceous forms having been developed into trees, etc.,--seem to me to accord better with the view of occasional means of transport having been largely efficient in the long course of time, than with the view of all our oceanic islands having been formerly connected by continuous land with the nearest continent; for on this latter view the migration would probably have been more complete; and if modification be admitted, all the forms of life would have been more equally modified, in accordance with the paramount importance of the relation of organism to organism. i do not deny that there are many and grave difficulties in understanding how several of the inhabitants of the more remote islands, whether still retaining the same specific form or modified since their arrival, could have reached their present homes. but the probability of many islands having existed as halting-places, of which not a wreck now remains, must not be overlooked. i will here give a single instance of one of the cases of difficulty. almost all oceanic islands, even the most isolated and smallest, are inhabited by land-shells, generally by endemic species, but sometimes by species found elsewhere. dr. aug. a. gould has given several interesting cases in regard to the land-shells of the islands of the pacific. now it is notorious that land-shells are very easily killed by salt; their eggs, at least such as i have tried, sink in sea-water and are killed by it. yet there must be, on my view, some unknown, but highly efficient means for their transportal. would the just-hatched young occasionally crawl on and adhere to the feet of birds roosting on the ground, and thus get transported? it occurred to me that land-shells, when hybernating and having a membranous diaphragm over the mouth of the shell, might be floated in chinks of drifted timber across moderately wide arms of the sea. and i found that several species did in this state withstand uninjured an immersion in sea-water during seven days: one of these shells was the helix pomatia, and after it had again hybernated i put it in sea-water for twenty days, and it perfectly recovered. as this species has a thick calcareous operculum, i removed it, and when it had formed a new membranous one, i immersed it for fourteen days in sea-water, and it recovered and crawled away: but more experiments are wanted on this head. the most striking and important fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of islands, is their affinity to those of the nearest mainland, without being actually the same species. numerous instances could be given of this fact. i will give only one, that of the galapagos archipelago, situated under the equator, between 500 and 600 miles from the shores of south america. here almost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakeable stamp of the american continent. there are twenty-six land birds, and twenty-five of these are ranked by mr. gould as distinct species, supposed to have been created here; yet the close affinity of most of these birds to american species in every character, in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice, was manifest. so it is with the other animals, and with nearly all the plants, as shown by dr. hooker in his admirable memoir on the flora of this archipelago. the naturalist, looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the pacific, distant several hundred miles from the continent, yet feels that he is standing on american land. why should this be so? why should the species which are supposed to have been created in the galapagos archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those created in america? there is nothing in the conditions of life, in the geological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in the proportions in which the several classes are associated together, which resembles closely the conditions of the south american coast: in fact there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects. on the other hand, there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature of the soil, in climate, height, and size of the islands, between the galapagos and cape de verde archipelagos: but what an entire and absolute difference in their inhabitants! the inhabitants of the cape de verde islands are related to those of africa, like those of the galapagos to america. i believe this grand fact can receive no sort of explanation on the ordinary view of independent creation; whereas on the view here maintained, it is obvious that the galapagos islands would be likely to receive colonists, whether by occasional means of transport or by formerly continuous land, from america; and the cape de verde islands from africa; and that such colonists would be liable to modification;--the principle of inheritance still betraying their original birthplace. many analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost universal rule that the endemic productions of islands are related to those of the nearest continent, or of other near islands. the exceptions are few, and most of them can be explained. thus the plants of kerguelen land, though standing nearer to africa than to america, are related, and that very closely, as we know from dr. hooker's account, to those of america: but on the view that this island has been mainly stocked by seeds brought with earth and stones on icebergs, drifted by the prevailing currents, this anomaly disappears. new zealand in its endemic plants is much more closely related to australia, the nearest mainland, than to any other region: and this is what might have been expected; but it is also plainly related to south america, which, although the next nearest continent, is so enormously remote, that the fact becomes an anomaly. but this difficulty almost disappears on the view that both new zealand, south america, and other southern lands were long ago partially stocked from a nearly intermediate though distant point, namely from the antarctic islands, when they were clothed with vegetation, before the commencement of the glacial period. the affinity, which, though feeble, i am assured by dr. hooker is real, between the flora of the south-western corner of australia and of the cape of good hope, is a far more remarkable case, and is at present inexplicable: but this affinity is confined to the plants, and will, i do not doubt, be some day explained. the law which causes the inhabitants of an archipelago, though specifically distinct, to be closely allied to those of the nearest continent, we sometimes see displayed on a small scale, yet in a most interesting manner, within the limits of the same archipelago. thus the several islands of the galapagos archipelago are tenanted, as i have elsewhere shown, in a quite marvellous manner, by very closely related species; so that the inhabitants of each separate island, though mostly distinct, are related in an incomparably closer degree to each other than to the inhabitants of any other part of the world. and this is just what might have been expected on my view, for the islands are situated so near each other that they would almost certainly receive immigrants from the same original source, or from each other. but this dissimilarity between the endemic inhabitants of the islands may be used as an argument against my views; for it may be asked, how has it happened in the several islands situated within sight of each other, having the same geological nature, the same height, climate, etc., that many of the immigrants should have been differently modified, though only in a small degree. this long appeared to me a great difficulty: but it arises in chief part from the deeply-seated error of considering the physical conditions of a country as the most important for its inhabitants; whereas it cannot, i think, be disputed that the nature of the other inhabitants, with which each has to compete, is at least as important, and generally a far more important element of success. now if we look to those inhabitants of the galapagos archipelago which are found in other parts of the world (laying on one side for the moment the endemic species, which cannot be here fairly included, as we are considering how they have come to be modified since their arrival), we find a considerable amount of difference in the several islands. this difference might indeed have been expected on the view of the islands having been stocked by occasional means of transport--a seed, for instance, of one plant having been brought to one island, and that of another plant to another island. hence when in former times an immigrant settled on any one or more of the islands, or when it subsequently spread from one island to another, it would undoubtedly be exposed to different conditions of life in the different islands, for it would have to compete with different sets of organisms: a plant, for instance, would find the best-fitted ground more perfectly occupied by distinct plants in one island than in another, and it would be exposed to the attacks of somewhat different enemies. if then it varied, natural selection would probably favour different varieties in the different islands. some species, however, might spread and yet retain the same character throughout the group, just as we see on continents some species spreading widely and remaining the same. the really surprising fact in this case of the galapagos archipelago, and in a lesser degree in some analogous instances, is that the new species formed in the separate islands have not quickly spread to the other islands. but the islands, though in sight of each other, are separated by deep arms of the sea, in most cases wider than the british channel, and there is no reason to suppose that they have at any former period been continuously united. the currents of the sea are rapid and sweep across the archipelago, and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare; so that the islands are far more effectually separated from each other than they appear to be on a map. nevertheless a good many species, both those found in other parts of the world and those confined to the archipelago, are common to the several islands, and we may infer from certain facts that these have probably spread from some one island to the others. but we often take, i think, an erroneous view of the probability of closely allied species invading each other's territory, when put into free intercommunication. undoubtedly if one species has any advantage whatever over another, it will in a very brief time wholly or in part supplant it; but if both are equally well fitted for their own places in nature, both probably will hold their own places and keep separate for almost any length of time. being familiar with the fact that many species, naturalised through man's agency, have spread with astonishing rapidity over new countries, we are apt to infer that most species would thus spread; but we should remember that the forms which become naturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied to the aboriginal inhabitants, but are very distinct species, belonging in a large proportion of cases, as shown by alph. de candolle, to distinct genera. in the galapagos archipelago, many even of the birds, though so well adapted for flying from island to island, are distinct on each; thus there are three closely-allied species of mocking-thrush, each confined to its own island. now let us suppose the mocking-thrush of chatham island to be blown to charles island, which has its own mocking-thrush: why should it succeed in establishing itself there? we may safely infer that charles island is well stocked with its own species, for annually more eggs are laid there than can possibly be reared; and we may infer that the mocking-thrush peculiar to charles island is at least as well fitted for its home as is the species peculiar to chatham island. sir c. lyell and mr. wollaston have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this subject; namely, that madeira and the adjoining islet of porto santo possess many distinct but representative land-shells, some of which live in crevices of stone; and although large quantities of stone are annually transported from porto santo to madeira, yet this latter island has not become colonised by the porto santo species: nevertheless both islands have been colonised by some european land-shells, which no doubt had some advantage over the indigenous species. from these considerations i think we need not greatly marvel at the endemic and representative species, which inhabit the several islands of the galapagos archipelago, not having universally spread from island to island. in many other instances, as in the several districts of the same continent, pre-occupation has probably played an important part in checking the commingling of species under the same conditions of life. thus, the south-east and south-west corners of australia have nearly the same physical conditions, and are united by continuous land, yet they are inhabited by a vast number of distinct mammals, birds, and plants. the principle which determines the general character of the fauna and flora of oceanic islands, namely, that the inhabitants, when not identically the same, yet are plainly related to the inhabitants of that region whence colonists could most readily have been derived,--the colonists having been subsequently modified and better fitted to their new homes,--is of the widest application throughout nature. we see this on every mountain, in every lake and marsh. for alpine species, excepting in so far as the same forms, chiefly of plants, have spread widely throughout the world during the recent glacial epoch, are related to those of the surrounding lowlands;--thus we have in south america, alpine humming-birds, alpine rodents, alpine plants, etc., all of strictly american forms, and it is obvious that a mountain, as it became slowly upheaved, would naturally be colonised from the surrounding lowlands. so it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes, excepting in so far as great facility of transport has given the same general forms to the whole world. we see this same principle in the blind animals inhabiting the caves of america and of europe. other analogous facts could be given. and it will, i believe, be universally found to be true, that wherever in two regions, let them be ever so distant, many closely allied or representative species occur, there will likewise be found some identical species, showing, in accordance with the foregoing view, that at some former period there has been intercommunication or migration between the two regions. and wherever many closely-allied species occur, there will be found many forms which some naturalists rank as distinct species, and some as varieties; these doubtful forms showing us the steps in the process of modification. this relation between the power and extent of migration of a species, either at the present time or at some former period under different physical conditions, and the existence at remote points of the world of other species allied to it, is shown in another and more general way. mr. gould remarked to me long ago, that in those genera of birds which range over the world, many of the species have very wide ranges. i can hardly doubt that this rule is generally true, though it would be difficult to prove it. amongst mammals, we see it strikingly displayed in bats, and in a lesser degree in the felidae and canidae. we see it, if we compare the distribution of butterflies and beetles. so it is with most fresh-water productions, in which so many genera range over the world, and many individual species have enormous ranges. it is not meant that in world-ranging genera all the species have a wide range, or even that they have on an average a wide range; but only that some of the species range very widely; for the facility with which widely-ranging species vary and give rise to new forms will largely determine their average range. for instance, two varieties of the same species inhabit america and europe, and the species thus has an immense range; but, if the variation had been a little greater, the two varieties would have been ranked as distinct species, and the common range would have been greatly reduced. still less is it meant, that a species which apparently has the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging widely, as in the case of certain powerfully-winged birds, will necessarily range widely; for we should never forget that to range widely implies not only the power of crossing barriers, but the more important power of being victorious in distant lands in the struggle for life with foreign associates. but on the view of all the species of a genus having descended from a single parent, though now distributed to the most remote points of the world, we ought to find, and i believe as a general rule we do find, that some at least of the species range very widely; for it is necessary that the unmodified parent should range widely, undergoing modification during its diffusion, and should place itself under diverse conditions favourable for the conversion of its offspring, firstly into new varieties and ultimately into new species. in considering the wide distribution of certain genera, we should bear in mind that some are extremely ancient, and must have branched off from a common parent at a remote epoch; so that in such cases there will have been ample time for great climatal and geographical changes and for accidents of transport; and consequently for the migration of some of the species into all quarters of the world, where they may have become slightly modified in relation to their new conditions. there is, also, some reason to believe from geological evidence that organisms low in the scale within each great class, generally change at a slower rate than the higher forms; and consequently the lower forms will have had a better chance of ranging widely and of still retaining the same specific character. this fact, together with the seeds and eggs of many low forms being very minute and better fitted for distant transportation, probably accounts for a law which has long been observed, and which has lately been admirably discussed by alph. de candolle in regard to plants, namely, that the lower any group of organisms is, the more widely it is apt to range. the relations just discussed,--namely, low and slowly-changing organisms ranging more widely than the high,--some of the species of widely-ranging genera themselves ranging widely,--such facts, as alpine, lacustrine, and marsh productions being related (with the exceptions before specified) to those on the surrounding low lands and dry lands, though these stations are so different--the very close relation of the distinct species which inhabit the islets of the same archipelago,--and especially the striking relation of the inhabitants of each whole archipelago or island to those of the nearest mainland,--are, i think, utterly inexplicable on the ordinary view of the independent creation of each species, but are explicable on the view of colonisation from the nearest and readiest source, together with the subsequent modification and better adaptation of the colonists to their new homes. summary of last and present chapters. in these chapters i have endeavoured to show, that if we make due allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of all the changes of climate and of the level of the land, which have certainly occurred within the recent period, and of other similar changes which may have occurred within the same period; if we remember how profoundly ignorant we are with respect to the many and curious means of occasional transport,--a subject which has hardly ever been properly experimentised on; if we bear in mind how often a species may have ranged continuously over a wide area, and then have become extinct in the intermediate tracts, i think the difficulties in believing that all the individuals of the same species, wherever located, have descended from the same parents, are not insuperable. and we are led to this conclusion, which has been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of single centres of creation, by some general considerations, more especially from the importance of barriers and from the analogical distribution of sub-genera, genera, and families. with respect to the distinct species of the same genus, which on my theory must have spread from one parent-source; if we make the same allowances as before for our ignorance, and remember that some forms of life change most slowly, enormous periods of time being thus granted for their migration, i do not think that the difficulties are insuperable; though they often are in this case, and in that of the individuals of the same species, extremely grave. as exemplifying the effects of climatal changes on distribution, i have attempted to show how important has been the influence of the modern glacial period, which i am fully convinced simultaneously affected the whole world, or at least great meridional belts. as showing how diversified are the means of occasional transport, i have discussed at some little length the means of dispersal of fresh-water productions. if the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long course of time the individuals of the same species, and likewise of allied species, have proceeded from some one source; then i think all the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of migration (generally of the more dominant forms of life), together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. we can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces. we can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; and how it is that under different latitudes, for instance in south america, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent. bearing in mind that the mutual relations of organism to organism are of the highest importance, we can see why two areas having nearly the same physical conditions should often be inhabited by very different forms of life; for according to the length of time which has elapsed since new inhabitants entered one region; according to the nature of the communication which allowed certain forms and not others to enter, either in greater or lesser numbers; according or not, as those which entered happened to come in more or less direct competition with each other and with the aborigines; and according as the immigrants were capable of varying more or less rapidly, there would ensue in different regions, independently of their physical conditions, infinitely diversified conditions of life,--there would be an almost endless amount of organic action and reaction,--and we should find, as we do find, some groups of beings greatly, and some only slightly modified,--some developed in great force, some existing in scanty numbers--in the different great geographical provinces of the world. on these same principles, we can understand, as i have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar; and why, in relation to the means of migration, one group of beings, even within the same class, should have all its species endemic, and another group should have all its species common to other quarters of the world. we can see why whole groups of organisms, as batrachians and terrestrial mammals, should be absent from oceanic islands, whilst the most isolated islands possess their own peculiar species of aerial mammals or bats. we can see why there should be some relation between the presence of mammals, in a more or less modified condition, and the depth of the sea between an island and the mainland. we can clearly see why all the inhabitants of an archipelago, though specifically distinct on the several islets, should be closely related to each other, and likewise be related, but less closely, to those of the nearest continent or other source whence immigrants were probably derived. we can see why in two areas, however distant from each other, there should be a correlation, in the presence of identical species, of varieties, of doubtful species, and of distinct but representative species. as the late edward forbes often insisted, there is a striking parallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space: the laws governing the succession of forms in past times being nearly the same with those governing at the present time the differences in different areas. we see this in many facts. the endurance of each species and group of species is continuous in time; for the exceptions to the rule are so few, that they may fairly be attributed to our not having as yet discovered in an intermediate deposit the forms which are therein absent, but which occur above and below: so in space, it certainly is the general rule that the area inhabited by a single species, or by a group of species, is continuous; and the exceptions, which are not rare, may, as i have attempted to show, be accounted for by migration at some former period under different conditions or by occasional means of transport, and by the species having become extinct in the intermediate tracts. both in time and space, species and groups of species have their points of maximum development. groups of species, belonging either to a certain period of time, or to a certain area, are often characterised by trifling characters in common, as of sculpture or colour. in looking to the long succession of ages, as in now looking to distant provinces throughout the world, we find that some organisms differ little, whilst others belonging to a different class, or to a different order, or even only to a different family of the same order, differ greatly. in both time and space the lower members of each class generally change less than the higher; but there are in both cases marked exceptions to the rule. on my theory these several relations throughout time and space are intelligible; for whether we look to the forms of life which have changed during successive ages within the same quarter of the world, or to those which have changed after having migrated into distant quarters, in both cases the forms within each class have been connected by the same bond of ordinary generation; and the more nearly any two forms are related in blood, the nearer they will generally stand to each other in time and space; in both cases the laws of variation have been the same, and modifications have been accumulated by the same power of natural selection. 13. mutual affinities of organic beings: morphology: embryology: rudimentary organs. classification, groups subordinate to groups. natural system. rules and difficulties in

other in descending degrees, so that they can be classed in groups under groups. this classification is evidently not arbitrary like the grouping of the stars in constellations. the existence of groups would have been of simple signification, if one group had been exclusively fitted to inhabit the land, and another the water; one to feed on flesh, another on vegetable matter, and so on; but the case is widely different in nature; for it is notorious how commonly members of even the same subgroup have different habits. in our second and fourth chapters, on variation and on natural selection, i have attempted to show that it is the widely ranging, the much diffused and common, that is the dominant species belonging to the larger genera, which vary most. the varieties, or incipient species, thus produced ultimately become converted, as i believe, into new and distinct species; and these, on the principle of inheritance, tend to produce other new and dominant species. consequently the groups which are now large, and which generally include many dominant species, tend to go on increasing indefinitely in size. i further attempted to show that from the varying descendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as different places as possible in the economy of nature, there is a constant tendency in their characters to diverge. this conclusion was supported by looking at the great diversity of the forms of life which, in any small area, come into the closest competition, and by looking to certain facts in naturalisation. i attempted also to show that there is a constant tendency in the forms which are increasing in number and diverging in character, to supplant and exterminate the less divergent, the less improved, and preceding forms. i request the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the action, as formerly explained, of these several principles; and he will see that the inevitable result is that the modified descendants proceeding from one progenitor become broken up into groups subordinate to groups. in the diagram each letter on the uppermost line may represent a genus including several species; and all the genera on this line form together one class, for all have descended from one ancient but unseen parent, and, consequently, have inherited something in common. but the three genera on the left hand have, on this same principle, much in common, and form a sub-family, distinct from that including the next two genera on the right hand, which diverged from a common parent at the fifth stage of descent. these five genera have also much, though less, in common; and they form a family distinct from that including the three genera still further to the right hand, which diverged at a still earlier period. and all these genera, descended from (a), form an order distinct from the genera descended from (i). so that we here have many species descended from a single progenitor grouped into genera; and the genera are included in, or subordinate to, sub-families, families, and orders, all united into one class. thus, the grand fact in natural history of the subordination of group under group, which, from its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in my judgment fully explained. naturalists try to arrange the species, genera, and families in each class, on what is called the natural system. but what is meant by this system? some authors look at it merely as a scheme for arranging together those living objects which are most alike, and for separating those which are most unlike; or as an artificial means for enunciating, as briefly as possible, general propositions,--that is, by one sentence to give the characters common, for instance, to all mammals, by another those common to all carnivora, by another those common to the dog-genus, and then by adding a single sentence, a full description is given of each kind of dog. the ingenuity and utility of this system are indisputable. but many naturalists think that something more is meant by the natural system; they believe that it reveals the plan of the creator; but unless it be specified whether order in time or space, or what else is meant by the plan of the creator, it seems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge. such expressions as that famous one of linnaeus, and which we often meet with in a more or less concealed form, that the characters do not make the genus, but that the genus gives the characters, seem to imply that something more is included in our classification, than mere resemblance. i believe that something more is included; and that propinquity of descent,--the only known cause of the similarity of organic beings,--is the bond, hidden as it is by various degrees of modification, which is partially revealed to us by our classifications. let us now consider the rules followed in classification, and the difficulties which are encountered on the view that classification either gives some unknown plan of creation, or is simply a scheme for enunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms most like each other. it might have been thought (and was in ancient times thought) that those parts of the structure which determined the habits of life, and the general place of each being in the economy of nature, would be of very high importance in classification. nothing can be more false. no one regards the external similarity of a mouse to a shrew, of a dugong to a whale, of a whale to a fish, as of any importance. these resemblances, though so intimately connected with the whole life of the being, are ranked as merely "adaptive or analogical characters;" but to the consideration of these resemblances we shall have to recur. it may even be given as a general rule, that the less any part of the organisation is concerned with special habits, the more important it becomes for classification. as an instance: owen, in speaking of the dugong, says, "the generative organs being those which are most remotely related to the habits and food of an animal, i have always regarded as affording very clear indications of its true affinities. we are least likely in the modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptive for an essential character." so with plants, how remarkable it is that the organs of vegetation, on which their whole life depends, are of little signification, excepting in the first main divisions; whereas the organs of reproduction, with their product the seed, are of paramount importance! we must not, therefore, in classifying, trust to resemblances in parts of the organisation, however important they may be for the welfare of the being in relation to the outer world. perhaps from this cause it has partly arisen, that almost all naturalists lay the greatest stress on resemblances in organs of high vital or physiological importance. no doubt this view of the classificatory importance of organs which are important is generally, but by no means always, true. but their importance for classification, i believe, depends on their greater constancy throughout large groups of species; and this constancy depends on such organs having generally been subjected to less change in the adaptation of the species to their conditions of life. that the mere physiological importance of an organ does not determine its classificatory value, is almost shown by the one fact, that in allied groups, in which the same organ, as we have every reason to suppose, has nearly the same physiological value, its classificatory value is widely different. no naturalist can have worked at any group without being struck with this fact; and it has been most fully acknowledged in the writings of almost every author. it will suffice to quote the highest authority, robert brown, who in speaking of certain organs in the proteaceae, says their generic importance, "like that of all their parts, not only in this but, as i apprehend, in every natural family, is very unequal, and in some cases seems to be entirely lost." again in another work he says, the genera of the connaraceae "differ in having one or more ovaria, in the existence or absence of albumen, in the imbricate or valvular aestivation. any one of these characters singly is frequently of more than generic importance, though here even when all taken together they appear insufficient to separate cnestis from connarus." to give an example amongst insects, in one great division of the hymenoptera, the antennae, as westwood has remarked, are most constant in structure; in another division they differ much, and the differences are of quite subordinate value in classification; yet no one probably will say that the antennae in these two divisions of the same order are of unequal physiological importance. any number of instances could be given of the varying importance for classification of the same important organ within the same group of beings. again, no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of high physiological or vital importance; yet, undoubtedly, organs in this condition are often of high value in classification. no one will dispute that the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants, and certain rudimentary bones of the leg, are highly serviceable in exhibiting the close affinity between ruminants and pachyderms. robert brown has strongly insisted on the fact that the rudimentary florets are of the highest importance in the classification of the grasses. numerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts which must be considered of very trifling physiological importance, but which are universally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition of whole groups. for instance, whether or not there is an open passage from the nostrils to the mouth, the only character, according to owen, which absolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles--the inflection of the angle of the jaws in marsupials--the manner in which the wings of insects are folded--mere colour in certain algae--mere pubescence on parts of the flower in grasses--the nature of the dermal covering, as hair or feathers, in the vertebrata. if the ornithorhynchus had been covered with feathers instead of hair, this external and trifling character would, i think, have been considered by naturalists as important an aid in determining the degree of affinity of this strange creature to birds and reptiles, as an approach in structure in any one internal and important organ. the importance, for classification, of trifling characters, mainly depends on their being correlated with several other characters of more or less importance. the value indeed of an aggregate of characters is very evident in natural history. hence, as has often been remarked, a species may depart from its allies in several characters, both of high physiological importance and of almost universal prevalence, and yet leave us in no doubt where it should be ranked. hence, also, it has been found, that a classification founded on any single character, however important that may be, has always failed; for no part of the organisation is universally constant. the importance of an aggregate of characters, even when none are important, alone explains, i think, that saying of linnaeus, that the characters do not give the genus, but the genus gives the characters; for this saying seems founded on an appreciation of many trifling points of resemblance, too slight to be defined. certain plants, belonging to the malpighiaceae, bear perfect and degraded flowers; in the latter, as a. de jussieu has remarked, "the greater number of the characters proper to the species, to the genus, to the family, to the class, disappear, and thus laugh at our classification." but when aspicarpa produced in france, during several years, only degraded flowers, departing so wonderfully in a number of the most important points of structure from the proper type of the order, yet m. richard sagaciously saw, as jussieu observes, that this genus should still be retained amongst the malpighiaceae. this case seems to me well to illustrate the spirit with which our classifications are sometimes necessarily founded. practically when naturalists are at work, they do not trouble themselves about the physiological value of the characters which they use in defining a group, or in allocating any particular species. if they find a character nearly uniform, and common to a great number of forms, and not common to others, they use it as one of high value; if common to some lesser number, they use it as of subordinate value. this principle has been broadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one; and by none more clearly than by that excellent botanist, aug. st. hilaire. if certain characters are always found correlated with others, though no apparent bond of connexion can be discovered between them, especial value is set on them. as in most groups of animals, important organs, such as those for propelling the blood, or for aerating it, or those for propagating the race, are found nearly uniform, they are considered as highly serviceable in classification; but in some groups of animals all these, the most important vital organs, are found to offer characters of quite subordinate value. we can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equal importance with those derived from the adult, for our classifications of course include all ages of each species. but it is by no means obvious, on the ordinary view, why the structure of the embryo should be more important for this purpose than that of the adult, which alone plays its full part in the economy of nature. yet it has been strongly urged by those great naturalists, milne edwards and agassiz, that embryonic characters are the most important of any in the classification of animals; and this doctrine has very generally been admitted as true. the same fact holds good with flowering plants, of which the two main divisions have been founded on characters derived from the embryo,--on the number and position of the embryonic leaves or cotyledons, and on the mode of development of the plumule and radicle. in our discussion on embryology, we shall see why such characters are so valuable, on the view of classification tacitly including the idea of descent. our classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of affinities. nothing can be easier than to define a number of characters common to all birds; but in the case of crustaceans, such definition has hitherto been found impossible. there are crustaceans at the opposite ends of the series, which have hardly a character in common; yet the species at both ends, from being plainly allied to others, and these to others, and so onwards, can be recognised as unequivocally belonging to this, and to no other class of the articulata. geographical distribution has often been used, though perhaps not quite logically, in classification, more especially in very large groups of closely allied forms. temminck insists on the utility or even necessity of this practice in certain groups of birds; and it has been followed by several entomologists and botanists. finally, with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of species, such as orders, sub-orders, families, sub-families, and genera, they seem to be, at least at present, almost arbitrary. several of the best botanists, such as mr. bentham and others, have strongly insisted on their arbitrary value. instances could be given amongst plants and insects, of a group of forms, first ranked by practised naturalists as only a genus, and then raised to the rank of a sub-family or family; and this has been done, not because further research has detected important structural differences, at first overlooked, but because numerous allied species, with slightly different grades of difference, have been subsequently discovered. all the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if i do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together and separating objects more or less alike. but i must explain my meaning more fully. i believe that the arrangement of the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to the other groups, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but that the amount of difference in the several branches or groups, though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which they have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera, families, sections, or orders. the reader will best understand what is meant, if he will take the trouble of referring to the diagram in the fourth chapter. we will suppose the letters a to l to represent allied genera, which lived during the silurian epoch, and these have descended from a species which existed at an unknown anterior period. species of three of these genera (a, f, and i) have transmitted modified descendants to the present day, represented by the fifteen genera (a14 to z14) on the uppermost horizontal line. now all these modified descendants from a single species, are represented as related in blood or descent to the same degree; they may metaphorically be called cousins to the same millionth degree; yet they differ widely and in different degrees from each other. the forms descended from a, now broken up into two or three families, constitute a distinct order from those descended from i, also broken up into two families. nor can the existing species, descended from a, be ranked in the same genus with the parent a; or those from i, with the parent i. but the existing genus f14 may be supposed to have been but slightly modified; and it will then rank with the parent-genus f; just as some few still living organic beings belong to silurian genera. so that the amount or value of the differences between organic beings all related to each other in the same degree in blood, has come to be widely different. nevertheless their genealogical arrangement remains strictly true, not only at the present time, but at each successive period of descent. all the modified descendants from a will have inherited something in common from their common parent, as will all the descendants from i; so will it be with each subordinate branch of descendants, at each successive period. if, however, we choose to suppose that any of the descendants of a or of i have been so much modified as to have more or less completely lost traces of their parentage, in this case, their places in a natural classification will have been more or less completely lost,--as sometimes seems to have occurred with existing organisms. all the descendants of the genus f, along its whole line of descent, are supposed to have been but little modified, and they yet form a single genus. but this genus, though much isolated, will still occupy its proper intermediate position; for f originally was intermediate in character between a and i, and the several genera descended from these two genera will have inherited to a certain extent their characters. this natural arrangement is shown, as far as is possible on paper, in the diagram, but in much too simple a manner. if a branching diagram had not been used, and only the names of the groups had been written in a linear series, it would have been still less possible to have given a natural arrangement; and it is notoriously not possible to represent in a series, on a flat surface, the affinities which we discover in nature amongst the beings of the same group. thus, on the view which i hold, the natural system is genealogical in its arrangement, like a pedigree; but the degrees of modification which the different groups have undergone, have to be expressed by ranking them under different so-called genera, sub-families, families, sections, orders, and classes. it may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by taking the case of languages. if we possessed a perfect pedigree of mankind, a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the best classification of the various languages now spoken throughout the world; and if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and slowly changing dialects, had to be included, such an arrangement would, i think, be the only possible one. yet it might be that some very ancient language had altered little, and had given rise to few new languages, whilst others (owing to the spreading and subsequent isolation and states of civilisation of the several races, descended from a common race) had altered much, and had given rise to many new languages and dialects. the various degrees of difference in the languages from the same stock, would have to be expressed by groups subordinate to groups; but the proper or even only possible arrangement would still be genealogical; and this would be strictly natural, as it would connect together all languages, extinct and modern, by the closest affinities, and would give the filiation and origin of each tongue. in confirmation of this view, let us glance at the classification of varieties, which are believed or known to have descended from one species. these are grouped under species, with sub-varieties under varieties; and with our domestic productions, several other grades of difference are requisite, as we have seen with pigeons. the origin of the existence of groups subordinate to groups, is the same with varieties as with species, namely, closeness of descent with various degrees of modification. nearly the same rules are followed in classifying varieties, as with species. authors have insisted on the necessity of classing varieties on a natural instead of an artificial system; we are cautioned, for instance, not to class two varieties of the pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most important part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts the swedish and common turnips together, though the esculent and thickened stems are so similar. whatever part is found to be most constant, is used in classing varieties: thus the great agriculturist marshall says the horns are very useful for this purpose with cattle, because they are less variable than the shape or colour of the body, etc.; whereas with sheep the horns are much less serviceable, because less constant. in classing varieties, i apprehend if we had a real pedigree, a genealogical classification would be universally preferred; and it has been attempted by some authors. for we might feel sure, whether there had been more or less modification, the principle of inheritance would keep the forms together which were allied in the greatest number of points. in tumbler pigeons, though some sub-varieties differ from the others in the important character of having a longer beak, yet all are kept together from having the common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has nearly or quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any reasoning or thinking on the subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group, because allied in blood and alike in some other respects. if it could be proved that the hottentot had descended from the negro, i think he would be classed under the negro group, however much he might differ in colour and other important characters from negroes. with species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact brought descent into his classification; for he includes in his lowest grade, or that of a species, the two sexes; and how enormously these sometimes differ in the most important characters, is known to every naturalist: scarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the males and hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes, when adult, and yet no one dreams of separating them. the naturalist includes as one species the several larval stages of the same individual, however much they may differ from each other and from the adult; as he likewise includes the so-called alternate generations of steenstrup, which can only in a technical sense be considered as the same individual. he includes monsters; he includes varieties, not solely because they closely resemble the parent-form, but because they are descended from it. he who believes that the cowslip is descended from the primrose, or conversely, ranks them together as a single species, and gives a single definition. as soon as three orchidean forms (monochanthus, myanthus, and catasetum), which had previously been ranked as three distinct genera, were known to be sometimes produced on the same spike, they were immediately included as a single species. but it may be asked, what ought we to do, if it could be proved that one species of kangaroo had been produced, by a long course of modification, from a bear? ought we to rank this one species with bears, and what should we do with the other species? the supposition is of course preposterous; and i might answer by the argumentum ad hominem, and ask what should be done if a perfect kangaroo were seen to come out of the womb of a bear? according to all analogy, it would be ranked with bears; but then assuredly all the other species of the kangaroo family would have to be classed under the bear genus. the whole case is preposterous; for where there has been close descent in common, there will certainly be close resemblance or affinity. as descent has universally been used in classing together the individuals of the same species, though the males and females and larvae are sometimes extremely different; and as it has been used in classing varieties which have undergone a certain, and sometimes a considerable amount of modification, may not this same element of descent have been unconsciously used in grouping species under genera, and genera under higher groups, though in these cases the modification has been greater in degree, and has taken a longer time to complete? i believe it has thus been unconsciously used; and only thus can i understand the several rules and guides which have been followed by our best systematists. we have no written pedigrees; we have to make out community of descent by resemblances of any kind. therefore we choose those characters which, as far as we can judge, are the least likely to have been modified in relation to the conditions of life to which each species has been recently exposed. rudimentary structures on this view are as good as, or even sometimes better than, other parts of the organisation. we care not how trifling a character may be--let it be the mere inflection of the angle of the jaw, the manner in which an insect's wing is folded, whether the skin be covered by hair or feathers--if it prevail throughout many and different species, especially those having very different habits of life, it assumes high value; for we can account for its presence in so many forms with such different habits, only by its inheritance from a common parent. we may err in this respect in regard to single points of structure, but when several characters, let them be ever so trifling, occur together throughout a large group of beings having different habits, we may feel almost sure, on the theory of descent, that these characters have been inherited from a common ancestor. and we know that such correlated or aggregated characters have especial value in classification. we can understand why a species or a group of species may depart, in several of its most important characteristics, from its allies, and yet be safely classed with them. this may be safely done, and is often done, as long as a sufficient number of characters, let them be ever so unimportant, betrays the hidden bond of community of descent. let two forms have not a single character in common, yet if these extreme forms are connected together by a chain of intermediate groups, we may at once infer their community of descent, and we put them all into the same class. as we find organs of high physiological importance--those which serve to preserve life under the most diverse conditions of existence--are generally the most constant, we attach especial value to them; but if these same organs, in another group or section of a group, are found to differ much, we at once value them less in our classification. we shall hereafter, i think, clearly see why embryological characters are of such high classificatory importance. geographical distribution may sometimes be brought usefully into play in classing large and widely-distributed genera, because all the species of the same genus, inhabiting any distinct and isolated region, have in all probability descended from the same parents. we can understand, on these views, the very important distinction between real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances. lamarck first called attention to this distinction, and he has been ably followed by macleay and others. the resemblance, in the shape of the body and in the fin-like anterior limbs, between the dugong, which is a pachydermatous animal, and the whale, and between both these mammals and fishes, is analogical. amongst insects there are innumerable instances: thus linnaeus, misled by external appearances, actually classed an homopterous insect as a moth. we see something of the same kind even in our domestic varieties, as in the thickened stems of the common and swedish turnip. the resemblance of the greyhound and racehorse is hardly more fanciful than the analogies which have been drawn by some authors between very distinct animals. on my view of characters being of real importance for classification, only in so far as they reveal descent, we can clearly understand why analogical or adaptive character, although of the utmost importance to the welfare of the being, are almost valueless to the systematist. for animals, belonging to two most distinct lines of descent, may readily become adapted to similar conditions, and thus assume a close external resemblance; but such resemblances will not reveal--will rather tend to conceal their blood-relationship to their proper lines of descent. we can also understand the apparent paradox, that the very same characters are analogical when one class or order is compared with another, but give true affinities when the members of the same class or order are compared one with another: thus the shape of the body and fin-like limbs are only analogical when whales are compared with fishes, being adaptations in both classes for swimming through the water; but the shape of the body and fin-like limbs serve as characters exhibiting true affinity between the several members of the whale family; for these cetaceans agree in so many characters, great and small, that we cannot doubt that they have inherited their general shape of body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor. so it is with fishes. as members of distinct classes have often been adapted by successive slight modifications to live under nearly similar circumstances,--to inhabit for instance the three elements of land, air, and water,--we can perhaps understand how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometimes been observed between the sub-groups in distinct classes. a naturalist, struck by a parallelism of this nature in any one class, by arbitrarily raising or sinking the value of the groups in other classes (and all our experience shows that this valuation has hitherto been arbitrary), could easily extend the parallelism over a wide range; and thus the septenary, quinary, quaternary, and ternary classifications have probably arisen. as the modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the larger genera, tend to inherit the advantages, which made the groups to which they belong large and their parents dominant, they are almost sure to spread widely, and to seize on more and more places in the economy of nature. the larger and more dominant groups thus tend to go on increasing in size; and they consequently supplant many smaller and feebler groups. thus we can account for the fact that all organisms, recent and extinct, are included under a few great orders, under still fewer classes, and all in one great natural system. as showing how few the higher groups are in number, and how widely spread they are throughout the world, the fact is striking, that the discovery of australia has not added a single insect belonging to a new order; and that in the vegetable kingdom, as i learn from dr. hooker, it has added only two or three orders of small size. in the chapter on geological succession i attempted to show, on the principle of each group having generally diverged much in character during the long-continued process of modification, how it is that the more ancient forms of life often present characters in some slight degree intermediate between existing groups. a few old and intermediate parent-forms having occasionally transmitted to the present day descendants but little modified, will give to us our so-called osculant or aberrant groups. the more aberrant any form is, the greater must be the number of connecting forms which on my theory have been exterminated and utterly lost. and we have some evidence of aberrant forms having suffered severely from extinction, for they are generally represented by extremely few species; and such species as do occur are generally very distinct from each other, which again implies extinction. the genera ornithorhynchus and lepidosiren, for example, would not have been less aberrant had each been represented by a dozen species instead of by a single one; but such richness in species, as i find after some investigation, does not commonly fall to the lot of aberrant genera. we can, i think, account for this fact only by looking at aberrant forms as failing groups conquered by more successful competitors, with a few members preserved by some unusual coincidence of favourable circumstances. mr. waterhouse has remarked that, when a member belonging to one group of animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group, this affinity in most cases is general and not special: thus, according to mr. waterhouse, of all rodents, the bizcacha is most nearly related to marsupials; but in the points in which it approaches this order, its relations are general, and not to any one marsupial species more than to another. as the points of affinity of the bizcacha to marsupials are believed to be real and not merely adaptive, they are due on my theory to inheritance in common. therefore we must suppose either that all rodents, including the bizcacha, branched off from some very ancient marsupial, which will have had a character in some degree intermediate with respect to all existing marsupials; or that both rodents and marsupials branched off from a common progenitor, and that both groups have since undergone much modification in divergent directions. on either view we may suppose that the bizcacha has retained, by inheritance, more of the character of its ancient progenitor than have other rodents; and therefore it will not be specially related to any one existing marsupial, but indirectly to all or nearly all marsupials, from having partially retained the character of their common progenitor, or of an early member of the group. on the other hand, of all marsupials, as mr. waterhouse has remarked, the phascolomys resembles most nearly, not any one species, but the general order of rodents. in this case, however, it may be strongly suspected that the resemblance is only analogical, owing to the phascolomys having become adapted to habits like those of a rodent. the elder de candolle has made nearly similar observations on the general nature of the affinities of distinct orders of plants. on the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in character of the species descended from a common parent, together with their retention by inheritance of some characters in common, we can understand the excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all the members of the same family or higher group are connected together. for the common parent of a whole family of species, now broken up by extinction into distinct groups and sub-groups, will have transmitted some of its characters, modified in various ways and degrees, to all; and the several species will consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines of affinity of various lengths (as may be seen in the diagram so often referred to), mounting up through many predecessors. as it is difficult to show the blood-relationship between the numerous kindred of any ancient and noble family, even by the aid of a genealogical tree, and almost impossible to do this without this aid, we can understand the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in describing, without the aid of a diagram, the various affinities which they perceive between the many living and extinct members of the same great natural class. extinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an important part in defining and widening the intervals between the several groups in each class. we may thus account even for the distinctness of whole classes from each other--for instance, of birds from all other vertebrate animals--by the belief that many ancient forms of life have been utterly lost, through which the early progenitors of birds were formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other vertebrate classes. there has been less entire extinction of the forms of life which once connected fishes with batrachians. there has been still less in some other classes, as in that of the crustacea, for here the most wonderfully diverse forms are still tied together by a long, but broken, chain of affinities. extinction has only separated groups: it has by no means made them; for if every form which has ever lived on this earth were suddenly to reappear, though it would be quite impossible to give definitions by which each group could be distinguished from other groups, as all would blend together by steps as fine as those between the finest existing varieties, nevertheless a natural classification, or at least a natural arrangement, would be possible. we shall see this by turning to the diagram: the letters, a to l, may represent eleven silurian genera, some of which have produced large groups of modified descendants. every intermediate link between these eleven genera and their primordial parent, and every intermediate link in each branch and sub-branch of their descendants, may be supposed to be still alive; and the links to be as fine as those between the finest varieties. in this case it would be quite impossible to give any definition by which the several members of the several groups could be distinguished from their more immediate parents; or these parents from their ancient and unknown progenitor. yet the natural arrangement in the diagram would still hold good; and, on the principle of inheritance, all the forms descended from a, or from i, would have something in common. in a tree we can specify this or that branch, though at the actual fork the two unite and blend together. we could not, as i have said, define the several groups; but we could pick out types, or forms, representing most of the characters of each group, whether large or small, and thus give a general idea of the value of the differences between them. this is what we should be driven to, if we were ever to succeed in collecting all the forms in any class which have lived throughout all time and space. we shall certainly never succeed in making so perfect a collection: nevertheless, in certain classes, we are tending in this direction; and milne edwards has lately insisted, in an able paper, on the high importance of looking to types, whether or not we can separate and define the groups to which such types belong. finally, we have seen that natural selection, which results from the struggle for existence, and which almost inevitably induces extinction and divergence of character in the many descendants from one dominant parent-species, explains that great and universal feature in the affinities of all organic beings, namely, their subordination in group under group. we use the element of descent in classing the individuals of both sexes and of all ages, although having few characters in common, under one species; we use descent in classing acknowledged varieties, however different they may be from their parent; and i believe this element of descent is the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have sought under the term of the natural system. on this idea of the natural system being, in so far as it has been perfected, genealogical in its arrangement, with the grades of difference between the descendants from a common parent, expressed by the terms genera, families, orders, etc., we can understand the rules which we are compelled to follow in our classification. we can understand why we value certain resemblances far more than others; why we are permitted to use rudimentary and useless organs, or others of trifling physiological importance; why, in comparing one group with a distinct group, we summarily reject analogical or adaptive characters, and yet use these same characters within the limits of the same group. we can clearly see how it is that all living and extinct forms can be grouped together in one great system; and how the several members of each class are connected together by the most complex and radiating lines of affinities. we shall never, probably, disentangle the inextricable web of affinities between the members of any one class; but when we have a distinct object in view, and do not look to some unknown plan of creation, we may hope to make sure but slow progress. morphology. we have seen that the members of the same class, independently of their habits of life, resemble each other in the general plan of their organisation. this resemblance is often expressed by the term "unity of type;" or by saying that the several parts and organs in the different species of the class are homologous. the whole subject is included under the general name of morphology. this is the most interesting department of natural history, and may be said to be its very soul. what can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions? geoffroy st. hilaire has insisted strongly on the high importance of relative connexion in homologous organs: the parts may change to almost any extent in form and size, and yet they always remain connected together in the same order. we never find, for instance, the bones of the arm and forearm, or of the thigh and leg, transposed. hence the same names can be given to the homologous bones in widely different animals. we see the same great law in the construction of the mouths of insects: what can be more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a sphinx-moth, the curious folded one of a bee or bug, and the great jaws of a beetle?--yet all these organs, serving for such different purposes, are formed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae. analogous laws govern the construction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans. so it is with the flowers of plants. nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity of pattern in members of the same class, by utility or by the doctrine of final causes. the hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly admitted by owen in his most interesting work on the 'nature of limbs.' on the ordinary view of the independent creation of each being, we can only say that so it is;--that it has so pleased the creator to construct each animal and plant. the explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight modifications,--each modification being profitable in some way to the modified form, but often affecting by correlation of growth other parts of the organisation. in changes of this nature, there will be little or no tendency to modify the original pattern, or to transpose parts. the bones of a limb might be shortened and widened to any extent, and become gradually enveloped in thick membrane, so as to serve as a fin; or a webbed foot might have all its bones, or certain bones, lengthened to any extent, and the membrane connecting them increased to any extent, so as to serve as a wing: yet in all this great amount of modification there will be no tendency to alter the framework of bones or the relative connexion of the several parts. if we suppose that the ancient progenitor, the archetype as it may be called, of all mammals, had its limbs constructed on the existing general pattern, for whatever purpose they served, we can at once perceive the plain signification of the homologous construction of the limbs throughout the whole class. so with the mouths of insects, we have only to suppose that their common progenitor had an upper lip, mandibles, and two pair of maxillae, these parts being perhaps very simple in form; and then natural selection will account for the infinite diversity in structure and function of the mouths of insects. nevertheless, it is conceivable that the general pattern of an organ might become so much obscured as to be finally lost, by the atrophy and ultimately by the complete abortion of certain parts, by the soldering together of other parts, and by the doubling or multiplication of others,--variations which we know to be within the limits of possibility. in the paddles of the extinct gigantic sea-lizards, and in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans, the general pattern seems to have been thus to a certain extent obscured. there is another and equally curious branch of the present subject; namely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual. most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with--that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with--the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. the anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. we see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. it is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible on the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. in monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals, and in flowers, that organs, which when mature become extremely different, are at an early stage of growth exactly alike. how inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone? as owen has remarked, the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds. why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes? why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual flower, though fitted for such widely different purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern? on the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these questions. in the vertebrata, we see a series of internal vertebrae bearing certain processes and appendages; in the articulata, we see the body divided into a series of segments, bearing external appendages; and in flowering plants, we see a series of successive spiral whorls of leaves. an indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common characteristic (as owen has observed) of all low or little-modified forms; therefore we may readily believe that the unknown progenitor of the vertebrata possessed many vertebrae; the unknown progenitor of the articulata, many segments; and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants, many spiral whorls of leaves. we have formerly seen that parts many times repeated are eminently liable to vary in number and structure; consequently it is quite probable that natural selection, during a long-continued course of modification, should have seized on a certain number of the primordially similar elements, many times repeated, and have adapted them to the most diverse purposes. and as the whole amount of modification will have been effected by slight successive steps, we need not wonder at discovering in such parts or organs, a certain degree of fundamental resemblance, retained by the strong principle of inheritance. in the great class of molluscs, though we can homologise the parts of one species with those of another and distinct species, we can indicate but few serial homologies; that is, we are seldom enabled to say that one part or organ is homologous with another in the same individual. and we can understand this fact; for in molluscs, even in the lowest members of the class, we do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition of any one part, as we find in the other great classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. naturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed vertebrae: the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs; the stamens and pistils of flowers as metamorphosed leaves; but it would in these cases probably be more correct, as professor huxley has remarked, to speak of both skull and vertebrae, both jaws and legs, etc.,--as having been metamorphosed, not one from the other, but from some common element. naturalists, however, use such language only in a metaphorical sense: they are far from meaning that during a long course of descent, primordial organs of any kind--vertebrae in the one case and legs in the other--have actually been modified into skulls or jaws. yet so strong is the appearance of a modification of this nature having occurred, that naturalists can hardly avoid employing language having this plain signification. on my view these terms may be used literally; and the wonderful fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab retaining numerous characters, which they would probably have retained through inheritance, if they had really been metamorphosed during a long course of descent from true legs, or from some simple appendage, is explained. embryology. it has already been casually remarked that certain organs in the individual, which when mature become widely different and serve for different purposes, are in the embryo exactly alike. the embryos, also, of distinct animals within the same class are often strikingly similar: a better proof of this cannot be given, than a circumstance mentioned by agassiz, namely, that having forgotten to ticket the embryo of some vertebrate animal, he cannot now tell whether it be that of a mammal, bird, or reptile. the vermiform larvae of moths, flies, beetles, etc., resemble each other much more closely than do the mature insects; but in the case of larvae, the embryos are active, and have been adapted for special lines of life. a trace of the law of embryonic resemblance, sometimes lasts till a rather late age: thus birds of the same genus, and of closely allied genera, often resemble each other in their first and second plumage; as we see in the spotted feathers in the thrush group. in the cat tribe, most of the species are striped or spotted in lines; and stripes can be plainly distinguished in the whelp of the lion. we occasionally though rarely see something of this kind in plants: thus the embryonic leaves of the ulex or furze, and the first leaves of the phyllodineous acaceas, are pinnate or divided like the ordinary leaves of the leguminosae. the points of structure, in which the embryos of widely different animals of the same class resemble each other, often have no direct relation to their conditions of existence. we cannot, for instance, suppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop-like course of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similar conditions,--in the young mammal which is nourished in the womb of its mother, in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest, and in the spawn of a frog under water. we have no more reason to believe in such a relation, than we have to believe that the same bones in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, and fin of a porpoise, are related to similar conditions of life. no one will suppose that the stripes on the whelp of a lion, or the spots on the young blackbird, are of any use to these animals, or are related to the conditions to which they are exposed. the case, however, is different when an animal during any part of its embryonic career is active, and has to provide for itself. the period of activity may come on earlier or later in life; but whenever it comes on, the adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as perfect and as beautiful as in the adult animal. from such special adaptations, the similarity of the larvae or active embryos of allied animals is sometimes much obscured; and cases could be given of the larvae of two species, or of two groups of species, differing quite as much, or even more, from each other than do their adult parents. in most cases, however, the larvae, though active, still obey more or less closely the law of common embryonic resemblance. cirripedes afford a good instance of this: even the illustrious cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was, as it certainly is, a crustacean; but a glance at the larva shows this to be the case in an unmistakeable manner. so again the two main divisions of cirripedes, the pedunculated and sessile, which differ widely in external appearance, have larvae in all their several stages barely distinguishable. the embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation: i use this expression, though i am aware that it is hardly possible to define clearly what is meant by the organisation being higher or lower. but no one probably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than the caterpillar. in some cases, however, the mature animal is generally considered as lower in the scale than the larva, as with certain parasitic crustaceans. to refer once again to cirripedes: the larvae in the first stage have three pairs of legs, a very simple single eye, and a probosciformed mouth, with which they feed largely, for they increase much in size. in the second stage, answering to the chrysalis stage of butterflies, they have six pairs of beautifully constructed natatory legs, a pair of magnificent compound eyes, and extremely complex antennae; but they have a closed and imperfect mouth, and cannot feed: their function at this stage is, to search by their well-developed organs of sense, and to reach by their active powers of swimming, a proper place on which to become attached and to undergo their final metamorphosis. when this is completed they are fixed for life: their legs are now converted into prehensile organs; they again obtain a well-constructed mouth; but they have no antennae, and their two eyes are now reconverted into a minute, single, and very simple eye-spot. in this last and complete state, cirripedes may be considered as either more highly or more lowly organised than they were in the larval condition. but in some genera the larvae become developed either into hermaphrodites having the ordinary structure, or into what i have called complemental males: and in the latter, the development has assuredly been retrograde; for the male is a mere sack, which lives for a short time, and is destitute of mouth, stomach, or other organ of importance, excepting for reproduction. we are so much accustomed to see differences in structure between the embryo and the adult, and likewise a close similarity in the embryos of widely different animals within the same class, that we might be led to look at these facts as necessarily contingent in some manner on growth. but there is no obvious reason why, for instance, the wing of a bat, or the fin of a porpoise, should not have been sketched out with all the parts in proper proportion, as soon as any structure became visible in the embryo. and in some whole groups of animals and in certain members of other groups, the embryo does not at any period differ widely from the adult: thus owen has remarked in regard to cuttle-fish, "there is no metamorphosis; the cephalopodic character is manifested long before the parts of the embryo are completed;" and again in spiders, "there is nothing worthy to be called a metamorphosis." the larvae of insects, whether adapted to the most diverse and active habits, or quite inactive, being fed by their parents or placed in the midst of proper nutriment, yet nearly all pass through a similar worm-like stage of development; but in some few cases, as in that of aphis, if we look to the admirable drawings by professor huxley of the development of this insect, we see no trace of the vermiform stage. how, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology,--namely the very general, but not universal difference in structure between the embryo and the adult;--of parts in the same individual embryo, which ultimately become very unlike and serve for diverse purposes, being at this early period of growth alike;--of embryos of different species within the same class, generally, but not universally, resembling each other;--of the structure of the embryo not being closely related to its conditions of existence, except when the embryo becomes at any period of life active and has to provide for itself;--of the embryo apparently having sometimes a higher organisation than the mature animal, into which it is developed. i believe that all these facts can be explained, as follows, on the view of descent with modification. it is commonly assumed, perhaps from monstrosities often affecting the embryo at a very early period, that slight variations necessarily appear at an equally early period. but we have little evidence on this head--indeed the evidence rather points the other way; for it is notorious that breeders of cattle, horses, and various fancy animals, cannot positively tell, until some time after the animal has been born, what its merits or form will ultimately turn out. we see this plainly in our own children; we cannot always tell whether the child will be tall or short, or what its precise features will be. the question is not, at what period of life any variation has been caused, but at what period it is fully displayed. the cause may have acted, and i believe generally has acted, even before the embryo is formed; and the variation may be due to the male and female sexual elements having been affected by the conditions to which either parent, or their ancestors, have been exposed. nevertheless an effect thus caused at a very early period, even before the formation of the embryo, may appear late in life; as when an hereditary disease, which appears in old age alone, has been communicated to the offspring from the reproductive element of one parent. or again, as when the horns of cross-bred cattle have been affected by the shape of the horns of either parent. for the welfare of a very young animal, as long as it remains in its mother's womb, or in the egg, or as long as it is nourished and protected by its parent, it must be quite unimportant whether most of its characters are fully acquired a little earlier or later in life. it would not signify, for instance, to a bird which obtained its food best by having a long beak, whether or not it assumed a beak of this particular length, as long as it was fed by its parents. hence, i conclude, that it is quite possible, that each of the many successive modifications, by which each species has acquired its present structure, may have supervened at a not very early period of life; and some direct evidence from our domestic animals supports this view. but in other cases it is quite possible that each successive modification, or most of them, may have appeared at an extremely early period. i have stated in the first chapter, that there is some evidence to render it probable, that at whatever age any variation first appears in the parent, it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring. certain variations can only appear at corresponding ages, for instance, peculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago states of the silk-moth; or, again, in the horns of almost full-grown cattle. but further than this, variations which, for all that we can see, might have appeared earlier or later in life, tend to appear at a corresponding age in the offspring and parent. i am far from meaning that this is invariably the case; and i could give a good many cases of variations (taking the word in the largest sense) which have supervened at an earlier age in the child than in the parent. these two principles, if their truth be admitted, will, i believe, explain all the above specified leading facts in embryology. but first let us look at a few analogous cases in domestic varieties. some authors who have written on dogs, maintain that the greyhound and bulldog, though appearing so different, are really varieties most closely allied, and have probably descended from the same wild stock; hence i was curious to see how far their puppies differed from each other: i was told by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents, and this, judging by the eye, seemed almost to be the case; but on actually measuring the old dogs and their six-days old puppies, i found that the puppies had not nearly acquired their full amount of proportional difference. so, again, i was told that the foals of cart and race-horses differed as much as the full-grown animals; and this surprised me greatly, as i think it probable that the difference between these two breeds has been wholly caused by selection under domestication; but having had careful measurements made of the dam and of a three-days old colt of a race and heavy cart-horse, i find that the colts have by no means acquired their full amount of proportional difference. as the evidence appears to me conclusive, that the several domestic breeds of pigeon have descended from one wild species, i compared young pigeons of various breeds, within twelve hours after being hatched; i carefully measured the proportions (but will not here give details) of the beak, width of mouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of feet and length of leg, in the wild stock, in pouters, fantails, runts, barbs, dragons, carriers, and tumblers. now some of these birds, when mature, differ so extraordinarily in length and form of beak, that they would, i cannot doubt, be ranked in distinct genera, had they been natural productions. but when the nestling birds of these several breeds were placed in a row, though most of them could be distinguished from each other, yet their proportional differences in the above specified several points were incomparably less than in the full-grown birds. some characteristic points of difference--for instance, that of the width of mouth--could hardly be detected in the young. but there was one remarkable exception to this rule, for the young of the short-faced tumbler differed from the young of the wild rock-pigeon and of the other breeds, in all its proportions, almost exactly as much as in the adult state. the two principles above given seem to me to explain these facts in regard to the later embryonic stages of our domestic varieties. fanciers select their horses, dogs, and pigeons, for breeding, when they are nearly grown up: they are indifferent whether the desired qualities and structures have been acquired earlier or later in life, if the full-grown animal possesses them. and the cases just given, more especially that of pigeons, seem to show that the characteristic differences which give value to each breed, and which have been accumulated by man's selection, have not generally first appeared at an early period of life, and have been inherited by the offspring at a corresponding not early period. but the case of the short-faced tumbler, which when twelve hours old had acquired its proper proportions, proves that this is not the universal rule; for here the characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier period than usual, or, if not so, the differences must have been inherited, not at the corresponding, but at an earlier age. now let us apply these facts and the above two principles--which latter, though not proved true, can be shown to be in some degree probable--to species in a state of nature. let us take a genus of birds, descended on my theory from some one parent-species, and of which the several new species have become modified through natural selection in accordance with their diverse habits. then, from the many slight successive steps of variation having supervened at a rather late age, and having been inherited at a corresponding age, the young of the new species of our supposed genus will manifestly tend to resemble each other much more closely than do the adults, just as we have seen in the case of pigeons. we may extend this view to whole families or even classes. the fore-limbs, for instance, which served as legs in the parent-species, may become, by a long course of modification, adapted in one descendant to act as hands, in another as paddles, in another as wings; and on the above two principles--namely of each successive modification supervening at a rather late age, and being inherited at a corresponding late age--the fore-limbs in the embryos of the several descendants of the parent-species will still resemble each other closely, for they will not have been modified. but in each individual new species, the embryonic fore-limbs will differ greatly from the fore-limbs in the mature animal; the limbs in the latter having undergone much modification at a rather late period of life, and having thus been converted into hands, or paddles, or wings. whatever influence long-continued exercise or use on the one hand, and disuse on the other, may have in modifying an organ, such influence will mainly affect the mature animal, which has come to its full powers of activity and has to gain its own living; and the effects thus produced will be inherited at a corresponding mature age. whereas the young will remain unmodified, or be modified in a lesser degree, by the effects of use and disuse. in certain cases the successive steps of variation might supervene, from causes of which we are wholly ignorant, at a very early period of life, or each step might be inherited at an earlier period than that at which it first appeared. in either case (as with the short-faced tumbler) the young or embryo would closely resemble the mature parent-form. we have seen that this is the rule of development in certain whole groups of animals, as with cuttle-fish and spiders, and with a few members of the great class of insects, as with aphis. with respect to the final cause of the young in these cases not undergoing any metamorphosis, or closely resembling their parents from their earliest age, we can see that this would result from the two following contingencies; firstly, from the young, during a course of modification carried on for many generations, having to provide for their own wants at a very early stage of development, and secondly, from their following exactly the same habits of life with their parents; for in this case, it would be indispensable for the existence of the species, that the child should be modified at a very early age in the same manner with its parents, in accordance with their similar habits. some further explanation, however, of the embryo not undergoing any metamorphosis is perhaps requisite. if, on the other hand, it profited the young to follow habits of life in any degree different from those of their parent, and consequently to be constructed in a slightly different manner, then, on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages, the active young or larvae might easily be rendered by natural selection different to any conceivable extent from their parents. such differences might, also, become correlated with successive stages of development; so that the larvae, in the first stage, might differ greatly from the larvae in the second stage, as we have seen to be the case with cirripedes. the adult might become fitted for sites or habits, in which organs of locomotion or of the senses, etc., would be useless; and in this case the final metamorphosis would be said to be retrograde. as all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived on this earth have to be classed together, and as all have been connected by the finest gradations, the best, or indeed, if our collections were nearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical. descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the natural system. on this view we can understand how it is that, in the eyes of most naturalists, the structure of the embryo is even more important for classification than that of the adult. for the embryo is the animal in its less modified state; and in so far it reveals the structure of its progenitor. in two groups of animal, however much they may at present differ from each other in structure and habits, if they pass through the same or similar embryonic stages, we may feel assured that they have both descended from the same or nearly similar parents, and are therefore in that degree closely related. thus, community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent. it will reveal this community of descent, however much the structure of the adult may have been modified and obscured; we have seen, for instance, that cirripedes can at once be recognised by their larvae as belonging to the great class of crustaceans. as the embryonic state of each species and group of species partially shows us the structure of their less modified ancient progenitors, we can clearly see why ancient and extinct forms of life should resemble the embryos of their descendants,--our existing species. agassiz believes this to be a law of nature; but i am bound to confess that i only hope to see the law hereafter proved true. it can be proved true in those cases alone in which the ancient state, now supposed to be represented in many embryos, has not been obliterated, either by the successive variations in a long course of modification having supervened at a very early age, or by the variations having been inherited at an earlier period than that at which they first appeared. it should also be borne in mind, that the supposed law of resemblance of ancient forms of life to the embryonic stages of recent forms, may be true, but yet, owing to the geological record not extending far enough back in time, may remain for a long period, or for ever, incapable of demonstration. thus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which are second in importance to none in natural history, are explained on the principle of slight modifications not appearing, in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor, at a very early period in the life of each, though perhaps caused at the earliest, and being inherited at a corresponding not early period. embryology rises greatly in interest, when we thus look at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the common parent-form of each great class of animals. rudimentary, atrophied, or aborted organs. organs or parts in this strange condition, bearing the stamp of inutility, are extremely common throughout nature. for instance, rudimentary mammae are very general in the males of mammals: i presume that the "bastard-wing" in birds may be safely considered as a digit in a rudimentary state: in very many snakes one lobe of the lungs is rudimentary; in other snakes there are rudiments of the pelvis and hind limbs. some of the cases of rudimentary organs are extremely curious; for instance, the presence of teeth in foetal whales, which when grown up have not a tooth in their heads; and the presence of teeth, which never cut through the gums, in the upper jaws of our unborn calves. it has even been stated on good authority that rudiments of teeth can be detected in the beaks of certain embryonic birds. nothing can be plainer than that wings are formed for flight, yet in how many insects do we see wings so reduced in size as to be utterly incapable of flight, and not rarely lying under wing-cases, firmly soldered together! the meaning of rudimentary organs is often quite unmistakeable: for instance there are beetles of the same genus (and even of the same species) resembling each other most closely in all respects, one of which will have full-sized wings, and another mere rudiments of membrane; and here it is impossible to doubt, that the rudiments represent wings. rudimentary organs sometimes retain their potentiality, and are merely not developed: this seems to be the case with the mammae of male mammals, for many instances are on record of these organs having become well developed in full-grown males, and having secreted milk. so again there are normally four developed and two rudimentary teats in the udders of the genus bos, but in our domestic cows the two sometimes become developed and give milk. in individual plants of the same species the petals sometimes occur as mere rudiments, and sometimes in a well-developed state. in plants with separated sexes, the male flowers often have a rudiment of a pistil; and kolreuter found that by crossing such male plants with an hermaphrodite species, the rudiment of the pistil in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size; and this shows that the rudiment and the perfect pistil are essentially alike in nature. an organ serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or utterly aborted for one, even the more important purpose; and remain perfectly efficient for the other. thus in plants, the office of the pistil is to allow the pollen-tubes to reach the ovules protected in the ovarium at its base. the pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style; but in some compositae, the male florets, which of course cannot be fecundated, have a pistil, which is in a rudimentary state, for it is not crowned with a stigma; but the style remains well developed, and is clothed with hairs as in other compositae, for the purpose of brushing the pollen out of the surrounding anthers. again, an organ may become rudimentary for its proper purpose, and be used for a distinct object: in certain fish the swim-bladder seems to be rudimentary for its proper function of giving buoyancy, but has become converted into a nascent breathing organ or lung. other similar instances could be given. rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very liable to vary in degree of development and in other respects. moreover, in closely allied species, the degree to which the same organ has been rendered rudimentary occasionally differs much. this latter fact is well exemplified in the state of the wings of the female moths in certain groups. rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted; and this implies, that we find in an animal or plant no trace of an organ, which analogy would lead us to expect to find, and which is occasionally found in monstrous individuals of the species. thus in the snapdragon (antirrhinum) we generally do not find a rudiment of a fifth stamen; but this may sometimes be seen. in tracing the homologies of the same part in different members of a class, nothing is more common, or more necessary, than the use and discovery of rudiments. this is well shown in the drawings given by owen of the bones of the leg of the horse, ox, and rhinoceros. it is an important fact that rudimentary organs, such as teeth in the upper jaws of whales and ruminants, can often be detected in the embryo, but afterwards wholly disappear. it is also, i believe, a universal rule, that a rudimentary part or organ is of greater size relatively to the adjoining parts in the embryo, than in the adult; so that the organ at this early age is less rudimentary, or even cannot be said to be in any degree rudimentary. hence, also, a rudimentary organ in the adult, is often said to have retained its embryonic condition. i have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs. in reflecting on them, every one must be struck with astonishment: for the same reasoning power which tells us plainly that most parts and organs are exquisitely adapted for certain purposes, tells us with equal plainness that these rudimentary or atrophied organs, are imperfect and useless. in works on natural history rudimentary organs are generally said to have been created "for the sake of symmetry," or in order "to complete the scheme of nature;" but this seems to me no explanation, merely a restatement of the fact. would it be thought sufficient to say that because planets revolve in elliptic courses round the sun, satellites follow the same course round the planets, for the sake of symmetry, and to complete the scheme of nature? an eminent physiologist accounts for the presence of rudimentary organs, by supposing that they serve to excrete matter in excess, or injurious to the system; but can we suppose that the minute papilla, which often represents the pistil in male flowers, and which is formed merely of cellular tissue, can thus act? can we suppose that the formation of rudimentary teeth which are subsequently absorbed, can be of any service to the rapidly growing embryonic calf by the excretion of precious phosphate of lime? when a man's fingers have been amputated, imperfect nails sometimes appear on the stumps: i could as soon believe that these vestiges of nails have appeared, not from unknown laws of growth, but in order to excrete horny matter, as that the rudimentary nails on the fin of the manatee were formed for this purpose. on my view of descent with modification, the origin of rudimentary organs is simple. we have plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in our domestic productions,--as the stump of a tail in tailless breeds,--the vestige of an ear in earless breeds,--the reappearance of minute dangling horns in hornless breeds of cattle, more especially, according to youatt, in young animals,--and the state of the whole flower in the cauliflower. we often see rudiments of various parts in monsters. but i doubt whether any of these cases throw light on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of nature, further than by showing that rudiments can be produced; for i doubt whether species under nature ever undergo abrupt changes. i believe that disuse has been the main agency; that it has led in successive generations to the gradual reduction of various organs, until they have become rudimentary,--as in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark caverns, and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands, which have seldom been forced to take flight, and have ultimately lost the power of flying. again, an organ useful under certain conditions, might become injurious under others, as with the wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands; and in this case natural selection would continue slowly to reduce the organ, until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary. any change in function, which can be effected by insensibly small steps, is within the power of natural selection; so that an organ rendered, during changed habits of life, useless or injurious for one purpose, might easily be modified and used for another purpose. or an organ might be retained for one alone of its former functions. an organ, when rendered useless, may well be variable, for its variations cannot be checked by natural selection. at whatever period of life disuse or selection reduces an organ, and this will generally be when the being has come to maturity and to its full powers of action, the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages will reproduce the organ in its reduced state at the same age, and consequently will seldom affect or reduce it in the embryo. thus we can understand the greater relative size of rudimentary organs in the embryo, and their lesser relative size in the adult. but if each step of the process of reduction were to be inherited, not at the corresponding age, but at an extremely early period of life (as we have good reason to believe to be possible) the rudimentary part would tend to be wholly lost, and we should have a case of complete abortion. the principle, also, of economy, explained in a former chapter, by which the materials forming any part or structure, if not useful to the possessor, will be saved as far as is possible, will probably often come into play; and this will tend to cause the entire obliteration of a rudimentary organ. as the presence of rudimentary organs is thus due to the tendency in every part of the organisation, which has long existed, to be inherited--we can understand, on the genealogical view of classification, how it is that systematists have found rudimentary parts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than, parts of high physiological importance. rudimentary organs may be compared with the letters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but become useless in the pronunciation, but which serve as a clue in seeking for its derivation. on the view of descent with modification, we may conclude that the existence of organs in a rudimentary, imperfect, and useless condition, or quite aborted, far from presenting a strange difficulty, as they assuredly do on the ordinary doctrine of creation, might even have been anticipated, and can be accounted for by the laws of inheritance. summary. in this chapter i have attempted to show, that the subordination of group to group in all organisms throughout all time; that the nature of the relationship, by which all living and extinct beings are united by complex, radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand system; the rules followed and the difficulties encountered by naturalists in their classifications; the value set upon characters, if constant and prevalent, whether of high vital importance, or of the most trifling importance, or, as in rudimentary organs, of no importance; the wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive characters, and characters of true affinity; and other such rules;--all naturally follow on the view of the common parentage of those forms which are considered by naturalists as allied, together with their modification through natural selection, with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of character. in considering this view of classification, it should be borne in mind that the element of descent has been universally used in ranking together the sexes, ages, and acknowledged varieties of the same species, however different they may be in structure. if we extend the use of this element of descent,--the only certainly known cause of similarity in organic beings,--we shall understand what is meant by the natural system: it is genealogical in its attempted arrangement, with the grades of acquired difference marked by the terms varieties, species, genera, families, orders, and classes. on this same view of descent with modification, all the great facts in morphology become intelligible,--whether we look to the same pattern displayed in the homologous organs, to whatever purpose applied, of the different species of a class; or to the homologous parts constructed on the same pattern in each individual animal and plant. on the principle of successive slight variations, not necessarily or generally supervening at a very early period of life, and being inherited at a corresponding period, we can understand the great leading facts in embryology; namely, the resemblance in an individual embryo of the homologous parts, which when matured will become widely different from each other in structure and function; and the resemblance in different species of a class of the homologous parts or organs, though fitted in the adult members for purposes as different as possible. larvae are active embryos, which have become specially modified in relation to their habits of life, through the principle of modifications being inherited at corresponding ages. on this same principle--and bearing in mind, that when organs are reduced in size, either from disuse or selection, it will generally be at that period of life when the being has to provide for its own wants, and bearing in mind how strong is the principle of inheritance--the occurrence of rudimentary organs and their final abortion, present to us no inexplicable difficulties; on the contrary, their presence might have been even anticipated. the importance of embryological characters and of rudimentary organs in classification is intelligible, on the view that an arrangement is only so far natural as it is genealogical. finally, the several classes of facts which have been considered in this chapter, seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the innumerable species, genera, and families of organic beings, with which this world is peopled, have all descended, each within its own class or group, from common parents, and have all been modified in the course of descent, that i should without hesitation adopt this view, even if it were unsupported by other facts or arguments. 14. recapitulation and conclusion. recapitulation of the difficulties on the theory of natural selection. recapitulation of the general and special circumstances in its favour. causes of the general belief in the immutability of species. how far the theory of natural selection may be extended. effects of its adoption on the study of natural history. concluding remarks. as this whole volume is one long argument, it may be convenient to the reader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated. that many and grave objections may be advanced against the theory of descent with modification through natural selection, i do not deny. i have endeavoured to give to them their full force. nothing at first can appear more difficult to believe than that the more complex organs and instincts should have been perfected, not by means superior to, though analogous with, human reason, but by the accumulation of innumerable slight variations, each good for the individual possessor. nevertheless, this difficulty, though appearing to our imagination insuperably great, cannot be considered real if we admit the following propositions, namely,--that gradations in the perfection of any organ or instinct, which we may consider, either do now exist or could have existed, each good of its kind,--that all organs and instincts are, in ever so slight a degree, variable,--and, lastly, that there is a struggle for existence leading to the preservation of each profitable deviation of structure or instinct. the truth of these propositions cannot, i think, be disputed. it is, no doubt, extremely difficult even to conjecture by what gradations many structures have been perfected, more especially amongst broken and failing groups of organic beings; but we see so many strange gradations in nature, as is proclaimed by the canon, "natura non facit saltum," that we ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or instinct, or any whole being, could not have arrived at its present state by many graduated steps. there are, it must be admitted, cases of special difficulty on the theory of natural selection; and one of the most curious of these is the existence of two or three defined castes of workers or sterile females in the same community of ants; but i have attempted to show how this difficulty can be mastered. with respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first crossed, which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal fertility of varieties when crossed, i must refer the reader to the recapitulation of the facts given at the end of the eighth chapter, which seem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a special endowment than is the incapacity of two trees to be grafted together, but that it is incidental on constitutional differences in the reproductive systems of the intercrossed species. we see the truth of this conclusion in the vast difference in the result, when the same two species are crossed reciprocally; that is, when one species is first used as the father and then as the mother. the fertility of varieties when intercrossed and of their mongrel offspring cannot be considered as universal; nor is their very general fertility surprising when we remember that it is not likely that either their constitutions or their reproductive systems should have been profoundly modified. moreover, most of the varieties which have been experimentised on have been produced under domestication; and as domestication apparently tends to eliminate sterility, we ought not to expect it also to produce sterility. the sterility of hybrids is a very different case from that of first crosses, for their reproductive organs are more or less functionally impotent; whereas in first crosses the organs on both sides are in a perfect condition. as we continually see that organisms of all kinds are rendered in some degree sterile from their constitutions having been disturbed by slightly different and new conditions of life, we need not feel surprise at hybrids being in some degree sterile, for their constitutions can hardly fail to have been disturbed from being compounded of two distinct organisations. this parallelism is supported by another parallel, but directly opposite, class of facts; namely, that the vigour and fertility of all organic beings are increased by slight changes in their conditions of life, and that the offspring of slightly modified forms or varieties acquire from being crossed increased vigour and fertility. so that, on the one hand, considerable changes in the conditions of life and crosses between greatly modified forms, lessen fertility; and on the other hand, lesser changes in the conditions of life and crosses between less modified forms, increase fertility. turning to geographical distribution, the difficulties encountered on the theory of descent with modification are grave enough. all the individuals of the same species, and all the species of the same genus, or even higher group, must have descended from common parents; and therefore, in however distant and isolated parts of the world they are now found, they must in the course of successive generations have passed from some one part to the others. we are often wholly unable even to conjecture how this could have been effected. yet, as we have reason to believe that some species have retained the same specific form for very long periods, enormously long as measured by years, too much stress ought not to be laid on the occasional wide diffusion of the same species; for during very long periods of time there will always be a good chance for wide migration by many means. a broken or interrupted range may often be accounted for by the extinction of the species in the intermediate regions. it cannot be denied that we are as yet very ignorant of the full extent of the various climatal and geographical changes which have affected the earth during modern periods; and such changes will obviously have greatly facilitated migration. as an example, i have attempted to show how potent has been the influence of the glacial period on the distribution both of the same and of representative species throughout the world. we are as yet profoundly ignorant of the many occasional means of transport. with respect to distinct species of the same genus inhabiting very distant and isolated regions, as the process of modification has necessarily been slow, all the means of migration will have been possible during a very long period; and consequently the difficulty of the wide diffusion of species of the same genus is in some degree lessened. as on the theory of natural selection an interminable number of intermediate forms must have existed, linking together all the species in each group by gradations as fine as our present varieties, it may be asked, why do we not see these linking forms all around us? why are not all organic beings blended together in an inextricable chaos? with respect to existing forms, we should remember that we have no right to expect (excepting in rare cases) to discover directly connecting links between them, but only between each and some extinct and supplanted form. even on a wide area, which has during a long period remained continuous, and of which the climate and other conditions of life change insensibly in going from a district occupied by one species into another district occupied by a closely allied species, we have no just right to expect often to find intermediate varieties in the intermediate zone. for we have reason to believe that only a few species are undergoing change at any one period; and all changes are slowly effected. i have also shown that the intermediate varieties which will at first probably exist in the intermediate zones, will be liable to be supplanted by the allied forms on either hand; and the latter, from existing in greater numbers, will generally be modified and improved at a quicker rate than the intermediate varieties, which exist in lesser numbers; so that the intermediate varieties will, in the long run, be supplanted and exterminated. on this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting links, between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world, and at each successive period between the extinct and still older species, why is not every geological formation charged with such links? why does not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and mutation of the forms of life? we meet with no such evidence, and this is the most obvious and forcible of the many objections which may be urged against my theory. why, again, do whole groups of allied species appear, though certainly they often falsely appear, to have come in suddenly on the several geological stages? why do we not find great piles of strata beneath the silurian system, stored with the remains of the progenitors of the silurian groups of fossils? for certainly on my theory such strata must somewhere have been deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs in the world's history. i can answer these questions and grave objections only on the supposition that the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists believe. it cannot be objected that there has not been time sufficient for any amount of organic change; for the lapse of time has been so great as to be utterly inappreciable by the human intellect. the number of specimens in all our museums is absolutely as nothing compared with the countless generations of countless species which certainly have existed. we should not be able to recognise a species as the parent of any one or more species if we were to examine them ever so closely, unless we likewise possessed many of the intermediate links between their past or parent and present states; and these many links we could hardly ever expect to discover, owing to the imperfection of the geological record. numerous existing doubtful forms could be named which are probably varieties; but who will pretend that in future ages so many fossil links will be discovered, that naturalists will be able to decide, on the common view, whether or not these doubtful forms are varieties? as long as most of the links between any two species are unknown, if any one link or intermediate variety be discovered, it will simply be classed as another and distinct species. only a small portion of the world has been geologically explored. only organic beings of certain classes can be preserved in a fossil condition, at least in any great number. widely ranging species vary most, and varieties are often at first local,--both causes rendering the discovery of intermediate links less likely. local varieties will not spread into other and distant regions until they are considerably modified and improved; and when they do spread, if discovered in a geological formation, they will appear as if suddenly created there, and will be simply classed as new species. most formations have been intermittent in their accumulation; and their duration, i am inclined to believe, has been shorter than the average duration of specific forms. successive formations are separated from each other by enormous blank intervals of time; for fossiliferous formations, thick enough to resist future degradation, can be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the subsiding bed of the sea. during the alternate periods of elevation and of stationary level the record will be blank. during these latter periods there will probably be more variability in the forms of life; during periods of subsidence, more extinction. with respect to the absence of fossiliferous formations beneath the lowest silurian strata, i can only recur to the hypothesis given in the ninth chapter. that the geological record is imperfect all will admit; but that it is imperfect to the degree which i require, few will be inclined to admit. if we look to long enough intervals of time, geology plainly declares that all species have changed; and they have changed in the manner which my theory requires, for they have changed slowly and in a graduated manner. we clearly see this in the fossil remains from consecutive formations invariably being much more closely related to each other, than are the fossils from formations distant from each other in time. such is the sum of the several chief objections and difficulties which may justly be urged against my theory; and i have now briefly recapitulated the answers and explanations which can be given to them. i have felt these difficulties far too heavily during many years to doubt their weight. but it deserves especial notice that the more important objections relate to questions on which we are confessedly ignorant; nor do we know how ignorant we are. we do not know all the possible transitional gradations between the simplest and the most perfect organs; it cannot be pretended that we know all the varied means of distribution during the long lapse of years, or that we know how imperfect the geological record is. grave as these several difficulties are, in my judgment they do not overthrow the theory of descent with modification. now let us turn to the other side of the argument. under domestication we see much variability. this seems to be mainly due to the reproductive system being eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life; so that this system, when not rendered impotent, fails to reproduce offspring exactly like the parent-form. variability is governed by many complex laws,--by correlation of growth, by use and disuse, and by the direct action of the physical conditions of life. there is much difficulty in ascertaining how much modification our domestic productions have undergone; but we may safely infer that the amount has been large, and that modifications can be inherited for long periods. as long as the conditions of life remain the same, we have reason to believe that a modification, which has already been inherited for many generations, may continue to be inherited for an almost infinite number of generations. on the other hand we have evidence that variability, when it has once come into play, does not wholly cease; for new varieties are still occasionally produced by our most anciently domesticated productions. man does not actually produce variability; he only unintentionally exposes organic beings to new conditions of life, and then nature acts on the organisation, and causes variability. but man can and does select the variations given to him by nature, and thus accumulate them in any desired manner. he thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or pleasure. he may do this methodically, or he may do it unconsciously by preserving the individuals most useful to him at the time, without any thought of altering the breed. it is certain that he can largely influence the character of a breed by selecting, in each successive generation, individual differences so slight as to be quite inappreciable by an uneducated eye. this process of selection has been the great agency in the production of the most distinct and useful domestic breeds. that many of the breeds produced by man have to a large extent the character of natural species, is shown by the inextricable doubts whether very many of them are varieties or aboriginal species. there is no obvious reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature. in the preservation of favoured individuals and races, during the constantly-recurrent struggle for existence, we see the most powerful and ever-acting means of selection. the struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of increase which is common to all organic beings. this high rate of increase is proved by calculation, by the effects of a succession of peculiar seasons, and by the results of naturalisation, as explained in the third chapter. more individuals are born than can possibly survive. a grain in the balance will determine which individual shall live and which shall die,--which variety or species shall increase in number, and which shall decrease, or finally become extinct. as the individuals of the same species come in all respects into the closest competition with each other, the struggle will generally be most severe between them; it will be almost equally severe between the varieties of the same species, and next in severity between the species of the same genus. but the struggle will often be very severe between beings most remote in the scale of nature. the slightest advantage in one being, at any age or during any season, over those with which it comes into competition, or better adaptation in however slight a degree to the surrounding physical conditions, will turn the balance. with animals having separated sexes there will in most cases be a struggle between the males for possession of the females. the most vigorous individuals, or those which have most successfully struggled with their conditions of life, will generally leave most progeny. but success will often depend on having special weapons or means of defence, or on the charms of the males; and the slightest advantage will lead to victory. as geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physical changes, we might have expected that organic beings would have varied under nature, in the same way as they generally have varied under the changed conditions of domestication. and if there be any variability under nature, it would be an unaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into play. it has often been asserted, but the assertion is quite incapable of proof, that the amount of variation under nature is a strictly limited quantity. man, though acting on external characters alone and often capriciously, can produce within a short period a great result by adding up mere individual differences in his domestic productions; and every one admits that there are at least individual differences in species under nature. but, besides such differences, all naturalists have admitted the existence of varieties, which they think sufficiently distinct to be worthy of record in systematic works. no one can draw any clear distinction between individual differences and slight varieties; or between more plainly marked varieties and sub-species, and species. let it be observed how naturalists differ in the rank which they assign to the many representative forms in europe and north america. if then we have under nature variability and a powerful agent always ready to act and select, why should we doubt that variations in any way useful to beings, under their excessively complex relations of life, would be preserved, accumulated, and inherited? why, if man can by patience select variations most useful to himself, should nature fail in selecting variations useful, under changing conditions of life, to her living products? what limit can be put to this power, acting during long ages and rigidly scrutinising the whole constitution, structure, and habits of each creature,--favouring the good and rejecting the bad? i can see no limit to this power, in slowly and beautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations of life. the theory of natural selection, even if we looked no further than this, seems to me to be in itself probable. i have already recapitulated, as fairly as i could, the opposed difficulties and objections: now let us turn to the special facts and arguments in favour of the theory. on the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties, and that each species first existed as a variety, we can see why it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between species, commonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation, and varieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary laws. on this same view we can understand how it is that in each region where many species of a genus have been produced, and where they now flourish, these same species should present many varieties; for where the manufactory of species has been active, we might expect, as a general rule, to find it still in action; and this is the case if varieties be incipient species. moreover, the species of the larger genera, which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient species, retain to a certain degree the character of varieties; for they differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do the species of smaller genera. the closely allied species also of the larger genera apparently have restricted ranges, and they are clustered in little groups round other species--in which respects they resemble varieties. these are strange relations on the view of each species having been independently created, but are intelligible if all species first existed as varieties. as each species tends by its geometrical ratio of reproduction to increase inordinately in number; and as the modified descendants of each species will be enabled to increase by so much the more as they become more diversified in habits and structure, so as to be enabled to seize on many and widely different places in the economy of nature, there will be a constant tendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent offspring of any one species. hence during a long-continued course of modification, the slight differences, characteristic of varieties of the same species, tend to be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of species of the same genus. new and improved varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older, less improved and intermediate varieties; and thus species are rendered to a large extent defined and distinct objects. dominant species belonging to the larger groups tend to give birth to new and dominant forms; so that each large group tends to become still larger, and at the same time more divergent in character. but as all groups cannot thus succeed in increasing in size, for the world would not hold them, the more dominant groups beat the less dominant. this tendency in the large groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character, together with the almost inevitable contingency of much extinction, explains the arrangement of all the forms of life, in groups subordinate to groups, all within a few great classes, which we now see everywhere around us, and which has prevailed throughout all time. this grand fact of the grouping of all organic beings seems to me utterly inexplicable on the theory of creation. as natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive, favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modification; it can act only by very short and slow steps. hence the canon of "natura non facit saltum," which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to make more strictly correct, is on this theory simply intelligible. we can plainly see why nature is prodigal in variety, though niggard in innovation. but why this should be a law of nature if each species has been independently created, no man can explain. many other facts are, as it seems to me, explicable on this theory. how strange it is that a bird, under the form of woodpecker, should have been created to prey on insects on the ground; that upland geese, which never or rarely swim, should have been created with webbed feet; that a thrush should have been created to dive and feed on sub-aquatic insects; and that a petrel should have been created with habits and structure fitting it for the life of an auk or grebe! and so on in endless other cases. but on the view of each species constantly trying to increase in number, with natural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying descendants of each to any unoccupied or ill-occupied place in nature, these facts cease to be strange, or perhaps might even have been anticipated. as natural selection acts by competition, it adapts the inhabitants of each country only in relation to the degree of perfection of their associates; so that we need feel no surprise at the inhabitants of any one country, although on the ordinary view supposed to have been specially created and adapted for that country, being beaten and supplanted by the naturalised productions from another land. nor ought we to marvel if all the contrivances in nature be not, as far as we can judge, absolutely perfect; and if some of them be abhorrent to our ideas of fitness. we need not marvel at the sting of the bee causing the bee's own death; at drones being produced in such vast numbers for one single act, and being then slaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the astonishing waste of pollen by our fir-trees; at the instinctive hatred of the queen bee for her own fertile daughters; at ichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars; and at other such cases. the wonder indeed is, on the theory of natural selection, that more cases of the want of absolute perfection have not been observed. the complex and little known laws governing variation are the same, as far as we can see, with the laws which have governed the production of so-called specific forms. in both cases physical conditions seem to have produced but little direct effect; yet when varieties enter any zone, they occasionally assume some of the characters of the species proper to that zone. in both varieties and species, use and disuse seem to have produced some effect; for it is difficult to resist this conclusion when we look, for instance, at the logger-headed duck, which has wings incapable of flight, in nearly the same condition as in the domestic duck; or when we look at the burrowing tucutucu, which is occasionally blind, and then at certain moles, which are habitually blind and have their eyes covered with skin; or when we look at the blind animals inhabiting the dark caves of america and europe. in both varieties and species correlation of growth seems to have played a most important part, so that when one part has been modified other parts are necessarily modified. in both varieties and species reversions to long-lost characters occur. how inexplicable on the theory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulder and legs of the several species of the horse-genus and in their hybrids! how simply is this fact explained if we believe that these species have descended from a striped progenitor, in the same manner as the several domestic breeds of pigeon have descended from the blue and barred rock-pigeon! on the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, why should the specific characters, or those by which the species of the same genus differ from each other, be more variable than the generic characters in which they all agree? why, for instance, should the colour of a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a genus, if the other species, supposed to have been created independently, have differently coloured flowers, than if all the species of the genus have the same coloured flowers? if species are only well-marked varieties, of which the characters have become in a high degree permanent, we can understand this fact; for they have already varied since they branched off from a common progenitor in certain characters, by which they have come to be specifically distinct from each other; and therefore these same characters would be more likely still to be variable than the generic characters which have been inherited without change for an enormous period. it is inexplicable on the theory of creation why a part developed in a very unusual manner in any one species of a genus, and therefore, as we may naturally infer, of great importance to the species, should be eminently liable to variation; but, on my view, this part has undergone, since the several species branched off from a common progenitor, an unusual amount of variability and modification, and therefore we might expect this part generally to be still variable. but a part may be developed in the most unusual manner, like the wing of a bat, and yet not be more variable than any other structure, if the part be common to many subordinate forms, that is, if it has been inherited for a very long period; for in this case it will have been rendered constant by long-continued natural selection. glancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, they offer no greater difficulty than does corporeal structure on the theory of the natural selection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications. we can thus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing different animals of the same class with their several instincts. i have attempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throws on the admirable architectural powers of the hive-bee. habit no doubt sometimes comes into play in modifying instincts; but it certainly is not indispensable, as we see, in the case of neuter insects, which leave no progeny to inherit the effects of long-continued habit. on the view of all the species of the same genus having descended from a common parent, and having inherited much in common, we can understand how it is that allied species, when placed under considerably different conditions of life, yet should follow nearly the same instincts; why the thrush of south america, for instance, lines her nest with mud like our british species. on the view of instincts having been slowly acquired through natural selection we need not marvel at some instincts being apparently not perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many instincts causing other animals to suffer. if species be only well-marked and permanent varieties, we can at once see why their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws in their degrees and kinds of resemblance to their parents,--in being absorbed into each other by successive crosses, and in other such points,--as do the crossed offspring of acknowledged varieties. on the other hand, these would be strange facts if species have been independently created, and varieties have been produced by secondary laws. if we admit that the geological record is imperfect in an extreme degree, then such facts as the record gives, support the theory of descent with modification. new species have come on the stage slowly and at successive intervals; and the amount of change, after equal intervals of time, is widely different in different groups. the extinction of species and of whole groups of species, which has played so conspicuous a part in the history of the organic world, almost inevitably follows on the principle of natural selection; for old forms will be supplanted by new and improved forms. neither single species nor groups of species reappear when the chain of ordinary generation has once been broken. the gradual diffusion of dominant forms, with the slow modification of their descendants, causes the forms of life, after long intervals of time, to appear as if they had changed simultaneously throughout the world. the fact of the fossil remains of each formation being in some degree intermediate in character between the fossils in the formations above and below, is simply explained by their intermediate position in the chain of descent. the grand fact that all extinct organic beings belong to the same system with recent beings, falling either into the same or into intermediate groups, follows from the living and the extinct being the offspring of common parents. as the groups which have descended from an ancient progenitor have generally diverged in character, the progenitor with its early descendants will often be intermediate in character in comparison with its later descendants; and thus we can see why the more ancient a fossil is, the oftener it stands in some degree intermediate between existing and allied groups. recent forms are generally looked at as being, in some vague sense, higher than ancient and extinct forms; and they are in so far higher as the later and more improved forms have conquered the older and less improved organic beings in the struggle for life. lastly, the law of the long endurance of allied forms on the same continent,--of marsupials in australia, of edentata in america, and other such cases,--is intelligible, for within a confined country, the recent and the extinct will naturally be allied by descent. looking to geographical distribution, if we admit that there has been during the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world to another, owing to former climatal and geographical changes and to the many occasional and unknown means of dispersal, then we can understand, on the theory of descent with modification, most of the great leading facts in distribution. we can see why there should be so striking a parallelism in the distribution of organic beings throughout space, and in their geological succession throughout time; for in both cases the beings have been connected by the bond of ordinary generation, and the means of modification have been the same. we see the full meaning of the wonderful fact, which must have struck every traveller, namely, that on the same continent, under the most diverse conditions, under heat and cold, on mountain and lowland, on deserts and marshes, most of the inhabitants within each great class are plainly related; for they will generally be descendants of the same progenitors and early colonists. on this same principle of former migration, combined in most cases with modification, we can understand, by the aid of the glacial period, the identity of some few plants, and the close alliance of many others, on the most distant mountains, under the most different climates; and likewise the close alliance of some of the inhabitants of the sea in the northern and southern temperate zones, though separated by the whole intertropical ocean. although two areas may present the same physical conditions of life, we need feel no surprise at their inhabitants being widely different, if they have been for a long period completely separated from each other; for as the relation of organism to organism is the most important of all relations, and as the two areas will have received colonists from some third source or from each other, at various periods and in different proportions, the course of modification in the two areas will inevitably be different. on this view of migration, with subsequent modification, we can see why oceanic islands should be inhabited by few species, but of these, that many should be peculiar. we can clearly see why those animals which cannot cross wide spaces of ocean, as frogs and terrestrial mammals, should not inhabit oceanic islands; and why, on the other hand, new and peculiar species of bats, which can traverse the ocean, should so often be found on islands far distant from any continent. such facts as the presence of peculiar species of bats, and the absence of all other mammals, on oceanic islands, are utterly inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of creation. the existence of closely allied or representative species in any two areas, implies, on the theory of descent with modification, that the same parents formerly inhabited both areas; and we almost invariably find that wherever many closely allied species inhabit two areas, some identical species common to both still exist. wherever many closely allied yet distinct species occur, many doubtful forms and varieties of the same species likewise occur. it is a rule of high generality that the inhabitants of each area are related to the inhabitants of the nearest source whence immigrants might have been derived. we see this in nearly all the plants and animals of the galapagos archipelago, of juan fernandez, and of the other american islands being related in the most striking manner to the plants and animals of the neighbouring american mainland; and those of the cape de verde archipelago and other african islands to the african mainland. it must be admitted that these facts receive no explanation on the theory of creation. the fact, as we have seen, that all past and present organic beings constitute one grand natural system, with group subordinate to group, and with extinct groups often falling in between recent groups, is intelligible on the theory of natural selection with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of character. on these same principles we see how it is, that the mutual affinities of the species and genera within each class are so complex and circuitous. we see why certain characters are far more serviceable than others for classification;--why adaptive characters, though of paramount importance to the being, are of hardly any importance in classification; why characters derived from rudimentary parts, though of no service to the being, are often of high classificatory value; and why embryological characters are the most valuable of all. the real affinities of all organic beings are due to inheritance or community of descent. the natural system is a genealogical arrangement, in which we have to discover the lines of descent by the most permanent characters, however slight their vital importance may be. the framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse,--the same number of vertebrae forming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephant,--and innumerable other such facts, at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications. the similarity of pattern in the wing and leg of a bat, though used for such different purpose,--in the jaws and legs of a crab,--in the petals, stamens, and pistils of a flower, is likewise intelligible on the view of the gradual modification of parts or organs, which were alike in the early progenitor of each class. on the principle of successive variations not always supervening at an early age, and being inherited at a corresponding not early period of life, we can clearly see why the embryos of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes should be so closely alike, and should be so unlike the adult forms. we may cease marvelling at the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird having branchial slits and arteries running in loops, like those in a fish which has to breathe the air dissolved in water, by the aid of well-developed branchiae. disuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often tend to reduce an organ, when it has become useless by changed habits or under changed conditions of life; and we can clearly understand on this view the meaning of rudimentary organs. but disuse and selection will generally act on each creature, when it has come to maturity and has to play its full part in the struggle for existence, and will thus have little power of acting on an organ during early life; hence the organ will not be much reduced or rendered rudimentary at this early age. the calf, for instance, has inherited teeth, which never cut through the gums of the upper jaw, from an early progenitor having well-developed teeth; and we may believe, that the teeth in the mature animal were reduced, during successive generations, by disuse or by the tongue and palate having been fitted by natural selection to browse without their aid; whereas in the calf, the teeth have been left untouched by selection or disuse, and on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages have been inherited from a remote period to the present day. on the view of each organic being and each separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable it is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we wilfully will not understand. i have now recapitulated the chief facts and considerations which have thoroughly convinced me that species have changed, and are still slowly changing by the preservation and accumulation of successive slight favourable variations. why, it may be asked, have all the most eminent living naturalists and geologists rejected this view of the mutability of species? it cannot be asserted that organic beings in a state of nature are subject to no variation; it cannot be proved that the amount of variation in the course of long ages is a limited quantity; no clear distinction has been, or can be, drawn between species and well-marked varieties. it cannot be maintained that species when intercrossed are invariably sterile, and varieties invariably fertile; or that sterility is a special endowment and sign of creation. the belief that species were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was thought to be of short duration; and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are too apt to assume, without proof, that the geological record is so perfect that it would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species, if they had undergone mutation. but the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate steps. the difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been formed, and great valleys excavated, by the slow action of the coast-waves. the mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations, accumulated during an almost infinite number of generations. although i am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this volume under the form of an abstract, i by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view directly opposite to mine. it is so easy to hide our ignorance under such expressions as the "plan of creation," "unity of design," etc., and to think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact. any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory. a few naturalists, endowed with much flexibility of mind, and who have already begun to doubt on the immutability of species, may be influenced by this volume; but i look with confidence to the future, to young and rising naturalists, who will be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality. whoever is led to believe that species are mutable will do good service by conscientiously expressing his conviction; for only thus can the load of prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed. several eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that a multitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species; but that other species are real, that is, have been independently created. this seems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at. they admit that a multitude of forms, which till lately they themselves thought were special creations, and which are still thus looked at by the majority of naturalists, and which consequently have every external characteristic feature of true species,--they admit that these have been produced by variation, but they refuse to extend the same view to other and very slightly different forms. nevertheless they do not pretend that they can define, or even conjecture, which are the created forms of life, and which are those produced by secondary laws. they admit variation as a vera causa in one case, they arbitrarily reject it in another, without assigning any distinction in the two cases. the day will come when this will be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived opinion. these authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of creation than at an ordinary birth. but do they really believe that at innumerable periods in the earth's history certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues? do they believe that at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were produced? were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed, or as full grown? and in the case of mammals, were they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the mother's womb? although naturalists very properly demand a full explanation of every difficulty from those who believe in the mutability of species, on their own side they ignore the whole subject of the first appearance of species in what they consider reverent silence. it may be asked how far i extend the doctrine of the modification of species. the question is difficult to answer, because the more distinct the forms are which we may consider, by so much the arguments fall away in force. but some arguments of the greatest weight extend very far. all the members of whole classes can be connected together by chains of affinities, and all can be classified on the same principle, in groups subordinate to groups. fossil remains sometimes tend to fill up very wide intervals between existing orders. organs in a rudimentary condition plainly show that an early progenitor had the organ in a fully developed state; and this in some instances necessarily implies an enormous amount of modification in the descendants. throughout whole classes various structures are formed on the same pattern, and at an embryonic age the species closely resemble each other. therefore i cannot doubt that the theory of descent with modification embraces all the members of the same class. i believe that animals have descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number. analogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all animals and plants have descended from some one prototype. but analogy may be a deceitful guide. nevertheless all living things have much in common, in their chemical composition, their germinal vesicles, their cellular structure, and their laws of growth and reproduction. we see this even in so trifling a circumstance as that the same poison often similarly affects plants and animals; or that the poison secreted by the gall-fly produces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak-tree. therefore i should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed. when the views entertained in this volume on the origin of species, or when analogous views are generally admitted, we can dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural history. systematists will be able to pursue their labours as at present; but they will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt whether this or that form be in essence a species. this i feel sure, and i speak after experience, will be no slight relief. the endless disputes whether or not some fifty species of british brambles are true species will cease. systematists will have only to decide (not that this will be easy) whether any form be sufficiently constant and distinct from other forms, to be capable of definition; and if definable, whether the differences be sufficiently important to deserve a specific name. this latter point will become a far more essential consideration than it is at present; for differences, however slight, between any two forms, if not blended by intermediate gradations, are looked at by most naturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the rank of species. hereafter we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only distinction between species and well-marked varieties is, that the latter are known, or believed, to be connected at the present day by intermediate gradations, whereas species were formerly thus connected. hence, without quite rejecting the consideration of the present existence of intermediate gradations between any two forms, we shall be led to weigh more carefully and to value higher the actual amount of difference between them. it is quite possible that forms now generally acknowledged to be merely varieties may hereafter be thought worthy of specific names, as with the primrose and cowslip; and in this case scientific and common language will come into accordance. in short, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those naturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial combinations made for convenience. this may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species. the other and more general departments of natural history will rise greatly in interest. the terms used by naturalists of affinity, relationship, community of type, paternity, morphology, adaptive characters, rudimentary and aborted organs, etc., will cease to be metaphorical, and will have a plain signification. when we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a history; when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, nearly in the same way as when we look at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, i speak from experience, will the study of natural history become! a grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened, on the causes and laws of variation, on correlation of growth, on the effects of use and disuse, on the direct action of external conditions, and so forth. the study of domestic productions will rise immensely in value. a new variety raised by man will be a far more important and interesting subject for study than one more species added to the infinitude of already recorded species. our classifications will come to be, as far as they can be so made, genealogies; and will then truly give what may be called the plan of creation. the rules for classifying will no doubt become simpler when we have a definite object in view. we possess no pedigrees or armorial bearings; and we have to discover and trace the many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies, by characters of any kind which have long been inherited. rudimentary organs will speak infallibly with respect to the nature of long-lost structures. species and groups of species, which are called aberrant, and which may fancifully be called living fossils, will aid us in forming a picture of the ancient forms of life. embryology will reveal to us the structure, in some degree obscured, of the prototypes of each great class. when we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species, and all the closely allied species of most genera, have within a not very remote period descended from one parent, and have migrated from some one birthplace; and when we better know the many means of migration, then, by the light which geology now throws, and will continue to throw, on former changes of climate and of the level of the land, we shall surely be enabled to trace in an admirable manner the former migrations of the inhabitants of the whole world. even at present, by comparing the differences of the inhabitants of the sea on the opposite sides of a continent, and the nature of the various inhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent means of immigration, some light can be thrown on ancient geography. the noble science of geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record. the crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made at hazard and at rare intervals. the accumulation of each great fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on an unusual concurrence of circumstances, and the blank intervals between the successive stages as having been of vast duration. but we shall be able to gauge with some security the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeding organic forms. we must be cautious in attempting to correlate as strictly contemporaneous two formations, which include few identical species, by the general succession of their forms of life. as species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes, and not by miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes; and as the most important of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions, namely, the mutual relation of organism to organism,--the improvement of one being entailing the improvement or the extermination of others; it follows, that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive formations probably serves as a fair measure of the lapse of actual time. a number of species, however, keeping in a body might remain for a long period unchanged, whilst within this same period, several of these species, by migrating into new countries and coming into competition with foreign associates, might become modified; so that we must not overrate the accuracy of organic change as a measure of time. during early periods of the earth's history, when the forms of life were probably fewer and simpler, the rate of change was probably slower; and at the first dawn of life, when very few forms of the simplest structure existed, the rate of change may have been slow in an extreme degree. the whole history of the world, as at present known, although of a length quite incomprehensible by us, will hereafter be recognised as a mere fragment of time, compared with the ages which have elapsed since the first creature, the progenitor of innumerable extinct and living descendants, was created. in the distant future i see open fields for far more important researches. psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history. authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has been independently created. to my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the creator, that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual. when i view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the silurian system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. judging from the past, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity. and of the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species of each genus, and all the species of many genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. we can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretel that it will be the common and widely-spread species, belonging to the larger and dominant groups, which will ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species. as all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the silurian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. and as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection. it is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us. these laws, taken in the largest sense, being growth with reproduction; inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; variability from the indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a ratio of increase so high as to lead to a struggle for life, and as a consequence to natural selection, entailing divergence of character and the extinction of less-improved forms. thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. there is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved. index. aberrant groups, 429. abyssinia, plants of, 375. acclimatisation, 139. affinities: of extinct species, 329. of organic beings, 411. agassiz: on

it includes graphic descriptions of the various emotions, and is admirably illustrated. it is generally admitted that his service consists chiefly in having shown the intimate relation which exists between the movements of expression and those of respiration. one of the most important points, small as it may at first appear, is that the muscles round the eyes are involuntarily contracted during violent expiratory efforts, in order to protect these delicate organs from the pressure of the blood. this fact, which has been fully investigated for me with the greatest kindness by professors donders of utrecht, throws, as we shall hereafter see, a flood of light on several of the most important expressions of the human countenance. the merits of sir c. bell's work have been undervalued or quite ignored by several foreign writers, but have been fully admitted by some, for instance by m. lemoine,[5] who with great justice says:--"le livre de ch. bell devrait etre medite par quiconque essaye de faire parler le visage de l'homme, par les philosophes aussi bien que par les artistes, car, sous une apparence plus legere et sous le pretexte de l'esthetique, c'est un des plus beaux monuments de la science des rapports du physique et du moral." from reasons which will presently be assigned, sir c. bell did not attempt to follow out his views as far as they might have been carried. he does not try to explain why different muscles are brought into action under different emotions; why, for instance, the inner ends of the eyebrows are raised, and the corners of the mouth depressed, by a person suffering from grief or anxiety. in 1807 m. moreau edited an edition of lavater on physiognomy,[6] in which he incorporated several of his own essays, containing excellent descriptions of the movements of the facial muscles, together with many valuable remarks. he throws, however, very little light on the philosophy of the subject. for instance, m. moreau, in speaking of the act of frowning, that is, of the contraction of the muscle called by french writers the _soucilier_ (_corrigator supercilii_), remarks with truth:--"cette action des sourciliers est un des symptomes les plus tranches de l'expression des affections penibles ou concentrees." he then adds that these muscles, from their attachment and position, are fitted "a resserrer, a concentrer les principaux traits de la _face_, comme il convient dans toutes ces passions vraiment oppressives ou profondes, dans ces affections dont le sentiment semble porter l'organisation a revenir sur elle-meme, a se contracter et a _s'amoindrir_, comme pour offrir moins de prise et de surface a des impressions redoutables ou importunes." he who thinks that remarks of this kind throw any light on the meaning or origin of the different expressions, takes a very different view of the subject to what i do. the earliest edition of this work, referred to in the preface to the edition of 1820 in ten volumes, as containing the observations of m. moreau, is said to have been published in 1807; and i have no doubt that this is correct, because the 'notice sur lavater' at the commencement of volume i. is dated april 13, 1806. in some bibliographical works, however, the date of 1805--1809 is given, but it seems impossible that 1805 can be correct. dr. duchenne remarks ('mecanisme de la physionomie humaine,'-8vo edit. 1862, p. 5, and 'archives generales de medecine,' jan. et fev. 1862) that m. moreau "_a compose pour son ouvrage un article important_," &c., in the year 1805; and i find in volume i. of the edition of 1820 passages bearing the dates of december 12, 1805, and another january 5, 1806, besides that of april 13, 1806, above referred to. in consequence of some of these passages having thus been composed in 1805, dr. duchenne assigns to m. moreau the priority over sir c. bell, whose work, as we have seen, was published in 1806. this is a very unusual manner of determining the priority of scientific works; but such questions are of extremely little importance in comparison with their relative merits. the passages above quoted from m. moreau and from le brun are taken in this and all other cases from the edition of 1820 of lavater, tom. iv. p. 228, and tom. ix. p. 279. in the above passage there is but a slight, if any, advance in the philosophy of the subject, beyond that reached by the painter le brun, who, in 1667, in describing the expression of fright, says:--"le sourcil qui est abaisse d'un cote et eleve de l'autre, fait voir que la partie elevee semble le vouloir joindre au cerveau pour le garantir du mal que l'ame apercoit, et le cote qui est abaisse et qui parait enfle,--nous fait trouver dans cet etat par les esprits qui viennent du cerveau en abondance, comme polir couvrir l'aine et la defendre du mal qu'elle craint; la bouche fort ouverte fait voir le saisissement du coeur, par le sang qui se retire vers lui, ce qui l'oblige, voulant respirer, a faire un effort qui est cause que la bouche s'ouvre extremement, et qui, lorsqu'il passe par les organes de la voix, forme un son qui n'est point articule; que si les muscles et les veines paraissent enfles, ce n'est que par les esprits que le cerveau envoie en ces parties-la." i have thought the foregoing sentences worth quoting, as specimens of the surprising nonsense which has been written on the subject. 'the physiology or mechanism of blushing,' by dr. burgess, appeared in 1839, and to this work i shall frequently refer in my thirteenth chapter. in 1862 dr. duchenne published two editions, in folio and octavo, of his 'mecanisme de la physionomie humaine,' in which he analyses by means of electricity, and illustrates by magnificent photographs, the movements of the facial muscles. he has generously permitted me to copy as many of his photographs as i desired. his works have been spoken lightly of, or quite passed over, by some of his countrymen. it is possible that dr. duchenne may have exaggerated the importance of the contraction of single muscles in giving expression; for, owing to the intimate manner in which the muscles are connected, as may be seen in henle's anatomical drawings[7]--the best i believe ever published it is difficult to believe in their separate action. nevertheless, it is manifest that dr. duchenne clearly apprehended this and other sources of error, and as it is known that he was eminently successful in elucidating the physiology of the muscles of the hand by the aid of electricity, it is probable that he is generally in the right about the muscles of the face. in my opinion, dr. duchenne has greatly advanced the subject by his treatment of it. no one has more carefully studied the contraction of each separate muscle, and the consequent furrows produced on the skin. he has also, and this is a very important service, shown which muscles are least under the separate control of the will. he enters very little into theoretical considerations, and seldom attempts to explain why certain muscles and not others contract under the influence of certain emotions. a distinguished french anatomist, pierre gratiolet, gave a course of lectures on expression at the sorbonne, and his notes were published (1865) after his death, under the title of 'de la physionomie et des mouvements d'expression.' this is a very interesting work, full of valuable observations. his theory is rather complex, and, as far as it can be given in a single sentence (p. 65), is as follows:--"il resulte, de tous les faits que j'ai rappeles, que les sens, l'imagination et la pensee ellememe, si elevee, si abstraite qu'on la suppose, ne peuvent s'exercer sans eveiller un sentiment correlatif, et que ce sentiment se traduit directement, sympathiquement, symboliquement ou metaphoriquement, dans toutes les spheres des organs exterieurs, qui la racontent tous, suivant leur mode d'action propre, comme si chacun d'eux avait ete directement affecte." gratiolet appears to overlook inherited habit, and even to some extent habit in the individual; and therefore he fails, as it seems to me, to give the right explanation, or any explanation at all, of many gestures and expressions. as an illustration of what he calls symbolic movements, i will quote his remarks (p. 37), taken from m. chevreul, on a man playing at billiards. "si une bille devie legerement de la direction que le joueur pretend zlui imprimer, ne l'avez-vous pas vu cent fois la pousser du regard, de la tete et meme des epaules, comme si ces mouvements, purement symboliques, pouvaient rectifier son trajet? des mouvements non moins significatifs se produisent quand la bille manque d'une impulsion suffisante. et cliez les joueurs novices, ils sont quelquefois accuses au point d'eveiller le sourire sur les levres des spectateurs." such movements, as it appeirs to me, may be attributed simply to habit. as often as a man has wished to move an object to one side, he has always pushed it to that side when forwards, he has pushed it forwards; and if he has wished to arrest it, he has pulled backwards. therefore, when a man sees his ball travelling in a wrong direction, and he intensely wishes it to go in another direction, he cannot avoid, from long habit, unconsciously performing movements which in other cases he has found effectual. as an instance of sympathetic movements gratiolet gives (p. 212) the following case:--"un jeune chien a oreilles droites, auquel son maitre presente de loin quelque viande appetissante, fixe avec ardeur ses yeux sur cet objet dont il suit tous les mouvements, et pendant que les yeux regardent, les deux oreilles se portent en avant comme si cet objet pouvait etre entendu." here, instead of speaking of sympathy between the ears and eyes, it appears to me more simple to believe, that as dogs during many generations have, whilst intently looking at any object, pricked their ears in order to perceive any sound; and conversely have looked intently in the direction of a sound to which they may have listened, the movements of these organs have become firmly associated together through long-continued habit. dr. piderit published in 1859 an essay on expression, which i have not seen, but in which, as he states, he forestalled gratiolet in many of his views. in 1867 he published his 'wissenschaftliches system der mimik und physiognomik.' it is hardly possible to give in a few sentences a fair notion of his views; perhaps the two following sentences will tell as much as can be briefly told: "the muscular movements of expression are in part related to imaginary objects, and in part to imaginary sensorial impressions. in this proposition lies the key to the comprehension of all expressive muscular movements." (s. 25) again, "expressive movements manifest themselves chiefly in the numerous and mobile muscles of the face, partly because the nerves by which they are set into motion originate in the most immediate vicinity of the mind-organ, but partly also because these muscles serve to support the organs of sense." (s. 26.) if dr. piderit had studied sir c. bell's work, he would probably not have said (s. 101) that violent laughter causes a frown from partaking of the nature of pain; or that with infants (s. 103) the tears irritate the eyes, and thus excite the contraction of the surrounding in muscles. many good remarks are scattered throughout this volume, to which i shall hereafter refer. short discussions on expression may be found in various works, which need not here be particularised. mr. bain, however, in two of his works has treated the subject at some length. he says,[8] "i look upon the expression so-called as part and parcel of the feeling. i believe it to be a general law of the mind that along with the fact of inward feeling or consciousness, there is a diffusive action or excitement over the bodily members." in another place he adds, "a very considerable number of the facts may be brought under the following principle: namely, that states of pleasure are connected with an increase, and states of pain with an abatement, of some, or all, of the vital functions." but the above law of the diffusive action of feelings seems too general to throw much light on special expressions. mr. herbert spencer, in treating of the feelings in his 'principles of psychology' (1855), makes the following remarks:--"fear, when strong, expresses itself in cries, in efforts to hide or escape, in palpitations and tremblings; and these are just the manifestations that would accompany an actual experience of the evil feared. the destructive passions are shown in a general tension of the muscular system, in gnashing of the teeth and protrusion of the claws, in dilated eyes and nostrils in growls; and these are weaker forms of the actions that accompany the killing of prey." here we have, as i believe, the true theory of a large number of expressions; but the chief interest and difficulty of the subject lies in following out the wonderfully complex results. i infer that some one (but who he is i have not been able to ascertain) formerly advanced a nearly similar view, for sir c. bell says,[9] "it has been maintained that what are called the external signs of passion, are only the concomitants of those voluntary movements which the structure renders necessary." mr. spencer has also published[10] a valuable essay on the physiology of laughter, in which he insists on "the general law that feeling passing a certain pitch, habitually vents itself in bodily action," and that "an overflow of nerve-force undirected by any motive, will manifestly take first the most habitual routes; and if these do not suffice, will next overflow into the less habitual ones." this law i believe to be of the highest importance in throwing light on our subject.' all the authors who have written on expression, with the exception of mr. spencer--the great expounder of the principle of evolution--appear to have been firmly convinced that species, man of course included, came into existence in their present condition. sir c. bell, being thus convinced, maintains that many of our facial muscles are "purely instrumental in expression;" or are "a special provision" for this sole object.[12] but the simple fact that the anthropoid apes possess the same facial muscles as we do,[13] renders it very improbable that these muscles in our case serve exclusively for expression; for no one, i presume, would be inclined to admit that monkeys have been endowed with special muscles solely for exhibiting their hideous grimaces. distinct uses, independently of expression, can indeed be assigned with much probability for almost all the facial muscles. sir c. bell evidently wished to draw as broad a distinction as possible between man and the lower animals; and he consequently asserts that with "the lower creatures there is no expression but what may be referred, more or less plainly, to their acts of volition or necessary instincts." he further maintains that their faces "seem chiefly capable of expressing rage and fear."[14] but man himself cannot express love and humility by external signs, so plainly as does a dog, when with drooping ears, hanging lips, flexuous body, and wagging tail, he meets his beloved master. nor can these movements in the dog be explained by acts of volition or necessary instincts, any more than the beaming eyes and smiling cheeks of a man when he meets an old friend. if sir c. bell had been questioned about the expression of affection in the dog, he would no doubt have answered that this animal had been created with special instincts, adapting him for association with man, and that all further enquiry on the subject was superfluous. although gratiolet emphatically denies[15] that any muscle has been developed solely for the sake of expression, he seems never to have reflected on the principle of evolution. he apparently looks at each species as a separate creation. so it is with the other writers on expression. for instance, dr. duchenne, after speaking of the movements of the limbs, refers to those which give expression to the face, and remarks:[16] "le createur n'a donc pas eu a se preoccuper ici des besoins de la mecanique; il a pu, selon sa sagesse, ou--que l'on me pardonne cette maniere de parler--par une divine fantaisie, mettre en action tel ou tel muscle, un seul ou plusieurs muscles a la fois, lorsqu'il a voulu que les signes caracteristiques des passions, meme les plus fugaces, lussent ecrits passagerement sur la face de l'homme. ce langage de la physionomie une fois cree, il lui a suffi, pour le rendre universel et immuable, de donner a tout etre humain la faculte instinctive d'exprimer toujours ses sendments par la contraction des memes muscles." many writers consider the whole subject of expression as inexplicable. thus the illustrious physiologist muller, says,[17] "the completely different expression of the features in different passions shows that, according to the kind of feeling excited, entirely different groups of the fibres of the facial nerve are acted on. of the cause of this we are quite ignorant." no doubt as long as man and all other animals are viewed as independent creations, an effectual stop is put to our natural desire to investigate as far as possible the causes of expression. by this doctrine, anything and everything can be equally well explained; and it has proved as pernicious with respect to expression as to every other branch of natural history. with mankind some expressions, such as the bristling of the hair under the influence of extreme terror, or the uncovering of the teeth under that of furious rage, can hardly be understood, except on the belief that man once existed in a much lower and animal-like condition. the community of certain expressions in distinct though allied species, as in the movements of the same facial muscles during laughter by man and by various monkeys, is rendered somewhat more intelligible, if we believe in their descent from a common progenitor. he who admits on general grounds that the structure and habits of all animals have been gradually evolved, will look at the whole subject of expression in a new and interesting light. the study of expression is difficult, owing to the movements being often extremely slight, and of a fleeting nature. a difference may be clearly perceived, and yet it may be impossible, at least i have found it so, to state in what the difference consists. when we witness any deep emotion, our sympathy is so strongly excited, that close observation is forgotten or rendered almost impossible; of which fact i have had many curious proofs. our imagination is another and still more serious source of error; for if from the nature of the circumstances we expect to see any expression, we readily imagine its presence. notwithstanding dr. duchenne's great experience, he for a long time fancied, as he states, that several muscles contracted under certain emotions, whereas he ultimately convinced himself that the movement was confined to a single muscle. in order to acquire as good a foundation as possible, and to ascertain, independently of common opinion, how far particular movements of the features and gestures are really expressive of certain states of the mind, i have found the following means the most serviceable. in the first place, to observe infants; for they exhibit many emotions, as sir c. bell remarks, "with extraordinary force;" whereas, in after life, some of our expressions "cease to have the pure and simple source from which they spring in infancy."[18] in the second place, it occurred to me that the insane ought to be studied, as they are liable to the strongest passions, and give uncontrolled vent to them. i had, myself, no opportunity of doing this, so i applied to dr. maudsley and received from him an introduction to dr. j. crichton browne, who has charge of an immense asylum near wakefield, and who, as i found, had already attended to the subject. this excellent observer has with unwearied kindness sent me copious notes and descriptions, with valuable suggestions on many points; and i can hardly over-estimate the value of his assistance. i owe also, to the kindness of mr. patrick nicol, of the sussex lunatic asylum, interesting statements on two or three points. thirdly dr. duchenne galvanized, as we have already seen, certain muscles in the face of an old man, whose skin was little sensitive, and thus produced various expressions which were photographed on a large scale. it fortunately occurred to me to show several of the best plates, without a word of explanation, to above twenty educated persons of various ages and both sexes, asking them, in each case, by what emotion or feeling the old man was supposed to be agitated; and i recorded their answers in the words which they used. several of the expressions were instantly recognised by almost everyone, though described in not exactly the same terms; and these may, i think, be relied on as truthful, and will hereafter be specified. on the other hand, the most widely different judgments were pronounced in regard to some of them. this exhibition was of use in another way, by convincing me how easily we may be misguided by our imagination; for when i first looked through dr. duchenne's photographs, reading at the same time the text, and thus learning what was intended, i was struck with admiration at the truthfulness of all, with only a few exceptions. nevertheless, if i had examined them without any explanation, no doubt i should have been as much perplexed, in some cases, as other persons have been. fourthly, i had hoped to derive much aid from the great masters in painting and sculpture, who are such close observers. accordingly, i have looked at photographs and engravings of many well-known works; but, with a few exceptions, have not thus profited. the reason no doubt is, that in works of art, beauty is the chief object; and strongly contracted facial muscles destroy beauty.[19] the story of the composition is generally told with wonderful force and truth by skilfully given accessories. fifthly, it seemed to me highly important to ascertain whether the same expressions and gestures prevail, as has often been asserted without much evidence, with all the races of mankind, especially with those who have associated but little with europeans. whenever the same movements of the features or body express the same emotions in several distinct races of man, we may infer with much probability, that such expressions are true ones,--that is, are innate or instinctive. conventional expressions or gestures, acquired by the individual during early life, would probably have differed in the different races, in the same manner as do their languages. accordingly i circulated, early in the year 1867, the following printed queries with a request, which has been fully responded to, that actual observations, and not memory, might be trusted. these queries were written after a considerable interval of time, during which my attention had been otherwise directed, and i can now see that they might have been greatly improved. to some of the later copies, i appended, in manuscript, a few additional remarks:-- (1.) is astonishment expressed by the eyes and mouth being opened wide, and by the eyebrows being raised? (2.) does shame excite a blush when the colour of the skin allows it to be visible? and especially how low down the body does the blush extend? (3.) when a man is indignant or defiant does he frown, hold his body and head erect, square his shoulders and clench his fists? (4) when considering deeply on any subject, or trying to understand any puzzle, does he frown, or wrinkle the skin beneath the lower eyelids? (5.) when in low spirits, are the corners of the mouth depressed, and the inner corner of the eyebrows raised by that muscle which the french call the "grief muscle"? the eyebrow in this state becomes slightly oblique, with a little swelling at the inner end; and the forehead is transversely wrinkled in the middle part, but not across the whole breadth, as when the eyebrows are raised in surprise. (6.) when in good spirits do the eyes sparkle, with the skin a little wrinkled round and under them, and with the mouth a little drawn back at the corners? (7.) when a man sneers or snarls at another, is the corner of the upper lip over the canine or eye tooth raised on the side facing the man whom he addresses? (8) can a dogged or obstinate expression be recognized, which is chiefly shown by the mouth being firmly closed, a lowering brow and a slight frown? (9.) is contempt expressed by a slight protrusion of the lips and by turning up the nose, and with a slight expiration? (10) is disgust shown by the lower lip being turned down, the upper lip slightly raised, with a sudden expiration, something like incipient vomiting, or like something spit out of the mouth? (11.) is extreme fear expressed in the same general manner as with europeans? (12.) is laughter ever carried to such an extreme as to bring tears into the eyes? (13.) when a man wishes to show that he cannot prevent something being done, or cannot himself do something, does he shrug his shoulders, turn inwards his elbows, extend outwards his hands and open the palms; with the eyebrows raised? (14) do the children when sulky, pout or greatly protrude the lips? (15.) can guilty, or sly, or jealous expressions be recognized? though i know not how these can be defined. (16.) is the head nodded vertically in affirmation, and shaken laterally in negation? observations on natives who have had little communication with europeans would be of course the most valuable, though those made on any natives would be of much interest to me. general remarks on expression are of comparatively little value; and memory is so deceptive that i earnestly beg it may not be trusted. a definite description of the countenance under any emotion or frame of mind, with a statement of the circumstances under which it occurred, would possess much value. to these queries i have received thirty-six answers from different observers, several of them missionaries or protectors of the aborigines, to all of whom i am deeply indebted for the great trouble which they have taken, and for the valuable aid thus received. i will specify their names, &c., towards the close of this chapter, so as not to interrupt my present remarks. the answers relate to several of the most distinct and savage races of man. in many instances, the circumstances have been recorded under which each expression was observed, and the expression itself described. in such cases, much confidence may be placed in the answers. when the answers have been simply yes or no, i have always received them with caution. it follows, from the information thus acquired, that the same state of mind is expressed throughout the world with remarkable uniformity; and this fact is in itself interesting as evidence of the close similarity in bodily structure and mental disposition of all the races, of mankind. sixthly, and lastly, i have attended as closely as i could, to the expression of the several passions in some of the commoner animals; and this i believe to be of paramount importance, not of course for deciding how far in man certain expressions are characteristic of certain states of mind, but as affording the safest basis for generalisation on the causes, or origin, of the various movements of expression. in observing animals, we are not so likely to be biassed by our imagination; and we may feel safe that their expressions are not conventional. from the reasons above assigned, namely, the fleeting nature of some expressions (the changes in the features being often extremely slight); our sympathy being easily aroused when we behold any strong emotion, and our attention thus distracted; our imagination deceiving us, from knowing in a vague manner what to expect, though certainly few of us know what the exact changes in the countenance are; and lastly, even our long familiarity with the subject,--from all these causes combined, the observation of expression is by no means easy, as many persons, whom i have asked to observe certain points, have soon discovered. hence it is difficult to determine, with certainty, what are the movements of the features and of the body, which commonly characterize certain states of the mind. nevertheless, some of the doubts and difficulties have, as i hope, been cleared away by the observation of infants,--of the insane,--of the different races of man,--of works of art,--and lastly, of the facial muscles under the action of galvanism, as effected by dr. duchenne. but there remains the much greater difficulty of understanding the cause or origin of the several expressions, and of judging whether any theoretical explanation is trustworthy. besides, judging as well as we can by our reason, without the aid of any rules, which of two or more explanations is the most satisfactory, or are quite unsatisfactory, i see only one way of testing our conclusions. this is to observe whether the same principle by which one expression can, as it appears, be explained, is applicable in other allied cases; and especially, whether the same general principles can be applied with satisfactory results, both to man and the lower animals. this latter method, i am inclined to think, is the most serviceable of all. the difficulty of judging of the truth of any theoretical explanation, and of testing it by some distinct line of investigation, is the great drawback to that interest which the study seems well fitted to excite. finally, with respect to my own observations, i may state that they were commenced in the year 1838; and from that time to the present day, i have occasionally attended to the subject. at the above date, i was already inclined to believe in the principle of evolution, or of the derivation of species from other and lower forms. consequently, when i read sir c. bell's great work, his view, that man had been created with certain muscles specially adapted for the expression of his feelings, struck me as unsatisfactory. it seemed probable that the habit of expressing our feelings by certain movements, though now rendered innate, had been in some manner gradually acquired. but to discover how such habits had been acquired was perplexing in no small degree. the whole subject had to be viewed under a new aspect, and each expression demanded a rational explanation. this belief led me to attempt the present work, however imperfectly it may have been executed.-------- i will now give the names of the gentlemen to whom, as i have said, i am deeply indebted for information in regard to the expressions exhibited by various races of man, and i will specify some of the circumstances under which the observations were in each case made. owing to the great kindness and powerful influence of mr. wilson, of hayes place, kent, i have received from australia no less than thirteen sets of answers to my queries. this has been particularly fortunate, as the australian aborigines rank amongst the most distinct of all the races of man. it will be seen that the observations have been chiefly made in the south, in the outlying parts of the colony of victoria; but some excellent answers have been received from the north. mr. dyson lacy has given me in detail some valuable observations, made several hundred miles in the interior of queensland. to mr. r. brough smyth, of melbourne, i am much indebted for observations made by himself, and for sending me several of the following letters, namely:--from the rev. mr. hagenauer, of lake wellington, a missionary in gippsland, victoria, who has had much experience with the natives. from mr. samuel wilson, a landowner, residing at langerenong, wimmera, victoria. from the rev. george taplin, superintendent of the native industrial settlement at port macleay. from mr. archibald g. lang, of coranderik, victoria, a teacher at a school where aborigines, old and young, are collected from all parts of the colony. from mr. h. b. lane, of belfast, victoria, a police magistrate and warden, whose observations, as i am assured, are highly trustworthy. from mr. templeton bunnett, of echuca, whose station is on the borders of the colony of victoria, and who has thus been able to observe many aborigines who have had little intercourse with white men. he compared his observations with those made by two other gentlemen long resident in the neighbourhood. also from mr. j. bulmer, a missionary in a remote part of gippsland, victoria. i am also indebted to the distinguished botanist, dr. ferdinand muller, of victoria, for some observations made by himself, and for sending me others made by mrs. green, as well as for some of the foregoing letters. in regard to the maoris of new zealand, the rev. j. w. stack has answered only a few of my queries; but the answers have been remarkably full, clear, and distinct, with the circumstances recorded under which the observations were made. the rajah brooke has given me some information with respect to the dyaks of borneo. respecting the malays, i have been highly successful; for mr. f. geach (to whom i was introduced by mr. wallace), during his residence as a mining engineer in the interior of malacca, observed many natives, who had never before associated with white men. he wrote me two long letters with admirable and detailed observations on their expression. he likewise observed the chinese immigrants in the malay archipelago. the well-known naturalist, h. m. consul, mr. swinhoe, also observed for me the chinese in their native country; and he made inquiries from others whom he could trust. in india mr. h. erskine, whilst residing in his official capacity in the admednugur district in the bombay presidency, attended to the expression of the inhabitants, but found much difficulty in arriving at any safe conclusions, owing to their habitual concealment of all emotions in the presence of europeans. he also obtained information for me from mr. west, the judge in canara, and he consulted some intelligent native gentlemen on certain points. in calcutta mr. j. scott, curator of the botanic gardens, carefully observed the various tribes of men therein employed during a considerable period, and no one has sent me such full and valuable details. the habit of accurate observation, gained by his botanical studies, has been brought to bear on our present subject. for ceylon i am much indebted to the rev. s. o. glenie for answers to some of my queries. turning to africa, i have been unfortunate with respect to the negroes, though mr. winwood reade aided me as far as lay in his power. it would have been comparatively easy to have obtained information in regard to the negro slaves in america; but as they have long associated with white men, such observations would have possessed little value. in the southern parts of the continent mrs. barber observed the kafirs and fingoes, and sent me many distinct answers. mr. j. p. mansel weale also made some observations on the natives, and procured for me a curious document, namely, the opinion, written in english, of christian gaika, brother of the chief sandilli, on the expressions of his fellow-countrymen. in the northern regions of africa captain speedy, who long resided with the abyssinians, answered my queries partly from memory and partly from observations made on the son of king theodore, who was then under his charge. professor and mrs. asa gray attended to some points in the expressions of the natives, as observed by them whilst ascending the nile. on the great american continent mr. bridges, a catechist residing with the fuegians, answered some few questions about their expression, addressed to him many years ago. in the northern half of the continent dr. rothrock attended to the expressions of the wild atnah and espyox tribes on the nasse river, in north-western america. mr. washington matthews assistant-surgeon in the united states army, also observed with special care (after having seen my queries, as printed in the 'smithsonian report') some of the wildest tribes in the western parts of the united states, namely, the tetons, grosventres, mandans, and assinaboines; and his answers have proved of the highest value. lastly, besides these special sources of information, i have collected some few facts incidentally given in books of travels.---- [illustration: muscles of the human face. fig 1-2] [illustration: muscles of the human face. fig 3] as i shall often have to refer, more especially in the latter part of this volume, to the muscles of the human face, i have had a diagram (fig. 1) copied and reduced from sir c. bell's work, and two others, with more accurate details (figs. 2 and 3), from herde's well-known 'handbuch der systematischen anatomie des menschen.' the same letters refer to the same muscles in all three figures, but the names are given of only the more important ones to which i shall have to allude. the facial muscles blend much together, and, as i am informed, hardly appear on a dissected face so distinct as they are here represented. some writers consider that these muscles consist of nineteen pairs, with one unpaired;[20] but others make the number much larger, amounting even to fifty-five, according to moreau. they are, as is admitted by everyone who has written on the subject, very variable in structure; and moreau remarks that they are hardly alike in half-a-dozen subjects.[21] they are also variable in function. thus the power of uncovering the canine tooth on one side differs much in different persons. the power of raising the wings of the nostrils is also, according to dr. piderit,[22] variable in a remarkable degree; and other such cases could be given. finally, i must have the pleasure of expressing my obligations to mr. rejlander for the trouble which he has taken in photographing for me various expressions and gestures. i am also indebted to herr kindermann, of hamburg, for the loan of some excellent negatives of crying infants; and to dr. wallich for a charming one of a smiling girl. i have already expressed my obligations to dr. duchenne for generously permitting me to have some of his large photographs copied and reduced. all these photographs have been printed by the heliotype process, and the accuracy of the copy is thus guaranteed. these plates are referred to by roman numerals. i am also greatly indebted to mr. t. w. wood for the extreme pains which he has taken in drawing from life the expressions of various animals. a distinguished artist, mr. riviere, has had the kindness to give me two drawings of dogs--one in a hostile and the other in a humble and caressing frame of mind. mr. a. may has also given me two similar sketches of dogs. mr. cooper has taken much care in cutting the blocks. some of the photographs and drawings, namely, those by mr. may, and those by mr. wolf of the cynopithecus, were first reproduced by mr. cooper on wood by means of photography, and then engraved: by this means almost complete fidelity is ensured. chapter i. -- general principles of expression. the three chief principles stated--the first principle--serviceable actions become habitual in association with certain states of the mind, and are performed whether or not of service in each particular case--the force of habit--inheritance--associated habitual movements in man--reflex actions--passage of habits into reflex actions--associated habitual movements in the lower animals--concluding remarks. i will begin by giving the three principles, which appear to me to account for most of the expressions and gestures involuntarily used by man and the lower animals, under the influence of various emotions and sensations.[101] i arrived, however, at these three principles only at the close of my observations. they will be discussed in the present and two following chapters in a general manner. facts observed both with man and the lower animals will here be made use of; but the latter facts are preferable, as less likely to deceive us. in the fourth and fifth chapters, i will describe the special expressions of some of the lower animals; and in the succeeding chapters those of man. everyone will thus be able to judge for himself, how far my three principles throw light on the theory of the subject. it appears to me that so many expressions are thus explained in a fairly satisfactory manner, that probably all will hereafter be found to come under the same or closely analogous heads. i need hardly premise that movements or changes in any part of the body,--as the wagging of a dog's tail, the drawing back of a horse's ears, the shrugging of a man's shoulders, or the dilatation of the capillary vessels of the skin,--may all equally well serve for expression. the three principles are as follows. i. _the principle of serviceable associated habits_.--certain complex actions are of direct or indirect service under certain states of the mind, in order to relieve or gratify certain sensations, desires, &c.; and whenever the same state of mind is induced, however feebly, there is a tendency through the force of habit and association for the same movements to be performed, though they may not then be of the least use. some actions ordinarily associated through habit with certain states of the mind may be partially repressed through the will, and in such cases the muscles which are least under the separate control of the will are the most liable still to act, causing movements which we recognize as expressive. in certain other cases the checking of one habitual movement requires other slight movements; and these are likewise expressive. ii. _the principle of antithesis_.--certain states of the mind lead to certain habitual actions, which are of service, as under our first principle. now when a directly opposite state of mind is induced, there is a strong and involuntary tendency to the performance of movements of a directly opposite nature, though these are of no use; and such movements are in some cases highly expressive. iii. _the principle of actions due to the constitution of the nervous system, independently from the first of the will, and independently to a certain extent of habit_.--when the sensorium is strongly excited, nerve-force is generated in excess, and is transmitted in certain definite directions, depending on the connection of the nerve-cells, and partly on habit: or the supply of nerve-force may, as it appears, be interrupted. effects are thus produced which we recognize as expressive. this third principle may, for the sake of brevity, be called that of the direct action of the nervous system. with respect to our _first principle_, it is notorious how powerful is the force of habit. the most complex and difficult movements can in time be performed without the least effort or consciousness. it is not positively known how it comes that habit is so efficient in facilitating complex movements; but physiologists admit[102] "that the conducting power of the nervous fibres increases with the frequency of their excitement." this applies to the nerves of motion and sensation, as well as to those connected with the act of thinking. that some physical change is produced in the nerve-cells or nerves which are habitually used can hardly be doubted, for otherwise it is impossible to understand how the tendency to certain acquired movements is inherited. that they are inherited we see with horses in certain transmitted paces, such as cantering and ambling, which are not natural to them,--in the pointing of young pointers and the setting of young setters--in the peculiar manner of flight of certain breeds of the pigeon, &c. we have analogous cases with mankind in the inheritance of tricks or unusual gestures, to which we shall presently recur. to those who admit the gradual evolution of species, a most striking instance of the perfection with which the most difficult consensual movements can be transmitted, is afforded by the humming-bird sphinx-moth (_macroglossa_); for this moth, shortly after its emergence from the cocoon, as shown by the bloom on its unruffled scales, may be seen poised stationary in the air, with its long hair-like proboscis uncurled and inserted into the minute orifices of flowers; and no one, i believe, has ever seen this moth learning to perform its difficult task, which requires such unerring aim. when there exists an inherited or instinctive tendency to the performance of an action, or an inherited taste for certain kinds of food, some degree of habit in the individual is often or generally requisite. we find this in the paces of the horse, and to a certain extent in the pointing of dogs; although some young dogs point excellently the first time they are taken out, yet they often associate the proper inherited attitude with a wrong odour, and even with eyesight. i have heard it asserted that if a calf be allowed to suck its mother only once, it is much more difficult afterwards to rear it by hand.[103] caterpillars which have been fed on the leaves of one kind of tree, have been known to perish from hunger rather than to eat the leaves of another tree, although this afforded them their proper food, under a state of nature;[104] and so it is in many other cases. the power of association is admitted by everyone. mr. bain remarks, that "actions, sensations and states of feeling, occurring together or in close succession, tend to grow together, or cohere, in such a way that when any one of them is afterwards presented to the mind, the others are apt to be brought up in idea."[105] it is so important for our purpose fully to recognize that actions readily become associated with other actions and with various states of the mind, that i will give a good many instances, in the first place relating to man, and afterwards to the lower animals. some of the instances are of a very trifling nature, but they are as good for our purpose as more important habits. it is known to everyone how difficult, or even impossible it is, without repeated trials, to move the limbs in certain opposed directions which have never been practised. analogous cases occur with sensations, as in the common experiment of rolling a marble beneath the tips of two crossed fingers, when it feels exactly like two marbles. everyone protects himself when falling to the ground by extending his arms, and as professor alison has remarked, few can resist acting thus, when voluntarily falling on a soft bed. a man when going out of doors puts on his gloves quite unconsciously; and this may seem an extremely simple operation, but he who has taught a child to put on gloves, knows that this is by no means the case. when our minds are much affected, so are the movements of our bodies; but here another principle besides habit, namely the undirected overflow of nerve-force, partially comes into play. norfolk, in speaking of cardinal wolsey, says-- "some strange commotion is in his brain; he bites his lip and starts; stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground, then, lays his finger on his temple: straight, springs out into fast gait; then, stops again, strikes his breast hard; and anon, he casts his eye against the moon: in most strange postures we have seen him set himself."--_hen. viii_., act 3, sc. 2. a vulgar man often scratches his head when perplexed in mind; and i believe that he acts thus from habit, as if he experienced a slightly uncomfortable bodily sensation, namely, the itching of his head, to which he is particularly liable, and which he thus relieves. another man rubs his eyes when perplexed, or gives a little cough when embarrassed, acting in either case as if he felt a slightly uncomfortable sensation in his eyes or windpipe.[106] from the continued use of the eyes, these organs are especially liable to be acted on through association under various states of the mind, although there is manifestly nothing to be seen. a man, as gratiolet remarks, who vehemently rejects a proposition, will almost certainly shut his eyes or turn away his face; but if he accepts the proposition, he will nod his head in affirmation and open his eyes widely. the man acts in this latter case as if he clearly saw the thing, and in the former case as if he did not or would not see it. i have noticed that persons in describing a horrid sight often shut their eyes momentarily and firmly, or shake their heads, as if not to see or to drive away something disagreeable; and i have caught myself, when thinking in the dark of a horrid spectacle, closing my eyes firmly. in looking suddenly at any object, or in looking all around, everyone raises his eyebrows, so that the eyes may be quickly and widely opened; and duchenne remarks that[107] a person in trying to remember something often raises his eyebrows, as if to see it. a hindoo gentleman made exactly the same remark to mr. erskine in regard to his countrymen. i noticed a young lady earnestly trying to recollect a painter's name, and she first looked to one corner of the ceiling and then to the opposite corner, arching the one eyebrow on that side; although, of course, there was nothing to be seen there. in most of the foregoing cases, we can understand how the associated movements were acquired through habit; but with some individuals, certain strange gestures or tricks have arisen in association with certain states of the mind, owing to wholly inexplicable causes, and are undoubtedly inherited. i have elsewhere given one instance from my own observation of an extraordinary and complex gesture, associated with pleasurable feelings, which was transmitted from a father to his daughter, as well as some other analogous facts.[108] another curious instance of an odd inherited movement, associated with the wish to obtain an object, will be given in the course of this volume. there are other actions which are commonly performed under certain circumstances, independently of habit, and which seem to be due to imitation or some sort of sympathy. thus persons cutting anything with a pair of scissors may be seen to move their jaws simultaneously with the blades of the scissors. children learning to write often twist about their tongues as their fingers move, in a ridiculous fashion. when a public singer suddenly becomes a little hoarse, many of those present may be heard, as i have been assured by a gentleman on whom i can rely, to clear their throats; but here habit probably comes into play, as we clear our own throats under similar circumstances. i have also been told that at leaping matches, as the performer makes his spring, many of the spectators, generally men and boys, move their feet; but here again habit probably comes into play, for it is very doubtful whether women would thus act. _reflex actions_--reflex actions, in the strict sense of the term, are due to the excitement of a peripheral nerve, which transmits its influence to certain nerve-cells, and these in their turn excite certain muscles or glands into action; and all this may take place without any sensation or consciousness on our part, though often thus accompanied. as many reflex actions are highly expressive, the subject must here be noticed at some little length. we shall also see that some of them graduate into, and can hardly be distinguished from actions which have arisen through habit? coughing and sneezing are familiar instances of reflex actions. with infants the first act of respiration is often a sneeze, although this requires the co-ordinated movement of numerous muscles. respiration is partly voluntary, but mainly reflex, and is performed in the most natural and best manner without the interference of the will. a vast number of complex movements are reflex. as good an instance as can be given is the often-quoted one of a decapitated frog, which cannot of course feel, and cannot consciously perform, any movement. yet if a drop of acid be placed on the lower surface of the thigh of a frog in this state, it will rub off the drop with the upper surface of the foot of the same leg. if this foot be cut off, it cannot thus act. "after some fruitless efforts, therefore, it gives up trying in that way, seems restless, as though, says pfluger, it was seeking some other way, and at last it makes use of the foot of the other leg and succeeds in rubbing off the acid. notably we have here not merely contractions of muscles, but combined and harmonized contractions in due sequence for a special purpose. these are actions that have all the appearance of being guided by intelligence and instigated by will in an animal, the recognized organ of whose intelligence and will has been removed."[110] we see the difference between reflex and voluntary movements in very young children not being able to perform, as i am informed by sir henry holland, certain acts somewhat analogous to those of sneezing and coughing, namely, in their not being able to blow their noses (i. e. to compress the nose and blow violently through the passage), and in their not being able to clear their throats of phlegm. they have to learn to perform these acts, yet they are performed by us, when a little older, almost as easily as reflex actions. sneezing and coughing, however, can be controlled by the will only partially or not at all; whilst the clearing the throat and blowing the nose are completely under our command. when we are conscious of the presence of an irritating particle in our nostrils or windpipe--that is, when the same sensory nerve-cells are excited, as in the case of sneezing and coughing--we can voluntarily expel the particle by forcibly driving air through these passages; but we cannot do this with nearly the same force, rapidity, and precision, as by a reflex action. in this latter case the sensory nerve-cells apparently excite the motor nerve-cells without any waste of power by first communicating with the cerebral hemispheres--the seat of our consciousness and volition. in all cases there seems to exist a profound antagonism between the same movements, as directed by the will and by a reflex stimulant, in the force with which they are performed and in the facility with which they are excited. as claude bernard asserts, "l'influence du cerveau tend donc a entraver les mouvements reflexes, a limiter leur force et leur etendue."[111] the conscious wish to perform a reflex action sometimes stops or interrupts its performance, though the proper sensory nerves may be stimulated. for instance, many years ago i laid a small wager with a dozen young men that they would not sneeze if they took snuff, although they all declared that they invariably did so; accordingly they all took a pinch, but from wishing much to succeed, not one sneezed, though their eyes watered, and all, without exception, had to pay me the wager. sir h. holland remarks[112] that attention paid to the act of swallowing interferes with the proper movements; from which it probably follows, at least in part, that some persons find it so difficult to swallow a pill. another familiar instance of a reflex action is the involuntary closing of the eyelids when the surface of the eye is touched. a similar winking movement is caused when a blow is directed towards the face; but this is an habitual and not a strictly reflex action, as the stimulus is conveyed through the mind and not by the excitement of a peripheral nerve. the whole body and head are generally at the same time drawn suddenly backwards. these latter movements, however, can be prevented, if the danger does not appear to the imagination imminent; but our reason telling us that there is no danger does not suffice. i may mention a trifling fact, illustrating this point, and which at the time amused me. i put my face close to the thick glass-plate in front of a puff-adder in the zoological gardens, with the firm determination of not starting back if the snake struck at me; but, as soon as the blow was struck, my resolution went for nothing, and i jumped a yard or two backwards with astonishing rapidity. my will and reason were powerless against the imagination of a danger which had never been experienced. the violence of a start seems to depend partly on the vividness of the imagination, and partly on the condition, either habitual or temporary, of the nervous system. he who will attend to the starting of his horse, when tired and fresh, will perceive how perfect is the gradation from a mere glance at some unexpected object, with a momentary doubt whether it is dangerous, to a jump so rapid and violent, that the animal probably could not voluntarily whirl round in so rapid a manner. the nervous system of a fresh and highly-fed horse sends its order to the motory system so quickly, that no time is allowed for him to consider whether or not the danger is real. after one violent start, when he is excited and the blood flows freely through his brain, he is very apt to start again; and so it is, as i have noticed, with young infants. a start from a sudden noise, when the stimulus is conveyed through the auditory nerves, is always accompanied in grown-up persons by the winking of the eyelids.[113] i observed, however, that though my infants started at sudden sounds, when under a fortnight old, they certainly did not always wink their eyes, and i believe never did so. the start of an older infant apparently represents a vague catching hold of something to prevent falling. i shook a pasteboard box close before the eyes of one of my infants, when 114 days old, and it did not in the least wink; but when i put a few comfits into the box, holding it in the same position as before, and rattled them, the child blinked its eyes violently every time, and started a little. it was obviously impossible that a carefully-guarded infant could have learnt by experience that a rattling sound near its eyes indicated danger to them. but such experience will have been slowly gained at a later age during a long series of generations; and from what we know of inheritance, there is nothing improbable in the transmission of a habit to the offspring at an earlier age than that at which it was first acquired by the parents. from the foregoing remarks it seems probable that some actions, which were at first performed consciously, have become through habit and association converted into reflex actions, and are now so firmly fixed and inherited, that they are performed, even when not of the least use,[114] as often as the same causes arise, which originally excited them in us through the volition. in such cases the sensory nerve-cells excite the motor cells, without first communicating with those cells on which our consciousness and volition depend. it is probable that sneezing and coughing were originally acquired by the habit of expelling, as violently as possible, any irritating particle from the sensitive air-passages. as far as time is concerned, there has been more than enough for these habits to have become innate or converted into reflex actions; for they are common to most or all of the higher quadrupeds, and must therefore have been first acquired at a very remote period. why the act of clearing the throat is not a reflex action, and has to be learnt by our children, i cannot pretend to say; but we can see why blowing the nose on a handkerchief has to be learnt. it is scarcely credible that the movements of a headless frog, when it wipes off a drop of acid or other object from its thigh, and which movements are so well coordinated for a special purpose, were not at first performed voluntarily, being afterwards rendered easy through long-continued habit so as at last to be performed unconsciously, or independently of the cerebral hemispheres. so again it appears probable that starting was originally acquired by the habit of jumping away as quickly as possible from danger, whenever any of our senses gave us warning. starting, as we have seen, is accompanied by the blinking of the eyelids so as to protect the eyes, the most tender and sensitive organs of the body; and it is, i believe, always accompanied by a sudden and forcible inspiration, which is the natural preparation for any violent effort. but when a man or horse starts, his heart beats wildly against his ribs, and here it may be truly said we have an organ which has never been under the control of the will, partaking in the general reflex movements of the body. to this point, however, i shall return in a future chapter. the contraction of the iris, when the retina is stimulated by a bright light, is another instance of a movement, which it appears cannot possibly have been at first voluntarily performed and then fixed by habit; for the iris is not known to be under the conscious control of the will in any animal. in such cases some explanation, quite distinct from habit, will have to be discovered. the radiation of nerve-force from strongly-excited nerve-cells to other connected cells, as in the case of a bright light on the retina causing a sneeze, may perhaps aid us in understanding how some reflex actions originated. a radiation of nerve-force of this kind, if it caused a movement tending to lessen the primary irritation, as in the case of the contraction of the iris preventing too much light from falling on the retina, might afterwards have been taken advantage of and modified for this special purpose. it further deserves notice that reflex actions are in all probability liable to slight variations, as are all corporeal structures and instincts; and any variations which were beneficial and of sufficient importance, would tend to be preserved and inherited. thus reflex actions, when once gained for one purpose, might afterwards be modified independently of the will or habit, so as to serve for some distinct purpose. such cases would be parallel with those which, as we have every reason to believe, have occurred with many instincts; for although some instincts have been developed simply through long-continued and inherited habit, other highly complex ones have been developed through the preservation of variations of pre-existing instincts--that is, through natural selection. i have discussed at some little length, though as i am well aware, in a very imperfect manner, the acquirement of reflex actions, because they are often brought into play in connection with movements expressive of our emotions; and it was necessary to show that at least some of them might have been erst acquired through the will in order to satisfy a desire, or to relieve a disagreeable sensation. _associated habitual movements in the lower animals_.--i have already given in the case of man several instances of movements associated with various states of the mind or body, which are now purposeless, but which were originally of use, and are still of use under certain circumstances. as this subject is very important for us, i will here give a considerable number of analogous facts, with reference to animals; although many of them are of a very trifling nature. my object is to show that certain movements were originally performed for a definite end, and that, under nearly the same circumstances, they are still pertinaciously performed through habit when not of the least use. that the tendency in most of the following cases is inherited, we may infer from such actions being performed in the same manner by all the individuals, young and old, of he same species. we shall also see that they are excited by the most diversified, often circuitous, and sometimes mistaken associations. dogs, when they wish to go to sleep on a carpet or other hard surface, generally turn round and round and scratch the ground with their fore-paws in a senseless manner, as if they intended to trample down the grass and scoop out a hollow, as no doubt their wild parents did, when they lived on open grassy plains or in the woods. jackals, fennecs, and other allied animals in the zoological gardens, treat their straw in this manner; but it is a rather odd circumstance that the keepers, after observing for some months, have never seen the wolves thus behave. a semi-idiotic dog--and an animal in this condition would be particularly liable to follow a senseless habit--was observed by a friend to turn completely round on a carpet thirteen times before going to sleep. many carnivorous animals, as they crawl towards their prey and prepare to rush or spring on it, lower their heads and crouch, partly, as it would appear, to hide themselves, and partly to get ready for their rush; and this habit in an exaggerated form has become hereditary in our pointers and setters. now i have noticed scores of times that when two strange dogs meet on an open road, the one which first sees the other, though at the distance of one or two hundred yards, after the first glance always lowers its bead, generally crouches a little, or even lies down; that is, he takes the proper attitude for concealing himself and for making a rush or spring although the road is quite open and the distance great. again, dogs of all kinds when intently watching and slowly approaching their prey, frequently keep one of their fore-legs doubled up for a long time, ready for the next cautious step; and this is eminently characteristic of the pointer. but from habit they behave in exactly the same manner whenever their attention is aroused (fig. 4). i have seen a dog at the foot of a high wall, listening attentively to a sound on the opposite side, with one leg doubled up; and in this case there could have been no intention of making a cautious approach. [illustration: small dog watching a cat on a table. figure 4] {illust. caption = for making a rush or fig. 4.--small dog watching a cat on a table. from a photograph taken by mr. rejlander.} dogs after voiding their excrement often make with all four feet a few scratches backwards, even on a bare stone pavement, as if for the purpose of covering up their excrement with earth, in nearly the same manner as do cats. wolves and jackals behave in the zoological gardens in exactly the same manner, yet, as i am assured by the keepers, neither wolves, jackals, nor foxes, when they have the means of doing so, ever cover up their excrement, any more than do dogs. all these animals, however, bury superfluous food. hence, if we rightly understand the meaning of the above cat-like habit, of which there can be little doubt, we have a purposeless remnant of an habitual movement, which was originally followed by some remote progenitor of the dog-genus for a definite purpose, and which has been retained for a prodigious length of time. dogs and jackals[115] take much pleasure in rolling and rubbing their necks and backs on carrion. the odour seems delightful to them, though dogs at least do not eat carrion. mr. bartlett has observed wolves for me, and has given them carrion, but has never seen them roll on it. i have heard it remarked, and i believe it to be true, that the larger dogs, which are probably descended from wolves, do not so often roll in carrion as do smaller dogs, which are probably descended from jackals. when a piece of brown biscuit is offered to a terrier of mine and she is not hungry (and i have heard of similar instances), she first tosses it about and worries it, as if it were a rat or other prey; she then repeatedly rolls on it precisely as if it were a piece of carrion, and at last eats it. it would appear that an imaginary relish has to be given to the distasteful morsel; and to effect this the dog acts in his habitual manner, as if the biscuit was a live animal or smelt like carrion, though he knows better than we do that this is not the case. i have seen this same terrier act in the same manner after killing a little bird or mouse. dogs scratch themselves by a rapid movement of one of their hind-feet; and when their backs are rubbed with a stick, so strong is the habit, that they cannot help rapidly scratching the air or the ground in a useless and ludicrous manner. the terrier just alluded to, when thus scratched with a stick, will sometimes show her delight by another habitual movement, namely, by licking the air as if it were my hand. horses scratch themselves by nibbling those parts of their bodies which they can reach with their teeth; but more commonly one horse shows another where he wants to be scratched, and they then nibble each other. a friend whose attention i had called to the subject, observed that when he rubbed his horse's neck, the animal protruded his head, uncovered his teeth, and moved his jaws, exactly as if nibbling another horse's neck, for he could never have nibbled his own neck. if a horse is much tickled, as when curry-combed, his wish to bite something becomes so intolerably strong, that he will clatter his teeth together, and though not vicious, bite his groom. at the same time from habit he closely depresses his ears, so as to protect them from being bitten, as if he were fighting with another horse. a horse when eager to start on a journey makes the nearest approach which he can to the habitual movement of progression by pawing the ground. now when horses in their stalls are about to be fed and are eager for their corn, they paw the pavement or the straw. two of my horses thus behave when they see or hear the corn given to their neighbours. but here we have what may almost be called a true expression, as pawing the ground is universally recognized as a sign of eagerness. cats cover up their excrements of both kinds with earth; and my grandfather[117]{sic} saw a kitten scraping ashes over a spoonful of pure water spilt on the hearth; so that here an habitual or instinctive action was falsely excited, not by a previous act or by odour, but by eyesight. it is well known that cats dislike wetting their feet, owing, it is probable, to their having aboriginally inhabited the dry country of egypt; and when they wet their feet they shake them violently. my daughter poured some water into a glass close to the head of a kitten; and it immediately shook its feet in the usual manner; so that here we have an habitual movement falsely excited by an associated sound instead of by the sense of touch. kittens, puppies, young pigs and probably many other young animals, alternately push with their forefeet against the mammary glands of their mothers, to excite a freer secretion of milk, or to make it flow. now it is very common with young cats, and not at all rare with old cats of the common and persian breeds (believed by some naturalists to be specifically extinct), when comfortably lying on a warm shawl or other soft substance, to pound it quietly and alternately with their fore-feet; their toes being spread out and claws slightly protruded, precisely as when sucking their mother. that it is the same movement is clearly shown by their often at the same time taking a bit of the shawl into their mouths and sucking it; generally closing their eyes and purring from delight. this curious movement is commonly excited only in association with the sensation of a warm soft surface; but i have seen an old cat, when pleased by having its back scratched, pounding the air with its feet in the same manner; so that this action has almost become the expression of a pleasurable sensation. having referred to the act of sucking, i may add that this complex movement, as well as the alternate protrusion of the fore-feet, are reflex actions; for they are performed if a finger moistened with milk is placed in the mouth of a puppy, the front part of whose brain has been removed.[117] it has recently been stated in france, that the action of sucking is excited solely through the sense of smell, so that if the olfactory nerves of a puppy are destroyed, it never sucks. in like manner the wonderful power which a chicken possesses only a few hours after being hatched, of picking up small particles of food, seems to be started into action through the sense of hearing; for with chickens hatched by artificial heat, a good observer found that "making a noise with the finger-nail against a board, in imitation of the hen-mother, first taught them to peck at their meat."[118] i will give only one other instance of an habitual and purposeless movement. the sheldrake (_tadorna_) feeds on the sands left uncovered by the tide, and when a worm-cast is discovered, "it begins patting the ground with its feet, dancing as it were, over the hole;" and this makes the worm come to the surface. now mr. st. john says, that when his tame sheldrakes "came to ask for food, they patted the ground in an impatient and rapid manner."[119] this therefore may almost be considered as their expression of hunger. mr. bartlett informs me that the flamingo and the kagu (_rhinochetus jubatus_) when anxious to be fed, beat the ground with their feet in the same odd manner. so again kingfishers, when they catch a fish, always beat it until it is killed; and in the zoological gardens they always beat the raw meat, with which they are sometimes fed, before devouring it. we have now, i think, sufficiently shown the truth of our first principle, namely, that when any sensation, desire, dislike, &c., has led during a long series of generations to some voluntary movement, then a tendency to the performance of a similar movement will almost certainly be excited, whenever the same, or any analogous or associated sensation &c., although very weak, is experienced; notwithstanding that the movement in this case may not be of the least use. such habitual movements are often, or generally inherited; and they then differ but little from reflex actions. when we treat of the special expressions of man, the latter part of our first principle, as given at the commencement of this chapter, will be seen to hold good; namely, that when movements, associated through habit with certain states of the mind, are partially repressed by the will, the strictly involuntary muscles, as well as those which are least under the separate control of the will, are liable still to act; and their action is often highly expressive. conversely, when the will is temporarily or permanently weakened, the voluntary muscles fail before the involuntary. it is a fact familiar to pathologists, as sir c. bell remarks,[120] "that when debility arises from affection of the brain, the influence is greatest on those muscles which are, in their natural condition, most under the command of the will." we shall, also, in our future chapters, consider another proposition included in our first principle; namely, that the checking of one habitual movement sometimes requires other slight movements; these latter serving as a means of expression. chapter ii. -- general principles of expression--_continued_. the principle of antithesis--instances in the dog and cat--origin of the principle--conventional signs--the principle of antithesis has not arisen from opposite actions being consciously performed under opposite impulses. we will now consider our second principle, that of antithesis. certain states of the mind lead, as we have seen in the last chapter, to certain habitual movements which were primarily, or may still be, of service; and we shall find that when a directly opposite state of mind is induced, there is a strong and involuntary tendency to the performance of movements of a directly opposite nature, though these have never been of any service. a few striking instances of antithesis will be given, when we treat of the special expressions of man; but as, in these cases, we are particularly liable to confound conventional or artificial gestures and expressions with those which are innate or universal, and which alone deserve to rank as true expressions, i will in the present chapter almost confine myself to the lower animals. [illustration: dog in a hostile frame of mind. fig. 5] [illustration: fig. 6] [illustration: dog in a hostile frame of mind. fig. 7] when a dog approaches a strange dog or man in a savage or hostile frame of mind be walks upright and very stiffly; his head is slightly raised, or not much lowered; the tail is held erect, and quite rigid; the hairs bristle, especially along the neck and back; the pricked ears are directed forwards, and the eyes have a fixed stare: (see figs. 5 and 7). these actions, as will hereafter be explained, follow from the dog's intention to attack his enemy, and are thus to a large extent intelligible. as he prepares to spring with a savage growl on his enemy, the canine teeth are uncovered, and the ears are pressed close backwards on the head; but with these latter actions, we are not here concerned. let us now suppose that the dog suddenly discovers that the man he is approaching, is not a stranger, but his master; and let it be observed how completely and instantaneously his whole bearing is reversed. instead of walking upright, the body sinks downwards or even crouches, and is thrown into flexuous movements; his tail, instead of being held stiff and upright, is lowered and wagged from side to side; his hair instantly becomes smooth; his ears are depressed and drawn backwards, but not closely to the head; and his lips hang loosely. from the drawing back of the ears, the eyelids become elongated, and the eyes no longer appear round and staring. it should be added that the animal is at such times in an excited condition from joy; and nerve-force will be generated in excess, which naturally leads to action of some kind. not one of the above movements, so clearly expressive of affection, are of the least direct service to the animal. they are explicable, as far as i can see, solely from being in complete opposition or antithesis to the attitude and movements which, from intelligible causes, are assumed when a dog intends to fight, and which consequently are expressive of anger. i request the reader to look at the four accompanying sketches, which have been given in order to recall vividly the appearance of a dog under these two states of mind. it is, however, not a little difficult to represent affection in a dog, whilst caressing his master and wagging his tail, as the essence of the expression lies in the continuous flexuous movements. [illustration: dog carressing his master. fig. 8] we will now turn to the cat. when this animal is threatened by a dog, it arches its back in a surprising manner, erects its hair, opens its mouth and spits. but we are not here concerned with this well-known attitude, expressive of terror combined with anger; we are concerned only with that of rage or anger. this is not often seen, but may be observed when two cats are fighting together; and i have seen it well exhibited by a savage cat whilst plagued by a boy. the attitude is almost exactly the same as that of a tiger disturbed and growling over its food, which every one must have beheld in menageries. the animal assumes a crouching position, with the body extended; and the whole tail, or the tip alone, is lashed or curled from side to side. the hair is not in the least erect. thus far, the attitude and movements are nearly the same as when the animal is prepared to spring on its prey, and when, no doubt, it feels savage. but when preparing to fight, there is this difference, that the ears are closely pressed backwards; the mouth is partially opened, showing the teeth; the fore feet are occasionally struck out with protruded claws; and the animal occasionally utters a fierce growl. (see figs. 9 and 10.) all, or almost all these actions naturally follow (as hereafter to be explained), from the cat's manner and intention of attacking its enemy. [illustration: cat, savage, and prepared to fight. fig. 9] [illustration: cat in an affectionate frame of mind. fig. 10] let us now look at a cat in a directly opposite frame of mind, whilst feeling affectionate and caressing her master; and mark how opposite is her attitude in every respect. she now stands upright with her back slightly arched, which makes the hair appear rather rough, but it does not bristle; her tail, instead of being extended and lashed from side to side, is held quite still and perpendicularly upwards; her ears are erect and pointed; her mouth is closed; and she rubs against her master with a purr instead of a growl. let it further be observed how widely different is the whole bearing of an affectionate cat from that of a dog, when with his body crouching and flexuous, his tail lowered and wagging, and ears depressed, he caresses his master. this contrast in the attitudes and movements of these two carnivorous animals, under the same pleased and affectionate frame of mind, can be explained, as it appears to me, solely by their movements standing in complete antithesis to those which are naturally assumed, when these animals feel savage and are prepared either to fight or to seize their prey. in these cases of the dog and cat, there is every reason to believe that the gestures both of hostility and affection are innate or inherited; for they are almost identically the same in the different races of the species, and in all the individuals of the same race, both young and old. i will here give one other instance of antithesis in expression. i formerly possessed a large dog, who, like every other dog, was much pleased to go out walking. he showed his pleasure by trotting gravely before me with high steps, head much raised, moderately erected ears, and tail carried aloft but not stiffly. not far from my house a path branches off to the right, leading to the hot-house, which i used often to visit for a few moments, to look at my experimental plants. this was always a great disappointment to the dog, as he did not know whether i should continue my walk; and the instantaneous and complete change of expression which came over him as soon as my body swerved in the least towards the path (and i sometimes tried this as an experiment) was laughable. his look of dejection was known to every member of the family, and was called his _hot-house face_. this consisted in the head drooping much, the whole body sinking a little and remaining motionless; the ears and tail falling suddenly down, but the tail was by no means wagged. with the falling of the ears and of his great chaps, the eyes became much changed in appearance, and i fancied that they looked less bright. his aspect was that of piteous, hopeless dejection; and it was, as i have said, laughable, as the cause was so slight. every detail in his attitude was in complete opposition to his former joyful yet dignified bearing; and can be explained, as it appears to me, in no other way, except through the principle of antithesis. had not the change been so instantaneous, i should have attributed it to his lowered spirits affecting, as in the case of man, the nervous system and circulation, and consequently the tone of his whole muscular frame; and this may have been in part the cause. we will now consider how the principle of antithesis in expression has arisen. with social animals, the power of intercommunication between the members of the same community,--and with other species, between the opposite sexes, as well as between the young and the old,--is of the highest importance to them. this is generally effected by means of the voice, but it is certain that gestures and expressions are to a certain extent mutually intelligible. man not only uses inarticulate cries, gestures, and expressions, but has invented articulate language; if, indeed, the word invented can be applied to a process, completed by innumerable steps, half-consciously made. any one who has watched monkeys will not doubt that they perfectly understand each other's gestures and expression, and to a large extent, as rengger asserts,[201] those of man. an animal when going to attack another, or when afraid of another, often makes itself appear terrible, by erecting its hair, thus increasing the apparent bulk of its body, by showing its teeth, or brandishing its horns, or by uttering fierce sounds. as the power of intercommunication is certainly of high service to many animals, there is no _a priori_ improbability in the supposition, that gestures manifestly of an opposite nature to those by which certain feelings are already expressed, should at first have been voluntarily employed under the influence of an opposite state of feeling. the fact of the gestures being now innate, would be no valid objection to the belief that they were at first intentional; for if practised during many generations, they would probably at last be inherited. nevertheless it is more than doubtful, as we shall immediately see, whether any of the cases which come under our present head of antithesis, have thus originated. with conventional signs which are not innate, such as those used by the deaf and dumb and by savages, the principle of opposition or antithesis has been partially brought into play. the cistercian monks thought it sinful to speak, and as they could not avoid holding some communication, they invented a gesture language, in which the principle of opposition seems to have been employed.[202] dr. scott, of the exeter deaf and dumb institution, writes to me that "opposites are greatly used in teaching the deaf and dumb, who have a lively sense of them." nevertheless i have been surprised how few unequivocal instances can be adduced. this depends partly on all the signs having commonly had some natural origin; and partly on the practice of the deaf and dumb and of savages to contract their signs as much as possible for the sake of rapidity?[203] hence their natural source or origin often becomes doubtful or is completely lost; as is likewise the case with articulate language. many signs, moreover, which plainly stand in opposition to each other, appear to have had on both sides a significant origin. this seems to hold good with the signs used by the deal and dumb for light and darkness, for strength and weakness, &c. in a future chapter i shall endeavour to show that the opposite gestures of affirmation and negation, namely, vertically nodding and laterally shaking the head, have both probably had a natural beginning. the waving of the hand from right to left, which is used as a negative by some savages, may have been invented in imitation of shaking the head; but whether the opposite movement of waving the hand in a straight line from the face, which is used in affirmation, has arisen through antithesis or in some quite distinct manner, is doubtful. if we now turn to the gestures which are innate or common to all the individuals of the same species, and which come under the present head of antithesis, it is extremely doubtful, whether any of them were at first deliberately invented and consciously performed. with mankind the best instance of a gesture standing in direct opposition to other movements, naturally assumed under an opposite frame of mind, is that of shrugging the shoulders. this expresses impotence or an apology,--something which cannot be done, or cannot be avoided. the gesture is sometimes used consciously and voluntarily, but it is extremely improbable that it was at first deliberately invented, and afterwards fixed by habit; for not only do young children sometimes shrug their shoulders under the above states of mind, but the movement is accompanied, as will be shown in a future chapter, by various subordinate movements, which not one man in a thousand is aware of, unless he has specially attended to the subject. dogs when approaching a strange dog, may find it useful to show by their movements that they are friendly, and do not wish to fight. when two young dogs in play are growling and biting each other's faces and legs, it is obvious that they mutually understand each other's gestures and manners. there seems, indeed, some degree of instinctive knowledge in puppies and kittens, that they must not use their sharp little teeth or claws too freely in their play, though this sometimes happens and a squeal is the result; otherwise they would often injure each other's eyes. when my terrier bites my hand in play, often snarling at the same time, if he bites too hard and i say gently, gently, he goes on biting, but answers me by a few wags of the tail, which seems to say "never mind, it is all fun." although dogs do thus express, and may wish to express, to other dogs and to man, that they are in a friendly state of mind, it is incredible that they could ever have deliberately thought of drawing back and depressing their ears, instead of holding them erect,--of lowering and wagging their tails, instead of keeping them stiff and upright, &c., because they knew that these movements stood in direct opposition to those assumed under an opposite and savage frame of mind. again, when a cat, or rather when some early progenitor of the species, from feeling affectionate first slightly arched its back, held its tail perpendicularly upwards and pricked its ears, can it be believed that the animal consciously wished thus to show that its frame of mind was directly the reverse of that, when from being ready to fight or to spring on its prey, it assumed a crouching attitude, curled its tail from side to side and depressed its ears? even still less can i believe that my dog voluntarily put on his dejected attitude and "_hot-house face_," which formed so complete a contrast to his previous cheerful attitude and whole bearing. it cannot be supposed that he knew that i should understand his expression, and that he could thus soften my heart and make me give up visiting the hot-house. hence for the development of the movements which come under the present head, some other principle, distinct from the will and consciousness, must have intervened. this principle appears to be that every movement which we have voluntarily performed throughout our lives has required the action of certain muscles; and when we have performed a directly opposite movement, an opposite set of muscles has been habitually brought into play,--as in turning to the right or to the left, in pushing away or pulling an object towards us, and in lifting or lowering a weight. so strongly are our intentions and movements associated together, that if we eagerly wish an object to move in any direction, we can hardly avoid moving our bodies in the same direction, although we may be perfectly aware that this can have no influence. a good illustration of this fact has already been given in the introduction, namely, in the grotesque movements of a young and eager billiard-player, whilst watching the course of his ball. a man or child in a passion, if he tells any one in a loud voice to begone, generally moves his arm as if to push him away, although the offender may not be standing near, and although there may be not the least need to explain by a gesture what is meant. on the other hand, if we eagerly desire some one to approach us closely, we act as if pulling him towards us; and so in innumerable other instances. as the performance of ordinary movements of an opposite kind, under opposite impulses of the will, has become habitual in us and in the lower animals, so when actions of one kind have become firmly associated with any sensation or emotion, it appears natural that actions of a directly opposite kind, though of no use, should be unconsciously performed through habit and association, under the influence of a directly opposite sensation or emotion. on this principle alone can i understand how the gestures and expressions which come under the present head of antithesis have originated. if indeed they are serviceable to man or to any other animal, in aid of inarticulate cries or language, they will likewise be voluntarily employed, and the habit will thus be strengthened. but whether or not of service as a means of communication, the tendency to perform opposite movements under opposite sensations or emotions would, if we may judge by analogy, become hereditary through long practice; and there cannot be a doubt that several expressive movements due to the principle of antithesis are inherited. chapter iii. -- general principles of expression--_concluded_. the principle of direct action of the excited nervous system on the body, independently of the will and in part of habit--change of colour in the hair--trembling of the muscles--modified secretions--perspiration--expression of extreme pain--of rage, great joy, and terror--contrast between the emotions which cause and do not cause expressive movements--exciting and depressing states of the mind--summary. we now come to our third principle, namely, that certain actions which we recognize as expressive of certain states of the mind, are the direct result of the constitution of the nervous system, and have been from the first independent of the will, and, to a large extent, of habit. when the sensorium is strongly excited nerve-force is generated in excess, and is transmitted in certain directions, dependent on the connection of the nerve-cells, and, as far as the muscular system is concerned, on the nature of the movements which have been habitually practised. or the supply of nerve-force may, as it appears, be interrupted. of course every movement which we make is determined by the constitution of the nervous system; but actions performed in obedience to the will, or through habit, or through the principle of antithesis, are here as far as possible excluded. our present subject is very obscure, but, from its importance, must be discussed at some little length; and it is always advisable to perceive clearly our ignorance. the most striking case, though a rare and abnormal one, which can be adduced of the direct influence of the nervous system, when strongly affected, on the body, is the loss of colour in the hair, which has occasionally been observed after extreme terror or grief. one authentic instance has been recorded, in the case of a man brought out for execution in india, in which the change of colour was so rapid that it was perceptible to the eye.[301] another good case is that of the trembling of the muscles, which is common to man and to many, or most, of the lower animals. trembling is of no service, often of much disservice, and cannot have been at first acquired through the will, and then rendered habitual in association with any emotion. i am assured by an eminent authority that young children do not tremble, but go into convulsions under the circumstances which would induce excessive trembling in adults. trembling is excited in different individuals in very different degrees and by the most diversified causes,--by cold to the surface, before fever-fits, although the temperature of the body is then above the normal standard; in blood-poisoning, delirium tremens, and other diseases; by general failure of power in old age; by exhaustion after excessive fatigue; locally from severe injuries, such as burns; and, in an especial manner, by the passage of a catheter. of all emotions, fear notoriously is the most apt to induce trembling; but so do occasionally great anger and joy. i remember once seeing a boy who had just shot his first snipe on the wing, and his hands trembled to such a degree from delight, that he could not for some time reload his gun; and i have heard of an exactly similar case with an australian savage, to whom a gun had been lent. fine music, from the vague emotions thus excited, causes a shiver to run down the backs of some persons. there seems to be very little in common in the above several physical causes and emotions to account for trembling; and sir j. paget, to whom i am indebted for several of the above statements, informs me that the subject is a very obscure one. as trembling is sometimes caused by rage, long before exhaustion can have set in, and as it sometimes accompanies great joy, it would appear that any strong excitement of the nervous system interrupts the steady flow of nerve-force to the muscles.[302] the manner in which the secretions of the alimentary canal and of certain glands--as the liver, kidneys, or mammae are affected by strong emotions, is another excellent instance of the direct action of the sensorium on these organs, independently of the will or of any serviceable associated habit. there is the greatest difference in different persons in the parts which are thus affected, and in the degree of their affection. the heart, which goes on uninterruptedly beating night and day in so wonderful a manner, is extremely sensitive to external stimulants. the great physiologist, claude bernard,[303] has shown bow the least excitement of a sensitive nerve reacts on the heart; even when a nerve is touched so slightly that no pain can possibly be felt by the animal under experiment. hence when the mind is strongly excited, we might expect that it would instantly affect in a direct manner the heart; and this is universally acknowledged and felt to be the case. claude bernard also repeatedly insists, and this deserves especial notice, that when the heart is affected it reacts on the brain; and the state of the brain again reacts through the pneumo-gastric nerve on the heart; so that under any excitement there will be much mutual action and reaction between these, the two most important organs of the body. the vaso-motor system, which regulates the diameter of the small arteries, is directly acted on by the sensorium, as we see when a man blushes from shame; but in this latter case the checked transmission of nerve-force to the vessels of the face can, i think, be partly explained in a curious manner through habit. we shall also be able to throw some light, though very little, on the involuntary erection of the hair under the emotions of terror and rage. the secretion of tears depends, no doubt, on the connection of certain nerve-cells; but here again we can trace some few of the steps by which the flow of nerve-force through the requisite channels has become habitual under certain emotions. a brief consideration of the outward signs of some of the stronger sensations and emotions will best serve to show us, although vaguely, in how complex a manner the principle under consideration of the direct action of the excited nervous system of the body, is combined with the principle of habitually associated, serviceable movements. when animals suffer from an agony of pain, they generally writhe about with frightful contortions; and those which habitually use their voices utter piercing cries or groans. almost every muscle of the body is brought into strong action. with man the mouth may be closely compressed, or more commonly the lips are retracted, with the teeth clenched or ground together. there is said to be "gnashing of teeth" in hell; and i have plainly heard the grinding of the molar teeth of a cow which was suffering acutely from inflammation of the bowels. the female hippopotamus in the zoological gardens, when she produced her young, suffered greatly; she incessantly walked about, or rolled on her sides, opening and closing her jaws, and clattering her teeth together.[304] with man the eyes stare wildly as in horrified astonishment, or the brows are heavily contracted. perspiration bathes the body, and drops trickle down the face. the circulation and respiration are much affected. hence the nostrils are generally dilated and often quiver; or the breath may be held until the blood stagnates in the purple face. if the agony be severe and prolonged, these signs all change; utter prostration follows, with fainting or convulsions. a sensitive nerve when irritated transmits some influence to the nerve-cell, whence it proceeds; and this transmits its influence, first to the corresponding nerve-cell on the opposite side of the body, and then upwards and downwards along the cerebro-spinal column to other nerve-cells, to a greater or less extent, according to the strength of the excitement; so that, ultimately, the whole nervous system maybe affected.[305] this involuntary transmission of nerve-force may or may not be accompanied by consciousness. why the irritation of a nerve-cell should generate or liberate nerve-force is not known; but that this is the case seems to be the conclusion arrived at by all the greatest physiologists, such as muller, virchow, bernard, &c.[306] as mr. herbert spencer remarks, it may be received as an "unquestionable truth that, at any moment, the existing quantity of liberated nerve-force, which in an inscrutable way produces in us the state we call feeling, must expend itself in some direction--must generate an equivalent manifestation of force somewhere;" so that, when the cerebro-spinal system is highly excited and nerve-force is liberated in excess, it may be expended in intense sensations, active thought, violent movements, or increased activity of the glands.[307] mr. spencer further maintains that an "overflow of nerve-force, undirected by any motive, will manifestly take the most habitual routes; and, if these do not suffice, will next overflow into the less habitual ones." consequently the facial and respiratory muscles, which are the most used, will be apt to be first brought into action; then those of the upper extremities, next those of the lower, and finally those of the whole body.[308] an emotion may be very strong, but it will have little tendency to induce movements of any kind, if it has not commonly led to voluntary action for its relief or gratification; and when movements are excited, their nature is, to a large extent, determined by those which have often and voluntarily been performed for some definite end under the same emotion. great pain urges all animals, and has urged them during endless generations, to make the most violent and diversified efforts to escape from the cause of suffering. even when a limb or other separate part of the body is hurt, we often see a tendency to shake it, as if to shake off the cause, though this may obviously be impossible. thus a habit of exerting with the utmost force all the muscles will have been established, whenever great suffering is experienced. as the muscles of the chest and vocal organs are habitually used, these will be particularly liable to be acted on, and loud, harsh screams or cries will be uttered. but the advantage derived from outcries has here probably come into play in an important manner; for the young of most animals, when in distress or danger, call loudly to their parents for aid, as do the members of the same community for mutual aid. another principle, namely, the internal consciousness that the power or capacity of the nervous system is limited, will have strengthened, though in a subordinate degree, the tendency to violent action under extreme suffering. a man cannot think deeply and exert his utmost muscular force. as hippocrates long ago observed, if two pains are felt at the same time, the severer one dulls the other. martyrs, in the ecstasy of their religious fervour have often, as it would appear, been insensible to the most horrid tortures. sailors who are going to be flogged sometimes take a piece of lead into their mouths, in order to bite it with their utmost force, and thus to bear the pain. parturient women prepare to exert their muscles to the utmost in order to relieve their sufferings. we thus see that the undirected radiation of nerve-force from the nerve-cells which are first affected--the long-continued habit of attempting by struggling to escape from the cause of suffering--and the consciousness that voluntary muscular exertion relieves pain, have all probably concurred in giving a tendency to the most violent, almost convulsive, movements under extreme suffering; and such movements, including those of the vocal organs, are universally recognized as highly expressive of this condition. as the mere touching of a sensitive nerve reacts in a direct manner on the heart, severe pain will obviously react on it in like manner, but far more energetically. nevertheless, even in this case, we must not overlook the indirect effects of habit on the heart, as we shall see when we consider the signs of rage. when a man suffers from an agony of pain, the perspiration often trickles down his face; and i have been assured by a veterinary surgeon that he has frequently seen drops falling from the belly and running down the inside of the thighs of horses, and from the bodies of cattle, when thus suffering. he has observed this, when there has been no struggling which would account for the perspiration. the whole body of the female hippopotamus, before alluded to, was covered with red-coloured perspiration whilst giving birth to her young. so it is with extreme fear; the same veterinary has often seen horses sweating from this cause; as has mr. bartlett with the rhinoceros; and with man it is a well-known symptom. the cause of perspiration bursting forth in these cases is quite obscure; but it is thought by some physiologists to be connected with the failing power of the capillary circulation; and we know that the vasomotor system, which regulates the capillary circulation, is much influenced by the mind. with respect to the movements of certain muscles of the face under great suffering, as well as from other emotions, these will be best considered when we treat of the special expressions of man and of the lower animals. we will now turn to the characteristic symptoms of rage. under this powerful emotion the action of the heart is much accelerated,[309] or it may be much disturbed. the face reddens, or it becomes purple from the impeded return of the blood, or may turn deadly pale. the respiration is laboured, the chest heaves, and the dilated nostrils quiver. the whole body often trembles. the voice is affected. the teeth are clenched or ground together, and the muscular system is commonly stimulated to violent, almost frantic action. but the gestures of a man in this state usually differ from the purposeless writhings and struggles of one suffering from an agony of pain; for they represent more or less plainly the act of striking or fighting with an enemy. all these signs of rage are probably in large part, and some of them appear to be wholly, due to the direct action of the excited sensorium. but animals of all kinds, and their progenitors before them, when attacked or threatened by an enemy, have exerted their utmost powers in fighting and in defending themselves. unless an animal does thus act, or has the intention, or at least the desire, to attack its enemy, it cannot properly be said to be enraged. an inherited habit of muscular exertion will thus have been gained in association with rage; and this will directly or indirectly affect various organs, in nearly the same manner as does great bodily suffering. the heart no doubt will likewise be affected in a direct manner; but it will also in all probability be affected through habit; and all the more so from not being under the control of the will. we know that any great exertion which we voluntarily make, affects the heart, through mechanical and other principles which need not here be considered; and it was shown in the first chapter that nerve-force flows readily through habitually used channels,--through the nerves of voluntary or involuntary movement, and through those of sensation. thus even a moderate amount of exertion will tend to act on the heart; and on the principle of association, of which so many instances have been given, we may feel nearly sure that any sensation or emotion, as great pain or rage, which has habitually led to much muscular action, will immediately influence the flow of nerve-force to the heart, although there may not be at the time any muscular exertion. the heart, as i have said, will be all the more readily affected through habitual associations, as it is not under the control of the will. a man when moderately angry, or even when enraged, may command the movements of his body, but he cannot prevent his heart from beating rapidly. his chest will perhaps give a few heaves, and his nostrils just quiver, for the movements of respiration are only in part voluntary. in like manner those muscles of the face which are least obedient to the will, will sometimes alone betray a slight and passing emotion. the glands again are wholly independent of the will, and a man suffering from grief may command his features, but cannot always prevent the tears from coming into his eyes. a hungry man, if tempting food is placed before him, may not show his hunger by any outward gesture, but he cannot check the secretion of saliva. under a transport of joy or of vivid pleasure, there is a strong tendency to various purposeless movements, and to the utterance of various sounds. we see this in our young children, in their loud laughter, clapping of hands, and jumping for joy; in the bounding and barking of a dog when going out to walk with his master; and in the frisking of a horse when turned out into an open field. joy quickens the circulation, and this stimulates the brain, which again reacts on the whole body. the above purposeless movements and increased heart-action may be attributed in chief part to the excited state of the sensorium,[310] and to the consequent undirected overflow, as mr. herbert spencer insists, of nerve-force. it deserves notice, that it is chiefly the anticipation of a pleasure, and not its actual enjoyment, which leads to purposeless and extravagant movements of the body, and to the utterance of various sounds. we see this in our children when they expect any great pleasure or treat; and dogs, which have been bounding about at the sight of a plate of food, when they get it do not show their delight by any outward sign, not even by wagging their tails. now with animals of all kinds, the acquirement of almost all their pleasures, with the exception of those of warmth and rest, are associated, and have long been associated with active movements, as in the hunting or search for food, and in their courtship. moreover, the mere exertion of the muscles after long rest or confinement is in itself a pleasure, as we ourselves feel, and as we see in the play of young animals. therefore on this latter principle alone we might perhaps expect, that vivid pleasure would be apt to show itself conversely in muscular movements. with all or almost all animals, even with birds, terror causes the body to tremble. the skin becomes pale, sweat breaks out, and the hair bristles. the secretions of the alimentary canal and of the kidneys are increased, and they are involuntarily voided, owing to the relaxation of the sphincter muscles, as is known to be the case with man, and as i have seen with cattle, dogs, cats, and monkeys. the breathing is hurried. the heart beats quickly, wildly, and violently; but whether it pumps the blood more efficiently through the body may be doubted, for the surface seems bloodless and the strength of the muscles soon fails. in a frightened horse i have felt through the saddle the beating of the heart so plainly that i could have counted the beats. the mental faculties are much disturbed. utter prostration soon follows, and even fainting. a terrified canary-bird has been seen not only to tremble and to turn white about the base of the bill, but to faint;[311] and i once caught a robin in a room, which fainted so completely, that for a time i thought it dead. most of these symptoms are probably the direct result, independently of habit, of the disturbed state of the sensorium; but it is doubtful whether they ought to be wholly thus accounted for. when an animal is alarmed it almost always stands motionless for a moment, in order to collect its senses and to ascertain the source of danger, and sometimes for the sake of escaping detection. but headlong flight soon follows, with no husbanding of the strength as in fighting, and the animal continues to fly as long as the danger lasts, until utter prostration, with failing respiration and circulation, with all the muscles quivering and profuse sweating, renders further flight impossible. hence it does not seem improbable that the principle of associated habit may in part account for, or at least augment, some of the above-named characteristic symptoms of extreme terror. that the principle of associated habit has played an important part in causing the movements expressive of the foregoing several strong emotions and sensations, we may, i think, conclude from considering firstly, some other strong emotions which do not ordinarily require for their relief or gratification any voluntary movement; and secondly the contrast in nature between the so-called exciting and depressing states of the mind. no emotion is stronger than maternal love; but a mother may feel the deepest love for her helpless infant, and yet not show it by any outward sign; or only by slight caressing movements, with a gentle smile and tender eyes. but let any one intentionally injure her infant, and see what a change! how she starts up with threatening aspect, how her eyes sparkle and her face reddens, how her bosom heaves, nostrils dilate, and heart beats; for anger, and not maternal love, has habitually led to action. the love between the opposite sexes is widely different from maternal love; and when lovers meet, we know that their hearts beat quickly, their breathing is hurried, and their faces flush; for this love is not inactive like that of a mother for her infant. a man may have his mind filled with the blackest hatred or suspicion, or be corroded with envy or jealousy, but as these feelings do not at once lead to action, and as they commonly last for some time, they are not shown by any outward sign, excepting that a man in this state assuredly does not appear cheerful or good-tempered. if indeed these feelings break out into overt acts, rage takes their place, and will be plainly exhibited. painters can hardly portray suspicion, jealousy, envy, &c., except by the aid of accessories which tell the tale; and poets use such vague and fanciful expressions as "green-eyed jealousy." spenser describes suspicion as "foul, ill-favoured, and grim, under his eyebrows looking still askance," &c.; shakespeare speaks of envy "as lean-faced in her loathsome case;" and in another place he says, "no black envy shall make my grave;" and again as "above pale envy's threatening reach." emotions and sensations have often been classed as exciting or depressing. when all the organs of the body and mind,--those of voluntary and involuntary movement, of perception, sensation, thought, &c.,--perform their functions more energetically and rapidly than usual, a man or animal may be said to be excited, and, under an opposite state, to be depressed. anger and joy are from the first exciting emotions, and they naturally lead, more especially the former, to energetic movements, which react on the heart and this again on the brain. a physician once remarked to me as a proof of the exciting nature of anger, that a man when excessively jaded will sometimes invent imaginary offences and put himself into a passion, unconsciously for the sake of reinvigorating himself; and since hearing this remark, i have occasionally recognized its full truth. several other states of mind appear to be at first exciting, but soon become depressing to an extreme degree. when a mother suddenly loses her child, sometimes she is frantic with grief, and must be considered to be in an excited state; she walks wildly about, tears her hair or clothes, and wrings her hands. this latter action is perhaps due to the principle of antithesis, betraying an inward sense of helplessness and that nothing can be done. the other wild and violent movements may be in part explained by the relief experienced through muscular exertion, and in part by the undirected overflow of nerve-force from the excited sensorium. but under the sudden loss of a beloved person, one of the first and commonest thoughts which occurs, is that something more might have been done to save the lost one. an excellent observer,[312] in describing the behaviour of a girl at the sudden death of her father, says she "went about the house wringing her hands like a creature demented, saying 'it was her fault;' 'i should never have left him;' 'if i had only sat up with him,'" &c. with such ideas vividly present before the mind, there would arise, through the principle of associated habit, the strongest tendency to energetic action of some kind. as soon as the sufferer is fully conscious that nothing can be done, despair or deep sorrow takes the place of frantic grief. the sufferer sits motionless, or gently rocks to and fro; the circulation becomes languid; respiration is almost forgotten, and deep sighs are drawn. pain, if severe, soon induces extreme depression or prostration; but it is at first a stimulant and excites to action, as we see when we whip a horse, and as is shown by the horrid tortures inflicted in foreign lands on exhausted dray-bullocks, to rouse them to renewed exertion. fear again is the most depressing of all the emotions; and it soon induces utter, helpless prostration, as if in consequence of, or in association with, the most violent and prolonged attempts to escape from the danger, though no such attempts have actually been made. nevertheless, even extreme fear often acts at first as a powerful stimulant. a man or animal driven through terror to desperation, is endowed with wonderful strength, and is notoriously dangerous in the highest degree. on the whole we may conclude that the principle of the direct action of the sensorium on the body, due to the constitution of the nervous system, and from the first independent of the will, has been highly influential in determining many expressions. good instances are afforded by the trembling of the muscles, the sweating of the skin, the modified secretions of the alimentary canal and glands, under various emotions and sensations. but actions of this kind are often combined with others, which follow from our first principle, namely, that actions which have often been of direct or indirect service, under certain states of the mind, in order to gratify or relieve certain sensations, desires, &c., are still performed under analogous circumstances through mere habit although of no service. we have combinations of this kind, at least in part, in the frantic gestures of rage and in the writhings of extreme pain; and, perhaps, in the increased action of the heart and of the respiratory organs. even when these and other emotions or sensations are aroused in a very feeble manner, there will still be a tendency to similar actions, owing to the force of long-associated habit; and those actions which are least under voluntary control will generally be longest retained. our second principle of antithesis has likewise occasionally come into play. finally, so many expressive movements can be explained, as i trust will be seen in the course of this volume, through the three principles which have now been discussed, that we may hope hereafter to see all thus explained, or by closely analogous principles. it is, however, often impossible to decide how much weight ought to be attributed, in each particular case, to one of our principles, and how much to another; and very many points in the theory of expression remain inexplicable. chapter iv. -- means of expression in animals. the emission of sounds--vocal sounds--sounds otherwise produced--erection of the dermal appendages, hairs, feathers, &c., under the emotions of anger and terror--the drawing back of the ears as a preparation for fighting, and as an expression of anger--erection of the ears and raising the head, a sign of attention. in this and the following chapter i will describe, but only in sufficient detail to illustrate my subject, the expressive movements, under different states of the mind, of some few well-known animals. but before considering them in due succession, it will save much useless repetition to discuss certain means of expression common to most of them. _the emission of sounds_.--with many kinds of animals, man included, the vocal organs are efficient in the highest degree as a means of expression. we have seen, in the last chapter, that when the sensorium is strongly excited, the muscles of the body are generally thrown into violent action; and as a consequence, loud sounds are uttered, however silent the animal may generally be, and although the sounds may be of no use. hares and rabbits for instance, never, i believe, use their vocal organs except in the extremity of suffering; as, when a wounded hare is killed by the sportsman, or when a young rabbit is caught by a stoat. cattle and horses suffer great pain in silence; but when this is excessive, and especially when associated with terror, they utter fearful sounds. i have often recognized, from a distance on the pampas, the agonized death-bellow of the cattle, when caught by the lasso and hamstrung. it is said that horses, when attacked by wolves, utter loud and peculiar screams of distress. involuntary and purposeless contractions of the muscles of the chest and glottis, excited in the above manner, may have first given rise to the emission of vocal sounds. but the voice is now largely used by many animals for various purposes; and habit seems to have played an important part in its employment under other circumstances. naturalists have remarked, i believe with truth, that social animals, from habitually using their vocal organs as a means of intercommunication, use them on other occasions much more freely than other animals. but there are marked exceptions to this rule, for instance, with the rabbit. the principle, also, of association, which is so widely extended in its power, has likewise played its part. hence it follows that the voice, from having been habitually employed as a serviceable aid under certain conditions, inducing pleasure, pain, rage, &c., is commonly used whenever the same sensations or emotions are excited, under quite different conditions, or in a lesser degree. the sexes of many animals incessantly call for each other during the breeding-season; and in not a few cases, the male endeavours thus to charm or excite the female. this, indeed, seems to have been the primeval use and means of development of the voice, as i have attempted to show in my 'descent of man.' thus the use of the vocal organs will have become associated with the anticipation of the strongest pleasure which animals are capable of feeling. animals which live in society often call to each other when separated, and evidently feel much joy at meeting; as we see with a horse, on the return of his companion, for whom he has been neighing. the mother calls incessantly for her lost young ones; for instance, a cow for her calf; and the young of many animals call for their mothers. when a flock of sheep is scattered, the ewes bleat incessantly for their lambs, and their mutual pleasure at coming together is manifest. woe betide the man who meddles with the young of the larger and fiercer quadrupeds, if they hear the cry of distress from their young. rage leads to the violent exertion of all the muscles, including those of the voice; and some animals, when enraged, endeavour to strike terror into their enemies by its power and harshness, as the lion does by roaring, and the dog by growling. i infer that their object is to strike terror, because the lion at the same time erects the hair of its mane, and the dog the hair along its back, and thus they make themselves appear as large and terrible as possible. rival males try to excel and challenge each other by their voices, and this leads to deadly contests. thus the use of the voice will have become associated with the emotion of anger, however it may be aroused. we have also seen that intense pain, like rage, leads to violent outcries, and the exertion of screaming by itself gives some relief; and thus the use of the voice will have become associated with suffering of any kind. the cause of widely different sounds being uttered under different emotions and sensations is a very obscure subject. nor does the rule always hold good that there is any marked difference. for instance with the dog, the bark of anger and that of joy do not differ much, though they can be distinguished. it is not probable that any precise explanation of the cause or source of each particular sound, under different states of the mind, will ever be given. we now that some animals, after being domesticated, have acquired the habit of uttering sounds which were not natural to them.[401] thus domestic dogs, and even tamed jackals, have learnt to bark, which is a noise not proper to any species of the genus, with the exception of the _canis latrans_ of north america, which is said to bark. some breeds, also, of the domestic pigeon have learnt to coo in a new and quite peculiar manner. the character of the human voice, under the influence of various emotions, has been discussed by mr. herbert spencer[402] in his interesting essay on music. he clearly shows that the voice alters much under different conditions, in loudness and in quality, that is, in resonance and _timbre_, in pitch and intervals. no one can listen to an eloquent orator or preacher, or to a man calling angrily to another, or to one expressing astonishment, without being struck with the truth of mr. spencer's remarks. it is curious how early in life the modulation of the voice becomes expressive. with one of my children, under the age of two years, i clearly perceived that his humph of assent was rendered by a slight modulation strongly emphatic; and that by a peculiar whine his negative expressed obstinate determination. mr. spencer further shows that emotional speech, in all the above respects is intimately related to vocal music, and consequently to instrumental music; and he attempts to explain the characteristic qualities of both on physiological grounds--namely, on "the general law that a feeling is a stimulus to muscular action." it may be admitted that the voice is affected through this law; but the explanation appears to me too general and vague to throw much light on the various differences, with the exception of that of loudness, between ordinary speech and emotional speech, or singing. this remark holds good, whether we believe that the various qualities of the voice originated in speaking under the excitement of strong feelings, and that these qualities have subsequently been transferred to vocal music; or whether we believe, as i maintain, that the habit of uttering musical sounds was first developed, as a means of courtship, in the early progenitors of man, and thus became associated with the strongest emotions of which they were capable,--namely, ardent love, rivalry and triumph. that animals utter musical notes is familiar to every one, as we may daily hear in the singing of birds. it is a more remarkable fact that an ape, one of the gibbons, produces an exact octave of musical sounds, ascending and descending the scale by halftones; so that this monkey "alone of brute mammals may be said to sing."[403] from this fact, and from the analogy of other animals, i have been led to infer that the progenitors of man probably uttered musical tones, before they had acquired the power of articulate speech; and that consequently, when the voice is used under any strong emotion, it tends to assume, through the principle of association, a musical character. we can plainly perceive, with some of the lower animals, that the males employ their voices to please the females, and that they themselves take pleasure in their own vocal utterances; but why particular sounds are uttered, and why these give pleasure cannot at present be explained. that the pitch of the voice bears some relation to certain states of feeling is tolerably clear. a person gently complaining of ill-treatment, or slightly suffering, almost always speaks in a high-pitched voice. dogs, when a little impatient, often make a high piping note through their noses, which at once strikes us as plaintive;[404] but how difficult it is to know whether the sound is essentially plaintive, or only appears so in this particular case, from our having learnt by experience what it means! rengger, states[405] that the monkeys (_cebus azaroe_), which he kept in paraguay, expressed astonishment by a half-piping, half-snarling noise; anger or impatience, by repeating the sound _hu hu_ in a deeper, grunting voice; and fright or pain, by shrill screams. on the other hand, with mankind, deep groans and high piercing screams equally express an agony of pain. laughter maybe either high or low; so that, with adult men, as haller long ago remarked,[406] the sound partakes of the character of the vowels (as pronounced in german) _o_ and _a_; whilst with children and women, it has more of the character of _e_ and _i_; and these latter vowel-sounds naturally have, as helmholtz has shown, a higher pitch than the former; yet both tones of laughter equally express enjoyment or amusement. in considering the mode in which vocal utterances express emotion, we are naturally led to inquire into the cause of what is called "expression" in music. upon this point mr. litchfield, who has long attended to the subject of music, has been so kind as to give me the following remarks:--"the question, what is the essence of musical 'expression' involves a number of obscure points, which, so far as i am aware, are as yet unsolved enigmas. up to a certain point, however, any law which is found to hold as to the expression of the emotions by simple sounds must apply to the more developed mode of expression in song, which may be taken as the primary type of all music. a great part of the emotional effect of a song depends on the character of the action by which the sounds are produced. in songs, for instance, which express great vehemence of passion, the effect often chiefly depends on the forcible utterance of some one or two characteristic passages which demand great exertion of vocal force; and it will be frequently noticed that a song of this character fails of its proper effect when sung by a voice of sufficient power and range to give the characteristic passages without much exertion. this is, no doubt, the secret of the loss of effect so often produced by the transposition of a song from one key to another. the effect is thus seen to depend not merely on the actual sounds, but also in part on the nature of the action which produces the sounds. indeed it is obvious that whenever we feel the 'expression' of a song to be due to its quickness or slowness of movement--to smoothness of flow, loudness of utterance, and so on--we are, in fact, interpreting the muscular actions which produce sound, in the same way in which we interpret muscular action generally. but this leaves unexplained the more subtle and more specific effect which we call the musical expression of the song--the delight given by its melody, or even by the separate sounds which make up the melody. this is an effect indefinable in language--one which, so far as i am aware, no one has been able to analyse, and which the ingenious speculation of mr. herbert spencer as to the origin of music leaves quite unexplained. for it is certain that the melodic effect of a series of sounds does not depend in the least on their loudness or softness, or on their absolute pitch. a tune is always the same tune, whether it is sung loudly or softly, by a child or a man; whether it is played on a flute or on a trombone. the purely musical effect of any sound depends on its place in what is technically called a 'scale;' the same sound producing absolutely different effects on the ear, according as it is heard in connection with one or another series of sounds. "it is on this relative association of the sounds that all the essentially characteristic effects which are summed up in the phrase 'musical expression,' depend. but why certain associations of sounds have such-and-such effects, is a problem which yet remains to be solved. these effects must indeed, in some way or other, be connected with the well-known arithmetical relations between the rates of vibration of the sounds which form a musical scale. and it is possible--but this is merely a suggestion--that the greater or less mechanical facility with which the vibrating apparatus of the human larynx passes from one state of vibration to another, may have been a primary cause of the greater or less pleasure produced by various sequences of sounds." but leaving aside these complex questions and confining ourselves to the simpler sounds, we can, at least, see some reasons for the association of certain kinds of sounds with certain states of mind. a scream, for instance, uttered by a young animal, or by one of the members of a community, as a call for assistance, will naturally be loud, prolonged, and high, so as to penetrate to a distance. for helmholtz has shown[407] that, owing to the shape of the internal cavity of the human ear and its consequent power of resonance, high notes produce a particularly strong impression. when male animals utter sounds in order to please the females, they would naturally employ those which are sweet to the ears of the species; and it appears that the same sounds are often pleasing to widely different animals, owing to the similarity of their nervous systems, as we ourselves perceive in the singing of birds and even in the chirping of certain tree-frogs giving us pleasure. on the other hand, sounds produced in order to strike terror into an enemy, would naturally be harsh or displeasing. whether the principle of antithesis has come into play with sounds, as might perhaps have been expected, is doubtful. the interrupted, laughing or tittering sounds made by man and by various kinds of monkeys when pleased, are as different as possible from the prolonged screams of these animals when distressed. the deep grunt of satisfaction uttered by a pig, when pleased with its food, is widely different from its harsh scream of pain or terror. but with the dog, as lately remarked, the bark of anger and that of joy are sounds which by no means stand in opposition to each other; and so it is in some other cases. there is another obscure point, namely, whether the sounds which are produced under various states of the mind determine the shape of the mouth, or whether its shape is not determined by independent causes, and the sound thus modified. when young infants cry they open their mouths widely, and this, no doubt, is necessary for pouring forth a full volume of sound; but the mouth then assumes, from a quite distinct cause, an almost quadrangular shape, depending, as will hereafter be explained, on the firm closing of the eyelids, and consequent drawing up of the upper lip. how far this square shape of the mouth modifies the wailing or crying sound, i am not prepared to say; but we know from the researches of helmholtz and others that the form of the cavity of the mouth and lips determines the nature and pitch of the vowel sounds which are produced. it will also be shown in a future chapter that, under the feeling of contempt or disgust, there is a tendency, from intelligible causes, to blow out of the mouth or nostrils, and this produces sounds like pooh or pish. when any one is startled or suddenly astonished, there is an instantaneous tendency, likewise from an intelligible cause, namely, to be ready for prolonged exertion, to open the mouth widely, so as to draw a deep and rapid inspiration. when the next full expiration follows, the mouth is slightly closed, and the lips, from causes hereafter to be discussed, are somewhat protruded; and this form of the mouth, if the voice be at all exerted, produces, according to helmholtz, the sound of the vowel _o_. certainly a deep sound of a prolonged _oh!_ may be heard from a whole crowd of people immediately after witnessing any astonishing spectacle. if, together with surprise, pain be felt, there is a tendency to contract all the muscles of the body, including those of the face, and the lips will then be drawn back; and this will perhaps account for the sound becoming higher and assuming the character of _ah!_ or _ach!_ as fear causes all the muscles of the body to tremble, the voice naturally becomes tremulous, and at the same time husky from the dryness of the mouth, owing to the salivary glands failing to act. why the laughter of man and the tittering of monkeys should be a rapidly reiterated sound, cannot be explained. during the utterance of these sounds, the mouth is transversely elongated by the corners being drawn backwards and upwards; and of this fact an explanation will be attempted in a future chapter. but the whole subject of the differences of the sounds produced under different states of the mind is so obscure, that i have succeeded in throwing hardly any light on it; and the remarks which i have made, have but little significance. [illustration: sound producing quills from tail of a porcupine. fig. 11] all the sounds hitherto noticed depend on the respiratory organs; but sounds produced by wholly different means are likewise expressive. rabbits stamp loudly on the ground as a signal to their comrades; and if a man knows how to do so properly, he may on a quiet evening hear the rabbits answering him all around. these animals, as well as some others, also stamp on the ground when made angry. porcupines rattle their quills and vibrate their tails when angered; and one behaved in this manner when a live snake was placed in its compartment. the quills on the tail are very different from those on the body: they are short, hollow, thin like a goose-quill, with their ends transversely truncated, so that they are open; they are supported on long, thin, elastic foot-stalks. now, when the tail is rapidly shaken, these hollow quills strike against each other and produce, as i heard in the presence of mr. bartlett, a peculiar continuous sound. we can, i think, understand why porcupines have been provided, through the modification of their protective spines, with this special sound-producing instrument. they are nocturnal animals, and if they scented or heard a prowling beast of prey, it would be a great advantage to them in the dark to give warning to their enemy what they were, and that they were furnished with dangerous spines. they would thus escape being attacked. they are, as i may add, so fully conscious of the power of their weapons, that when enraged they will charge backwards with their spines erected, yet still inclined backwards. many birds during their courtship produce diversified sounds by means of specially adapted feathers. storks, when excited, make a loud clattering noise with their beaks. some snakes produce a grating or rattling noise. many insects stridulate by rubbing together specially modified parts of their hard integuments. this stridulation generally serves as a sexual charm or call; but it is likewise used to express different emotions.[408] every one who has attended to bees knows that their humming changes when they are angry; and this serves as a warning that there is danger of being stung. i have made these few remarks because some writers have laid so much stress on the vocal and respiratory organs as having been specially adapted for expression, that it was advisable to show that sounds otherwise produced serve equally well for the same purpose. _erection of the dermal appendages_.--hardly any expressive movement is so general as the involuntary erection of the hairs, feathers and other dermal appendages; for it is common throughout three of the great vertebrate classes. these appendages are erected under the excitement of anger or terror; more especially when these emotions are combined, or quickly succeed each other. the action serves to make the animal appear larger and more frightful to its enemies or rivals, and is generally accompanied by various voluntary movements adapted for the same purpose, and by the utterance of savage sounds. mr. bartlett, who has had such wide experience with animals of all kinds, does not doubt that this is the case; but it is a different question whether the power of erection was primarily acquired for this special purpose. i will first give a considerable body of facts showing how general this action is with mammals, birds and reptiles; retaining what i have to say in regard to man for a future chapter. mr. sutton, the intelligent keeper in the zoological gardens, carefully observed for me the chimpanzee and orang; and he states that when they are suddenly frightened, as by a thunderstorm, or when they are made angry, as by being teased, their hair becomes erect. i saw a chimpanzee who was alarmed at the sight of a black coalheaver, and the hair rose all over his body; he made little starts forward as if to attack the man, without any real intention of doing so, but with the hope, as the keeper remarked, of frightening him. the gorilla, when enraged, is described by mr. ford[409] as having his crest of hair "erect and projecting forward, his nostrils dilated, and his under lip thrown down; at the same time uttering his characteristic yell, designed, it would seem, to terrify his antagonists." i saw the hair on the anubis baboon, when angered bristling along the back, from the neck to the loins, but not on the rump or other parts of the body. i took a stuffed snake into the monkey-house, and the hair on several of the species instantly became erect; especially on their tails, as i particularly noticed with the _cereopithecus nictitans_. brehm states[410] that the _midas aedipus_ (belonging to the american division) when excited erects its mane, in order, as he adds, to make itself as frightful as possible. with the carnivora the erection of the hair seems to be almost universal, often accompanied by threatening movements, the uncovering of the teeth and the utterance of savage growls. in the herpestes, i have seen the hair on end over nearly the whole body, including the tail; and the dorsal crest is erected in a conspicuous manner by the hyaena and proteles. the enraged lion erects his mane. the bristling of the hair along the neck and back of the dog, and over the whole body of the cat, especially on the tail, is familiar to every one. with the cat it apparently occurs only under fear; with the dog, under anger and fear; but not, as far as i have observed, under abject fear, as when a dog is going to be flogged by a severe gamekeeper. if, however, the dog shows fight, as sometimes happens, up goes his hair. i have often noticed that the hair of a dog is particularly liable to rise, if he is half angry and half afraid, as on beholding some object only indistinctly seen in the dusk. i have been assured by a veterinary surgeon that he has often seen the hair erected on horses and cattle, on which he had operated and was again going to operate. when i showed a stuffed snake to a peccary, the hair rose in a wonderful manner along its back; and so it does with the boar when enraged. an elk which gored a man to death in the united states, is described as first brandishing his antlers, squealing with rage and stamping on the ground; "at length his hair was seen to rise and stand on end," and then he plunged forward to the attack.[411] the hair likewise becomes erect on goats, and, as i hear from mr. blyth, on some indian antelopes. i have seen it erected on the hairy ant-eater; and on the agouti, one of the rodents. a female bat,[412] which reared her young under confinement, when any one looked into the cage "erected the fur on her back, and bit viciously at intruding fingers." birds belonging to all the chief orders ruffle their feathers when angry or frightened. every one must have seen two cocks, even quite young birds, preparing to fight with erected neck-hackles; nor can these feathers when erected serve as a means of defence, for cock-fighters have found by experience that it is advantageous to trim them. the male ruff (_machetes pugnax_) likewise erects its collar of feathers when fighting. when a dog approaches a common hen with her chickens, she spreads out her wings, raises her tail, ruffles all her feathers, and looking as ferocious as possible, dashes at the intruder. the tail is not always held in exactly the same position; it is sometimes so much erected, that the central feathers, as in the accompanying drawing, almost touch the back. swans, when angered, likewise raise their wings and tail, and erect their feathers. they open their beaks, and make by paddling little rapid starts forwards, against any one who approaches the water's edge too closely. tropic birds[413] when disturbed on their nests are said not to fly away, but "merely to stick out their feathers and scream." the barn-owl, when approached "instantly swells out its plumage, extends its wings and tail, hisses and clacks its mandibles with force and rapidity."[414] so do other kinds of owls. hawks, as i am informed by mr. jenner weir, likewise ruffle their feathers, and spread out their wings and tail under similar circumstances. some kinds of parrots erect their feathers; and i have seen this action in the cassowary, when angered at the sight of an ant-eater. young cuckoos in the nest, raise their feathers, open their mouths widely, and make themselves as frightful as possible. [illustration: hen driving away a dog from her chickens. fig. 12] {illust. caption = fig. 12--hen driving away a dog from her chickens. drawn from life by mr. wood.} [illustration: swan driving away an intruder. fig 13] {illust. caption = fig. 13.--swan driving away an intruder. drawn from life by mr. wood.} small birds, also, as i hear from mr. weir, such as various finches, buntings and warblers, when angry, ruffle all their feathers, or only those round the neck; or they spread out their wings and tail-feathers. with their plumage in this state, they rush at each other with open beaks and threatening gestures. mr. weir concludes from his large experience that the erection of the feathers is caused much more by anger than by fear. he gives as an instance a hybrid goldfinch of a most irascible disposition, which when approached too closely by a servant, instantly assumes the appearance of a ball of ruffled feathers. he believes that birds when frightened, as a general rule, closely adpress all their feathers, and their consequently diminished size is often astonishing. as soon as they recover from their fear or surprise, the first thing which they do is to shake out their feathers. the best instances of this adpression of the feathers and apparent shrinking of the body from fear, which mr. weir has noticed, has been in the quail and grass-parrakeet.[415] the habit is intelligible in these birds from their being accustomed, when in danger, either to squat on the ground or to sit motionless on a branch, so as to escape detection. though, with birds, anger may be the chief and commonest cause of the erection of the feathers, it is probable that young cuckoos when looked at in the nest, and a hen with her chickens when approached by a dog, feel at least some terror. mr. tegetmeier informs me that with game-cocks, the erection of the feathers on the head has long been recognized in the cock-pit as a sign of cowardice. the males of some lizards, when fighting together during their courtship, expand their throat pouches or frills, and erect their dorsal crests.[416] but dr. gunther does not believe that they can erect their separate spines or scales. we thus see how generally throughout the two higher vertebrate classes, and with some reptiles, the dermal appendages are erected under the influence of anger and fear. the movement is effected, as we know from kolliker's interesting discovery, by the contraction of minute, unstriped, involuntary muscles,[417] often called _arrectores pili_, which are attached to the capsules of the separate hairs, feathers, &c. by the contraction of these muscles the hairs can be instantly erected, as we see in a dog, being at the same time drawn a little out of their sockets; they are afterwards quickly depressed. the vast number of these minute muscles over the whole body of a hairy quadruped is astonishing. the erection of the hair is, however, aided in some cases, as with that on the head of a man, by the striped and voluntary muscles of the underlying _panniculus carnosus_. it is by the action of these latter muscles, that the hedgehog erects its spines. it appears, also, from the researches of leydig[418] and others, that striped fibres extend from the panniculus to some of the larger hairs, such as the vibrissae of certain quadrupeds. the _arrectores pili_ contract not only under the above emotions, but from the application of cold to the surface. i remember that my mules and dogs, brought from a lower and warmer country, after spending a night on the bleak cordillera, had the hair all over their bodies as erect as under the greatest terror. we see the same action in our own _goose-skin_ during the chill before a fever-fit. mr. lister has also found,[419] that tickling a neighbouring part of the skin causes the erection and protrusion of the hairs. from these facts it is manifest that the erection of the dermal appendages is a reflex action, independent of the will; and this action must be looked at, when, occurring under the influence of anger or fear, not as a power acquired for the sake of some advantage, but as an incidental result, at least to a large extent, of the sensorium being affected. the result, in as far as it is incidental, may be compared with the profuse sweating from an agony of pain or terror. nevertheless, it is remarkable how slight an excitement often suffices to cause the hair to become erect; as when two dogs pretend to fight together in play. we have, also, seen in a large number of animals, belonging to widely distinct classes, that the erection of the hair or feathers is almost always accompanied by various voluntary movements--by threatening gestures, opening the mouth, uncovering the teeth, spreading out of the wings and tail by birds, and by the utterance of harsh sounds; and the purpose of these voluntary movements is unmistakable. therefore it seems hardly credible that the co-ordinated erection of the dermal appendages, by which the animal is made to appear larger and more terrible to its enemies or rivals, should be altogether an incidental and purposeless result of the disturbance of the sensorium. this seems almost as incredible as that the erection by the hedgehog of its spines, or of the quills by the porcupine, or of the ornamental plumes by many birds during their courtship, should all be purposeless actions. we here encounter a great difficulty. how can the contraction of the unstriped and involuntary _arrectores pili_ have been co-ordinated with that of various voluntary muscles for the same special purpose? if we could believe that the arrectores primordially had been voluntary muscles, and had since lost their stripes and become involuntary, the case would be comparatively simple. i am not, however, aware that there is any evidence in favour of this view; although the reversed transition would not have presented any great difficulty, as the voluntary muscles are in an unstriped condition in the embryos of the higher animals, and in the larvae of some crustaceans. moreover in the deeper layers of the skin of adult birds, the muscular network is, according to leydig,[420] in a transitional condition; the fibres exhibiting only indications of transverse striation. another explanation seems possible. we may admit that originally the _arrectores pili_ were slightly acted on in a direct manner, under the influence of rage and terror, by the disturbance of the nervous system; as is undoubtedly the case with our so-called _goose-skin_ before a fever-fit. animals have been repeatedly excited by rage and terror during many generations; and consequently the direct effects of the disturbed nervous system on the dermal appendages will almost certainly have been increased through habit and through the tendency of nerve-force to pass readily along accustomed channels. we shall find this view of the force of habit strikingly confirmed in a future chapter, where it will be shown that the hair of the insane is affected in an extraordinary manner, owing to their repeated accesses of fury and terror. as soon as with animals the power of erection had thus been strengthened or increased, they must often have seen the hairs or feathers erected in rival and enraged males, and the bulk of their bodies thus increased. in this case it appears possible that they might have wished to make themselves appear larger and more terrible to their enemies, by voluntarily assuming a threatening attitude and uttering harsh cries; such attitudes and utterances after a time becoming through habit instinctive. in this manner actions performed by the contraction of voluntary muscles might have been combined for the same special purpose with those effected by involuntary muscles. it is even possible that animals, when excited and dimly conscious of some change in the state of their hair, might act on it by repeated exertions of their attention and will; for we have reason to believe that the will is able to influence in an obscure manner the action of some unstriped or involuntary muscles, as in the period of the peristaltic movements of the intestines, and in the contraction of the bladder. nor must we overlook the part which variation and natural selection may have played; for the males which succeeded in making themselves appear the most terrible to their rivals, or to their other enemies, if not of overwhelming power, will on an average have left more offspring to inherit their characteristic qualities, whatever these may be and however first acquired, than have other males. _the inflation of the body, and other means of exciting fear in an enemy_.--certain amphibians and reptiles, which either have no spines to erect, or no muscles by which they can be erected, enlarge themselves when alarmed or angry by inhaling air. this is well known to be the case with toads and frogs. the latter animal is made, in aesop's fable of the 'ox and the frog,' to blow itself up from vanity and envy until it burst. this action must have been observed during the most ancient times, as, according to mr. hensleigh wedgwood,[421] the word _toad_ expresses in all the languages of europe the habit of swelling. it has been observed with some of the exotic species in the zoological gardens; and dr. gunther believes that it is general throughout the group. judging from analogy, the primary purpose probably was to make the body appear as large and frightful as possible to an enemy; but another, and perhaps more important secondary advantage is thus gained. when frogs are seized by snakes, which are their chief enemies, they enlarge themselves wonderfully; so that if the snake be of small size, as dr. gunther informs me, it cannot swallow the frog, which thus escapes being devoured. chameleons and some other lizards inflate themselves when angry. thus a species inhabiting oregon, the _tapaya douglasii_, is slow in its movements and does not bite, but has a ferocious aspect; "when irritated it springs in a most threatening manner at anything pointed at it, at the same time opening its mouth wide and hissing audibly, after which it inflates its body, and shows other marks of anger."[422] several kinds of snakes likewise inflate themselves when irritated. the puff-adder (_clotho arietans_) is remarkable in this respect; but i believe, after carefully watching these animals, that they do not act thus for the sake of increasing their apparent bulk, but simply for inhaling a large supply of air, so as to produce their surprisingly loud, harsh, and prolonged hissing sound. the cobras-de-capello, when irritated, enlarge themselves a little, and hiss moderately; but, at the same time they lift their heads aloft, and dilate by means of their elongated anterior ribs, the skin on each side of the neck into a large flat disk,--the so-called hood. with their widely opened mouths, they then assume a terrific aspect. the benefit thus derived ought to be considerable, in order to compensate for the somewhat lessened rapidity (though this is still great) with which, when dilated, they can strike at their enemies or prey; on the same principle that a broad, thin piece of wood cannot be moved through the air so quickly as a small round stick. an innocuous snake, the _trovidonotus macrophthalmus_, an inhabitant of india, likewise dilates its neck when irritated; and consequently is often mistaken for its compatriot, the deadly cobra.[423] this resemblance perhaps serves as some protection to the tropidonotus. another innocuous species, the dasypeltis of south africa, blows itself out, distends its neck, hisses and darts at an intruder.[424] many other snakes hiss under similar circumstances. they also rapidly vibrate their protruded tongues; and this may aid in increasing their terrific appearance. snakes possess other means of producing sounds besides hissing. many years ago i observed in south america that a venomous trigonocephalus, when disturbed, rapidly vibrated the end of its tail, which striking against the dry grass and twigs produced a rattling noise that could be distinctly heard at the distance of six feet.[425] the deadly and fierce _echis carinata_ of india produces "a curious prolonged, almost hissing sound in a very different manner, namely by rubbing the sides of the folds of its body against each other," whilst the head remains in almost the same position. the scales on the sides, and not on other parts of the body, are strongly keeled, with the keels toothed like a saw; and as the coiled-up animal rubs its sides together, these grate against each other.[426] lastly, we have the well-known case of the rattle-snake. he who has merely shaken the rattle of a dead snake, can form no just idea of the sound produced by the living animal. professor shaler states that it is indistinguishable from that made by the male of a large cicada (an homopterous insect), which inhabits the same district.[427] in the zoological gardens, when the rattle-snakes and puff-adders were greatly excited at the same time, i was much struck at the similarity of the sound produced by them; and although that made by the rattle-snake is louder and shriller than the hissing of the puff-adder, yet when standing at some yards distance i could scarcely distinguish the two. for whatever purpose the sound is produced by the one species, i can hardly doubt that it serves for the same purpose in the other species; and i conclude from the threatening gestures made at the same time by many snakes, that their hissing,--the rattling of the rattle-snake and of the tail of the trigonocephalus,--the grating of the scales of the echis,--and the dilatation of the hood of the cobra,--all subserve the same end, namely, to make them appear terrible to their enemies.[428] it seems at first a probable conclusion that venomous snakes, such as the foregoing, from being already so well defended by their poison-fangs, would never be attacked by any enemy; and consequently would have no need to excite additional terror. but this is far from being the case, for they are largely preyed on in all quarters of the world by many animals. it is well known that pigs are employed in the united states to clear districts infested with rattle-snakes, which they do most effectually.[429] in england the hedgehog attacks and devours the viper. in india, as i hear from dr. jerdon, several kinds of hawks, and at least one mammal, the herpestes, kill cobras and other venomous species;[430] and so it is in south africa. therefore it is by no means improbable that any sounds or signs by which the venomous species could instantly make themselves recognized as dangerous, would be of more service to them than to the innocuous species which would not be able, if attacked, to inflict any real injury. having said thus much about snakes, i am tempted to add a few remarks on the means by which the rattle of the rattle-snake was probably developed. various animals, including some lizards, either curl or vibrate their tails when excited. this is the case with many kinds of snakes.[431] in the zoological gardens, an innocuous species, the _coronella sayi_, vibrates its tail so rapidly that it becomes almost invisible. the trigonocephalus, before alluded to, has the same habit; and the extremity of its tail is a little enlarged, or ends in a bead. in the lachesis, which is so closely allied to the rattle-snake that it was placed by linnaeus in the same genus, the tail ends in a single, large, lancet-shaped point or scale. with some snakes the skin, as professor shaler remarks, "is more imperfectly detached from the region about the tail than at other parts of the body." now if we suppose that the end of the tail of some ancient american species was enlarged, and was covered by a single large scale, this could hardly have been cast off at the successive moults. in this case it would have been permanently retained, and at each period of growth, as the snake grew larger, a new scale, larger than the last, would have been formed above it, and would likewise have been retained. the foundation for the development of a rattle would thus have been laid; and it would have been habitually used, if the species, like so many others, vibrated its tail whenever it was irritated. that the rattle has since been specially developed to serve as an efficient sound-producing instrument, there can hardly be a doubt; for even the vertebrae included within the extremity of the tail have been altered in shape and cohere. but there is no greater improbability in various structures, such as the rattle of the rattle-snake,--the lateral scales of the echis,--the neck with the included ribs of the cobra,--and the whole body of the puff-adder,--having been modified for the sake of warning and frightening away their enemies, than in a bird, namely, the wonderful secretary-hawk (_gypogeranus_) having had its whole frame modified for the sake of killing snakes with impunity. it is highly probable, judging from what we have before seen, that this bird would ruffle its feathers whenever it attacked a snake; and it is certain that the herpestes, when it eagerly rushes to attack a snake, erects the hair all over its body, and especially that on its tail.[432] we have also seen that some porcupines, when angered or alarmed at the sight of a snake, rapidly vibrate their tails, thus producing a peculiar sound by the striking together of the hollow quills. so that here both the attackers and the attacked endeavour to make themselves as dreadful as possible to each other; and both possess for this purpose specialised means, which, oddly enough, are nearly the same in some of these cases. finally we can see that if, on the one hand, those individual snakes, which were best able to frighten away their enemies, escaped best from being devoured; and if, on the other hand, those individuals of the attacking enemy survived in larger numbers which were the best fitted for the dangerous task of killing and devouring venomous snakes;--then in the one case as in the other, beneficial variations, supposing the characters in question to vary, would commonly have been preserved through the survival of the fittest. _the drawing back and pressure of the ears to the head_.--the ears through their movements are highly expressive in many animals; but in some, such as man, the higher apes, and many ruminants, they fail in this respect. a slight difference in position serves to express in the plainest manner a different state of mind, as we may daily see in the dog; but we are here concerned only with the ears being drawn closely backwards and pressed to the head. a savage frame of mind is thus shown, but only in the case of those animals which fight with their teeth; and the care which they take to prevent their ears being seized by their antagonists, accounts for this position. consequently, through habit and association, whenever they feel slightly savage, or pretend in their play to be savage, their ears are drawn back. that this is the true explanation may be inferred from the relation which exists in very many animals between their manner of fighting and the retraction of their ears. all the carnivora fight with their canine teeth, and all, as far as i have observed, draw their ears back when feeling savage. this may be continually seen with dogs when fighting in earnest, and with puppies fighting in play. the movement is different from the falling down and slight drawing back of the ears, when a dog feels pleased and is caressed by his master. the retraction of the ears may likewise be seen in kittens fighting together in their play, and in full-grown cats when really savage, as before illustrated in fig. 9 (p. 58). although their ears are thus to a large extent protected, yet they often get much torn in old male cats during their mutual battles. the same movement is very striking in tigers, leopards, &c., whilst growling over their food in menageries. the lynx has remarkably long ears; and their retraction, when one of these animals is approached in its cage, is very conspicuous, and is eminently expressive of its savage disposition. even one of the eared seals, the _otariapusilla_, which has very small ears, draws them backwards, when it makes a savage rush at the legs of its keeper. when horses fight together they use their incisors for biting, and their fore-legs for striking, much more than they do their hind-legs for kicking backwards. this has been observed when stallions have broken loose and have fought together, and may likewise be inferred from the kind of wounds which they inflict on each other. every one recognizes the vicious appearance which the drawing back of the ears gives to a horse. this movement is very different from that of listening to a sound behind. if an ill-tempered horse in a stall is inclined to kick backwards, his ears are retracted from habit, though he has no intention or power to bite. but when a horse throws up both hind-legs in play, as when entering an open field, or when just touched by the whip, he does not generally depress his ears, for he does not then feel vicious. guanacoes fight savagely with their teeth; and they must do so frequently, for i found the hides of several which i shot in patagonia deeply scored. so do camels; and both these animals, when savage, draw their ears closely backwards. guanacoes, as i have noticed, when not intending to bite, but merely to spit their offensive saliva from a distance at an intruder, retract their ears. even the hippopotamus, when threatening with its widely-open enormous mouth a comrade, draws back its small ears, just like a horse. now what a contrast is presented between the foregoing animals and cattle, sheep, or goats, which never use their teeth in fighting, and never draw back their ears when enraged! although sheep and goats appear such placid animals, the males often join in furious contests. as deer form a closely related family, and as i did not know that they ever fought with their teeth, i was much surprised at the account given by major ross king of the moose-deer in canada. he says, when "two males chance to meet, laying back their ears and gnashing their teeth together, they rush at each other with appalling fury."[433] but mr. bartlett informs me that some species of deer fight savagely with their teeth, so that the drawing back of the ears by the moose accords with our rule. several kinds of kangaroos, kept in the zoological gardens, fight by scratching with their fore-feet and by kicking with their hind-legs; but they never bite each other, and the keepers have never seen them draw back their ears when angered. rabbits fight chiefly by kicking and scratching, but they likewise bite each other; and i have known one to bite off half the tail of its antagonist. at the commencement of their battles they lay back their ears, but afterwards, as they bound over and kick each other, they keep their ears erect, or move them much about. mr. bartlett watched a wild boar quarrelling rather savagely with his sow; and both had their mouths open and their ears drawn backwards. but this does not appear to be a common action with domestic pigs when quarrelling. boars fight together by striking upwards with their tusks; and mr. bartlett doubts whether they then draw back their ears. elephants, which in like manner fight with their tusks, do not retract their ears, but, on the contrary, erect them when rushing at each other or at an enemy. the rhinoceroses in the zoological gardens fight with their nasal horns, and have never been seen to attempt biting each other except in play; and the keepers are convinced that they do not draw back their ears, like horses and dogs, when feeling savage. the following statement, therefore, by sir s. baker[434] is inexplicable, namely, that a rhinoceros, which he shot in north africa, "had no ears; they had been bitten off close to the head by another of the same species while fighting; and this mutilation is by no means uncommon." lastly, with respect to monkeys. some kinds, which have moveable ears, and which fight with their teeth--for instance the _cereopithecus ruber_--draw back their ears when irritated just like dogs; and they then have a very spiteful appearance. other kinds, as the _inuus ecaudatus_, apparently do not thus act. again, other kinds--and this is a great anomaly in comparison with most other animals--retract their ears, show their teeth, and jabber, when they are pleased by being caressed. i observed this in two or three species of macacus, and in the _cynopithecus niger_. this expression, owing to our familiarity with dogs, would never be recognized as one of joy or pleasure by those unacquainted with monkeys. _erection of the ears_.--this movement requires hardly any notice. all animals which have the power of freely moving their ears, when they are startled, or when they closely observe any object, direct their ears to the point towards which they are looking, in order to hear any sound from this quarter. at the same time they generally raise their heads, as all their organs of sense are there situated, and some of the smaller animals rise on their hind-legs. even those kinds which squat on the ground or instantly flee away to avoid danger, generally act momentarily in this manner, in order to ascertain the source and nature of the danger. the head being raised, with erected ears and eyes directed forwards, gives an unmistakable expression of close attention to any animal. chapter v. -- special expressions of animals. the dog, various expressive movements of--cats--horses--ruminants--monkeys, their expression of joy and affection--of pain--anger--astonishment and terror. _the dog_.--i have already described (figs. 5 and 1) the appearance of a dog approaching another dog with hostile intentions, namely, with erected ears, eyes intently directed forwards, hair on the neck and back bristling, gait remarkably stiff, with the tail upright and rigid. so familiar is this appearance to us, that an angry man is sometimes said "to have his back up." of the above points, the stiff gait and upright tail alone require further discussion. sir c. bell remarks[501] that, when a tiger or wolf is struck by its keeper and is suddenly roused to ferocity, every muscle is in tension, and the limbs are in an attitude of strained exertion, prepared to spring. this tension of the muscles and consequent stiff gait may be accounted for on the principle of associated habit, for anger has continually led to fierce struggles, and consequently to all the muscles of the body having been violently exerted. there is also reason to suspect that the muscular system requires some short preparation, or some degree of innervation, before being brought into strong action. my own sensations lead me to this inference; but i cannot discover that it is a conclusion admitted by physiologists. sir j. paget, however, informs me that when muscles are suddenly contracted with the greatest force, without any preparation, they are liable to be ruptured, as when a man slips unexpectedly; but that this rarely occurs when an action, however violent, is deliberately performed. with respect to the upright position of the tail, it seems to depend (but whether this is really the case i know not) on the elevator muscles being more powerful than the depressors, so that when all the muscles of the hinder part of the body are in a state of tension, the tail is raised. a dog in cheerful spirits, and trotting before his master with high, elastic steps, generally carries his tail aloft, though it is not held nearly so stiffly as when he is angered. a horse when first turned out into an open field, may be seen to trot with long elastic strides, the head and tail being held high aloft. even cows when they frisk about from pleasure, throw up their tails in a ridiculous fashion. so it is with various animals in the zoological gardens. the position of the tail, however, in certain cases, is determined by special circumstances; thus as soon as a horse breaks into a gallop, at full speed, he always lowers his tail, so that as little resistance as possible may be offered to the air. when a dog is on the point of springing on his antagonist, he utters a savage growl; the ears are pressed closely backwards, and the upper lip (fig. 14) is retracted out of the way of his teeth, especially of his canines. these movements may be observed with dogs and puppies in their play. but if a dog gets really savage in his play, his expression immediately changes. this, however, is simply due to the lips and ears being drawn back with much greater energy. if a dog only snarls at another, the lip is generally retracted on one side alone, namely towards his enemy. [illustration: head of snarling dog. fig 14] {illust. caption = fig. 14.--head of snarling dog. from life, by mr. wood. the movements of a dog whilst exhibiting affection towards his master were described (figs. 6 and 8) in our second chapter. these consist in the head and whole body being lowered and thrown into flexuous movements, with the tail extended and wagged from side to side. the ears fall down and are drawn somewhat backwards, which causes the eyelids to be elongated, and alters the whole appearance of the face. the lips hang loosely, and the hair remains smooth. all these movements or gestures are explicable, as i believe, from their standing in complete antithesis to those naturally assumed by a savage dog under a directly opposite state of mind. when a man merely speaks to, or just notices, his dog, we see the last vestige of these movements in a slight wag of the tail, without any other movement of the body, and without even the ears being lowered. dogs also exhibit their affection by desiring to rub against their masters, and to be rubbed or patted by them. gratiolet explains the above gestures of affection in the following manner: and the reader can judge whether the explanation appears satisfactory. speaking of animals in general, including the dog, he says,[502] "c'est toujours la partie la plus sensible de leurs corps qui recherche les caresses ou les donne. lorsque toute la longueur des flancs et du corps est sensible, l'animal serpente et rampe sous les caresses; et ces ondulations se propageant le long des muscles analogues des segments jusqu'aux extremites de la colonne vertebrale, la queue se ploie et s'agite." further on, he adds, that dogs, when feeling affectionate, lower their ears in order to exclude all sounds, so that their whole attention may be concentrated on the caresses of their master! dogs have another and striking way of exhibiting their affection, namely, by licking the hands or faces of their masters. they sometimes lick other dogs, and then it is always their chops. i have also seen dogs licking cats with whom they were friends. this habit probably originated in the females carefully licking their puppies--the dearest object of their love--for the sake of cleansing them. they also often give their puppies, after a short absence, a few cursory licks, apparently from affection. thus the habit will have become associated with the emotion of love, however it may afterwards be aroused. it is now so firmly inherited or innate, that it is transmitted equally to both sexes. a female terrier of mine lately had her puppies destroyed, and though at all times a very affectionate creature, i was much struck with the manner in which she then tried to satisfy her instinctive maternal love by expending it on me; and her desire to lick my hands rose to an insatiable passion. the same principle probably explains why dogs, when feeling affectionate, like rubbing against their masters and being rubbed or patted by them, for from the nursing of their puppies, contact with a beloved object has become firmly associated in their minds with the emotion of love. the feeling of affection of a dog towards his master is combined with a strong sense of submission, which is akin to fear. hence dogs not only lower their bodies and crouch a little as they approach their masters, but sometimes throw themselves on the ground with their bellies upwards. this is a movement as completely opposite as is possible to any show of resistance. i formerly possessed a large dog who was not at all afraid to fight with other dogs; but a wolf-like shepherd-dog in the neighbourhood, though not ferocious and not so powerful as my dog, had a strange influence over him. when they met on the road, my dog used to run to meet him, with his tail partly tucked in between his legs and hair not erected; and then he would throw himself on the ground, belly upwards. by this action he seemed to say more plainly than by words, "behold, i am your slave." a pleasurable and excited state of mind, associated with affection, is exhibited by some dogs in a very peculiar manner, namely, by grinning. this was noticed long ago by somerville, who says, and with a courtly grin, the fawning bound salutes thee cow'ring, his wide op'ning nose upward he curls, and his large sloe-back eyes melt in soft blandishments, and humble joy.' _the chase_, book i. sir w. scott's famous scotch greyhound, maida, had this habit, and it is common with terriers. i have also seen it in a spitz and in a sheep-dog. mr. riviere, who has particularly attended to this expression, informs me that it is rarely displayed in a perfect manner, but is quite common in a lesser degree. the upper lip during the act of grinning is retracted, as in snarling, so that the canines are exposed, and the ears are drawn backwards; but the general appearance of the animal clearly shows that anger is not felt. sir c. bell[503] remarks "dogs, in their expression of fondness, have a slight eversion of the lips, and grin and sniff amidst their gambols, in a way that resembles laughter." some persons speak of the grin as a smile, but if it had been really a smile, we should see a similar, though more pronounced, movement of the lips and ears, when dogs utter their bark of joy; but this is not the case, although a bark of joy often follows a grin. on the other hand, dogs, when playing with their comrades or masters, almost always pretend to bite each other; and they then retract, though not energetically, their lips and ears. hence i suspect that there is a tendency in some dogs, whenever they feel lively pleasure combined with affection, to act through habit and association on the same muscles, as in playfully biting each other, or their masters' hands. i have described, in the second chapter, the gait and appearance of a dog when cheerful, and the marked antithesis presented by the same animal when dejected and disappointed, with his head, ears, body, tail, and chops drooping, and eyes dull. under the expectation of any great pleasure, dogs bound and jump about in an extravagant manner, and bark for joy. the tendency to bark under this state of mind is inherited, or runs in the breed: greyhounds rarely bark, whilst the spitz-dog barks so incessantly on starting for a walk with his master that he becomes a nuisance. an agony of pain is expressed by dogs in nearly the same way as by many other animals, namely, by howling writhing, and contortions of the whole body. attention is shown by the head being raised, with the ears erected, and eyes intently directed towards the object or quarter under observation. if it be a sound and the source is not known, the head is often turned obliquely from side to side in a most significant manner, apparently in order to judge with more exactness from what point the sound proceeds. but i have seen a dog greatly surprised at a new noise, turning, his head to one side through habit, though he clearly perceived the source of the noise. dogs, as formerly remarked, when their attention is in any way aroused, whilst watching some object, or attending to some sound, often lift up one paw (fig. 4) and keep it doubled up, as if to make a slow and stealthy approach. a dog under extreme terror will throw himself down, howl, and void his excretions; but the hair, i believe, does not become erect unless some anger is felt. i have seen a dog much terrified at a band of musicians who were playing loudly outside the house, with every muscle of his body trembling, with his heart palpitating so quickly that the beats could hardly be counted, and panting for breath with widely open mouth, in the same manner as a terrified man does. yet this dog had not exerted himself; he had only wandered slowly and restlessly about the room, and the day was cold. even a very slight degree of fear is invariably shown by the tail being tucked in between the legs. this tucking in of the fail is accompanied by the ears being drawn backwards; but they are not pressed closely to the head,nas in snarling, and they are not lowered, as when a dog is pleased or affectionate. when two young dogs chase each other in play, the one that runs away always keeps his tail tucked inwards. so it is when a dog, in the highest spirits, careers like a mad creature round and round his master in circles, or in figures of eight. he then acts as if another dog were chasing him. this curious kind of play, which must be familiar to every one who has attended to dogs, is particularly apt to be excited, after the animal has been a little startled or frightened, as by his master suddenly jumping out on him in the dusk. in this case, as well as when two young dogs are chasing each other in play, it appears as if the one that runs away was afraid of the other catching him by the tail; but as far as i can find out, dogs very rarely catch each other in this manner. i asked a gentleman, who had kept foxhounds all his life, and be applied to other experienced sportsmen, whether they had ever seen hounds thus seize a fox; but they never had. it appears that when a dog is chased, or when in danger of being struck behind, or of anything falling on him, in all these cases he wishes to withdraw as quickly as possible his whole hind-quarters, and that from some sympathy or connection between the muscles, the tail is then drawn closely inwards. a similarly connected movement between the hind-quarters and the tail may be observed in the hyaena. mr. bartlett informs me that when two of these animals fight together, they are mutually conscious of the wonderful power of each other's jaws, and are extremely cautious. they well know that if one of their legs were seized, the bone would instantly be crushed into atoms; hence they approach each other kneeling, with their legs turned as much as possible inwards, and with their whole bodies bowed, so as not to present any salient point; the tail at the same time being closely tucked in between the legs. in this attitude they approach each other sideways, or even partly backwards. so again with deer, several of the species, when savage and fighting, tuck in their tails. when one horse in a field tries to bite the hind-quarters of another in play, or when a rough boy strikes a donkey from behind, the hind-quarters and the tail are drawn in, though it does not appear as if this were done merely to save the tail from being injured. we have also seen the reverse of these movements; for when an animal trots with high elastic steps, the tail is almost always carried aloft. as i have said, when a dog is chased and runs away, he keeps his ears directed backwards but still open; and this is clearly done for the sake of hearing the footsteps of his pursuer. from habit the ears are often held in this same position, and the tail tucked in, when the danger is obviously in front. i have repeatedly noticed, with a timid terrier of mine, that when she is afraid of some object in front, the nature of which she perfectly knows and does not need to reconnoitre, yet she will for a long time hold her ears and tail in this position, looking the image of discomfort. discomfort, without any fear, is similarly expressed: thus, one day i went out of doors, just at the time when this same dog knew that her dinner would be brought. i did not call her, but she wished much to accompany me, and at the same time she wished much for her dinner; and there she stood, first looking one way and then the other, with her tail tucked in and ears drawn back, presenting an unmistakable appearance of perplexed discomfort. almost all the expressive movements now described, with the exception of the grinning from joy, are innate or instinctive, for they are common to all the individuals, young and old, of all the breeds. most of them are likewise common to the aboriginal parents of the dog, namely the wolf and jackal; and some of them to other species of the same group. tamed wolves and jackals, when caressed by their masters, jump about for joy, wag their tails, lower their ears, lick their master's hands, crouch down, and even throw themselves on the ground belly upwards.[504] i have seen a rather fox-like african jackal, from the gaboon, depress its ears when caressed. wolves and jackals, when frightened, certainly tuck in their tails; and a tamed jackal has been described as careering round his master in circles and figures of eight, like a dog, with his tail between his legs. it has been stated[505] that foxes, however tame, never display any of the above expressive movements; but this is not strictly accurate. many years ago i observed in the zoological gardens, and recorded the fact at the time, that a very tame english fox, when caressed by the keeper, wagged its tail, depressed its ears, and then threw itself on the ground, belly upwards. the black fox of north america likewise depressed its ears in a slight degree. but i believe that foxes never lick the hands of their masters, and i have been assured that when frightened they never tuck in their tails. if the explanation which i have given of the expression of affection in dogs be admitted, then it would appear that animals which have never been domesticated--namely wolves, jackals, and even foxes--have nevertheless acquired, through the principle of antithesis, certain expressive gestures; for it is dot probable that these animals, confined in cages, should have learnt them by imitating dogs. _cats_.--i have already described the actions of a cat (fig. 9), when feeling savage and not terrified. she assumes a crouching attitude and occasionally protrudes her fore-feet, with the claws exserted ready for striking. the tail is extended, being curled or lashed from side to side. the hair is not erected--at least it was not so in the few cases observed by me. the ears are drawn closely backwards and the teeth are shown. low savage growls are uttered. we can understand why the attitude assumed by a cat when preparing to fight with another cat, or in any way greatly irritated, is so widely different from that of a dog approaching another dog with hostile intentions; for the cat uses her fore-feet for striking, and this renders a crouching position convenient or necessary. she is also much more accustomed than a dog to lie concealed and suddenly spring on her prey. no cause can be assigned with certainty for the tail being lashed or curled from side to side. this habit is common to many other animals--for instance, to the puma, when prepared to spring;[506] but it is not common to dogs, or to foxes, as i infer from mr. st. john's account of a fox lying in wait and seizing a hare. we have already seen that some kinds of lizards and various snakes, when excited, rapidly vibrate the tips of their tails. it would appear as if, under strong excitement, there existed an uncontrollable desire for movement of some kind, owing to nerve-force being freely liberated from the excited sensorium; and that as the tail is left free, and as its movement does not disturb the general position of the body, it is curled or lashed about. all the movements of a cat, when feeling affectionate, are in complete antithesis to those just described. she now stands upright, with slightly arched back, tail perpendicularly raised, and ears erected; and she rubs her cheeks and flanks against her master or mistress. the desire to rub something is so strong in cats under this state of mind, that they may often be seen rubbing themselves against the legs of chairs or tables, or against door-posts. this manner of expressing affection probably originated through association, as in the case of dogs, from the mother nursing and fondling her young; and perhaps from the young themselves loving each other and playing together. another and very different gesture, expressive of pleasure, has already been described, namely, the curious manner in which young and even old cats, when pleased, alternately protrude their fore-feet, with separated toes, as if pushing against and sucking their mother's teats. this habit is so far analogous to that of rubbing against something, that both apparently are derived from actions performed during the nursing period. why cats should show affection by rubbing so much more than do dogs, though the latter delight in contact with their masters, and why cats only occasionally lick the hands of their friends, whilst dogs always do so, i cannot say. cats cleanse themselves by licking their own coats more regularly than do dogs. on the other hand, their tongues seem less well fitted for the work than the longer and more flexible tongues of dogs. [illustration: cat terrified at a dog. fig.15] cats, when terrified, stand at full height, and arch their backs in a well-known and ridiculous fashion. they spit, hiss, or growl. the hair over the whole body, and especially on the tail, becomes erect. in the instances observed by me the basal part of the tail was held upright, the terminal part being thrown on one side; but sometimes the tail (see fig. 15) is only a little raised, and is bent almost from the base to one side. the ears are drawn back, and the teeth exposed. when two kittens are playing together, the one often thus tries to frighten the other. from what we have seen in former chapters, all the above points of expression are intelligible, except the extreme arching of the back. i am inclined to believe that, in the same manner as many birds, whilst they ruffle their feathers, spread out their wings and tail, to make themselves look as big as possible, so cats stand upright at their full height, arch their backs, often raise the basal part of the tail, and erect their hair, for the same purpose. the lynx, when attacked, is said to arch its back, and is thus figured by brehm. but the keepers in the zoological gardens have never seen any tendency to this action in the larger feline animals, such as tigers, lions, &c.; and these have little cause to be afraid of any other animal. cats use their voices much as a means of expression, and they utter, under various emotions and desires, at least six or seven different sounds. the purr of satisfaction, which is made during both inspiration and expiration, is one of the most curious. the puma, cheetah, and ocelot likewise purr; but the tiger, when pleased, "emits a peculiar short snuffle, accompanied by the closure of the eyelids."[507] it is said that the lion, jaguar, and leopard, do not purr. _horses_.--horses when savage draw their ears closely back, protrude their heads, and partially uncover their incisor teeth, ready for biting. when inclined to kick behind, they generally, through habit, draw back their ears; and their eyes are turned backwards in a peculiar manner.[508] when pleased, as when some coveted food is brought to them in the stable, they raise and draw in their heads, prick their ears, and looking intently towards their friend, often whinny. impatience is expressed by pawing the ground. the actions of a horse when much startled are highly expressive. one day my horse was much frightened at a drilling machine, covered by a tarpaulin, and lying on an open field. he raised his head so high, that his neck became almost perpendicular; and this he did from habit, for the machine lay on a slope below, and could not have been seen with more distinctness through the raising of the head; nor if any sound had proceeded from it, could the sound have been more distinctly heard. his eyes and ears were directed intently forwards; and i could feel through the saddle the palpitations of his heart. with red dilated nostrils he snorted violently, and whirling round, would have dashed off at full speed, had i not prevented him. the distension of the nostrils is not for the sake of scenting the source of danger, for when a horse smells carefully at any object and is not alarmed, he does not dilate his nostrils. owing to the presence of a valve in the throat, a horse when panting does not breathe through his open mouth, but through his nostrils; and these consequently have become endowed with great powers of expansion. this expansion of the nostrils, as well as the snorting, and the palpitations of the heart, are actions which have become firmly associated during a long series of generations with the emotion of terror; for terror has habitually led the horse to the most violent exertion in dashing away at full speed from the cause of danger. _ruminants_.--cattle and sheep are remarkable from displaying in so slight a degree their emotions or sensations, excepting that of extreme pain. a bull when enraged exhibits his rage only by the manner in which he holds his lowered head, with distended nostrils, and by bellowing. he also often paws the ground; but this pawing seems quite different from that of an impatient horse, for when the soil is loose, he throws up clouds of dust. i believe that bulls act in this manner when irritated by flies, for the sake of driving them away. the wilder breeds of sheep and the chamois when startled stamp on the ground, and whistle through their noses; and this serves as a danger-signal to their comrades. the musk-ox of the arctic regions, when encountered, likewise stamps on the ground.[509] how this stamping action arose i cannot conjecture; for from inquiries which i have made it does not appear that any of these animals fight with their fore-legs. some species of deer, when savage, display far more expression than do cattle, sheep, or goats, for, as has already been stated, they draw back their ears, grind their teeth, erect their hair, squeal, stamp on the ground, and brandish their horns. one day in the zoological gardens, the formosan deer (_cervus pseudaxis_) approached me in a curious attitude, with his muzzle raised high up, so that the horns were pressed back on his neck; the head being held rather obliquely. from the expression of his eye i felt sure that he was savage; he approached slowly, and as soon as he came close to the iron bars, he did not lower his head to butt at me, but suddenly bent it inwards, and struck his horns with great force against the railings. mr. bartlett informs me that some other species of deer place themselves in the same attitude when enraged. _monkeys_.--the various species and genera of monkeys express their feelings in many different ways; and this fact is interesting, as in some degree bearing on the question, whether the so-called races of man should be ranked as distinct species or varieties; for, as we shall see in the following chapters, the different races of man express their emotions and sensations with remarkable uniformity throughout the world. some of the expressive actions of monkeys are interesting in another way, namely from being closely analogous to those of man. as i have had no opportunity of observing any one species of the group under all circumstances, my miscellaneous remarks will be best arranged under different states of the mind. _pleasure, joy, affection_--it is not possible to distinguish in monkeys, at least without more experience than i have had, the expression of pleasure or joy from that of affection. young chimpanzees make a kind of barking noise, when pleased by the return of any one to whom they are attached. when this noise, which the keepers call a laugh, is uttered, the lips are protruded; but so they are under various other emotions. nevertheless i could perceive that when they were pleased the form of the lips differed a little from that assumed when they were angered. if a young chimpanzee be tickled--and the armpits are particularly sensitive to tickling, as in the case of our children,--a more decided chuckling or laughing sound is uttered; though the laughter is sometimes noiseless. the corners of the mouth are then drawn backwards; and this sometimes causes the lower eyelids to be slightly wrinkled. but this wrinkling, which is so characteristic of our own laughter, is more plainly seen in some other monkeys. the teeth in the upper jaw in the chimpanzee are not exposed when they utter their laughing noise, in which respect they differ from us. but their eyes sparkle and grow brighter, as mr. w. l. martin,[510] who has particularly attended to their expression, states. young orangs, when tickled, likewise grin and make a chuckling sound; and mr. martin says that their eyes grow brighter. as soon as their laughter ceases, an expression may be detected passing over their faces, which, as mr. wallace remarked to me, may be called a smile. i have also noticed something of the same kind with the chimpanzee. dr. duchenne--and i cannot quote a better authority--informs me that he kept a very tame monkey in his house for a year; and when he gave it during meal-times some choice delicacy, he observed that the corners of its mouth were slightly raised; thus an expression of satisfaction, partaking of the nature of an incipient smile, and resembling that often seen on the face of main, could be plainly perceived in this animal. the _cebus azarae_,[511] when rejoiced at again seeing a beloved person, utters a peculiar tittering (_kichernden_) sound. it also expresses agreeable sensations, by drawing back the corners of its mouth, without producing any sound. rengger calls this movement laughter, but it would be more appropriately called a smile. the form of the mouth is different when either pain or terror is expressed, and high shrieks are uttered. another species of _cebus_ in the zoological gardens (_c. hypoleucus_) when pleased, makes a reiterated shrill note, and likewise draws back the corners of its mouth, apparently through the contraction of the same muscles as with us. so does the barbary ape (_inuus ecaudatus_) to an extraordinary degree; and i observed in this monkey that the skin of the lower eyelids then became much wrinkled. at the same time it rapidly moved its lower jaw or lips in a spasmodic manner, the teeth being exposed; but the noise produced was hardly more distinct than that which we sometimes call silent laughter. two of the keepers affirmed that this slight sound was the animal's laughter, and when i expressed some doubt on this head (being at the time quite inexperienced), they made it attack or rather threaten a hated entellus monkey, living in the same compartment. instantly the whole expression of the face of the inuus changed; the mouth was opened much more widely, the canine teeth were more fully exposed, and a hoarse barking noise was uttered. the anubis baboon (_cynocephalus anubis_) was first insulted and put into a furious rage, as was easily done, by his keeper, who then made friends with him and shook hands. as the reconciliation was effected the baboon rapidly moved up and down his jaws and lips, and looked pleased. when we laugh heartily, a similar movement, or quiver, may be observed more or less distinctly in our jaws; but with man the muscles of the chest are more particularly acted on, whilst with this baboon, and with some other monkeys, it is the muscles of the jaws and lips which are spasmodically affected. [illustration: cynopithecus niger, in a placid condition. fig.16] [illustration: cynopithecus niger, pleased by being caressed. fig.17] i have already had occasion to remark on the curious manner in which two or three species of alacacus and the _cynopithecus niger_ draw back their ears and utter a slight jabbering noise, when they are pleased by being caressed. with the cynopithecus (fig. 17), the corners of the mouth are at the same time drawn backwards and upwards, so that the teeth are exposed. hence this expression would never be recognized by a stranger as one of pleasure. the crest of long hairs on the forehead is depressed, and apparently the whole skin of the head drawn backwards. the eyebrows are thus raised a little, and the eyes assume a staring appearance. the lower eyelids also become slightly wrinkled; but this wrinkling is not conspicuous, owing to the permanent transverse furrows on the face. _painful emotions and sensations_.--with monkeys the expression of slight pain, or of any painful emotion, such as grief, vexation, jealousy, &c., is not easily distinguished from that of moderate anger; and these states of mind readily and quickly pass into each other. grief, however, with some species is certainly exhibited by weeping. a woman, who sold a monkey to the zoological society, believed to have come from borneo (_macacus maurus_ or _m. inornatus_ of gray), said that it often cried; and mr. bartlett, as well as the keeper mr. sutton, have repeatedly seen it, when grieved, or even when much pitied, weeping so copiously that the tears rolled down its cheeks. there is, however, something strange about this case, for two specimens subsequently kept in the gardens, and believed to be the same species, have never been seen to weep, though they were carefully observed by the keeper and myself when much distressed and loudly screaming. rengger states[512] that the eyes of the _cebus azarae_ fill with tears, but not sufficiently to overflow, when it is prevented getting some much desired object, or is much frightened. humboldt also asserts that the eyes of the _callithrix sciureus_ "instantly fill with tears when it is seized with fear;" but when this pretty little monkey in the zoological gardens was teased, so as to cry out loudly, this did not occur. i do not, however, wish to throw the least doubt on the accuracy of humboldt's statement. the appearance of dejection in young orangs and chimpanzees, when out of health, is as plain and almost as pathetic as in the case of our children. this state of mind and body is shown by their listless movements, fallen countenances, dull eyes, and changed complexion. _anger_.--this emotion is often exhibited by many kinds of monkeys, and is expressed, as mr. martin remarks,[513] in many different ways. "some species, when irritated, pout the lips, gaze with a fixed and savage glare on their foe, and make repeated short starts as if about to spring forward, uttering at the same time inward guttural sounds. many display their anger by suddenly advancing, making abrupt starts, at the same time opening the mouth and pursing up the lips, so as to conceal the teeth, while the eyes are daringly fixed on the enemy, as if in savage defiance. some again, and principally the long-tailed monkeys, or guenons, display their teeth, and accompany their malicious grins with a sharp, abrupt, reiterated cry." mr. sutton confirms the statement that some species uncover their teeth when enraged, whilst others conceal them by the protrusion of their lips; and some kinds draw back their ears. the _cynopithecus niger_, lately referred to, acts in this manner, at the same time depressing the crest of hair on its forehead, and showing its teeth; so that the movements of the features from anger are nearly the same as those from pleasure; and the two expressions can be distinguished only by those familiar with the animal. baboons often show their passion and threaten their enemies in a very odd manner, namely, by opening their mouths widely as in the act of yawning. mr. bartlett has often seen two baboons, when first placed in the same compartment, sitting opposite to each other and thus alternately opening their mouths; and this action seems frequently to end in a real yawn. mr. bartlett believes that both animals wish to show to each other that they are provided with a formidable set of teeth, as is undoubtedly the case. as i could hardly credit the reality of this yawning gesture, mr. bartlett insulted an old baboon and put him into a violent passion; and he almost immediately thus acted. some species of macacus and of cereopithecus[514] behave in the same manner. baboons likewise show their anger, as was observed by brehin with those which he kept alive in abyssinia, in another manner, namely, by striking the ground with one hand, "like an angry man striking the table with his fist." i have seen this movement with the baboons in the zoological gardens; but sometimes the action seems rather to represent the searching for a stone or other object in their beds of straw. mr. sutton has often observed the face of the _macacus rhesus_, when much enraged, growing red. as he was mentioning this to me, another monkey attacked a _rhesus_, and i saw its face redden as plainly as that of a man in a violent passion. in the course of a few minutes, after the battle, the face of this monkey recovered its natural tint. at the same time that the face reddened, the naked posterior part of the body, which is always red, seemed to grow still redder; but i cannot positively assert that this was the case. when the mandrill is in any way excited, the brilliantly coloured, naked parts of the skin are said to become still more vividly coloured. with several species of baboons the ridge of the forehead projects much over the eyes, and is studded with a few long hairs, representing our eyebrows. these animals are always looking about them, and in order to look upwards they raise their eyebrows. they have thus, as it would appear, acquired the habit of frequently moving their eyebrows. however this may be, many kinds of monkeys, especially the baboons, when angered or in any way excited, rapidly and incessantly move their eyebrows up and down, as well as the hairy skin of their foreheads.[515] as we associate in the case of man the raising and lowering of the eyebrows with definite states of the mind, the almost incessant movement of the eyebrows by monkeys gives them a senseless expression. i once observed a man who had a trick of continually raising his eyebrows without any corresponding emotion, and this gave to him a foolish appearance; so it is with some persons who keep the corners of their mouths a little drawn backwards and upwards, as if by an incipient smile, though at the time they are not amused or pleased. a young orang, made jealous by her keeper attending to another monkey, slightly uncovered her teeth, and, uttering a peevish noise like _tish-shist_, turned her back on him. both orangs and chimpanzees, when a little more angered, protrude their lips greatly, and make a harsh barking noise. a young female chimpanzee, in a violent passion, presented a curious resemblance to a child in the same state. she screamed loudly with widely open mouth, the lips being retracted so that the teeth were fully exposed. she threw her arms wildly about, sometimes clasping them over her head. she rolled on the ground, sometimes on her back, sometimes on her belly, and bit everything within reach. a young gibbon (_hylobates syndactylus_) in a passion has been described[516] as behaving in almost exactly the same manner. the lips of young orangs and chimpanzees are protruded, sometimes to a wonderful degree, under various circumstances. they act thus, not only when slightly angered, sulky, or disappointed, but when alarmed at anything--in one instance, at the sight of a turtle,[517]--and likewise when pleased. but neither the degree of protrusion nor the shape of the mouth is exactly the same, as i believe, in all cases; and the sounds which are then uttered are different. the accompanying drawing represents a chimpanzee made sulky by an orange having been offered him, and then taken away. a similar protrusion or pouting of the lips, though to a much slighter degree, may be seen in sulky children. [illustration: chimpanzee disappointed and sulky. fig. 18] many years ago, in the zoological gardens, i placed a looking-glass on the floor before two young orangs, who, as far as it was known, had never before seen one. at first they gazed at their own images with the most steady surprise, and often changed their point of view. they then approached close and protruded their lips towards the image, as if to kiss it, in exactly the same manner as they had previously done towards each other, when first placed, a few days before, in the same room. they next made all sorts of grimaces, and put themselves in various attitudes before the mirror; they pressed and rubbed the surface; they placed their hands at different distances behind it; looked behind it; and finally seemed almost frightened, started a little, became cross, and refused to look any longer. when we try to perform some little action which is difficult and requires precision, for instance, to thread a needle, we generally close our lips firmly, for the sake, i presume, of not disturbing our movements by breathing; and i noticed the same action in a young orang. the poor little creature was sick, and was amusing itself by trying to kill the flies on the window-panes with its knuckles; this was difficult as the flies buzzed about, and at each attempt the lips were firmly compressed, and at the same time slightly protruded. although the countenances, and more especially the gestures, of orangs and chimpanzees are in some respects highly expressive, i doubt whether on the whole they are so expressive as those of some other kinds of monkeys. this may be attributed in part to their ears being immovable, and in part to the nakedness of their eyebrows, of which the movements are thus rendered less conspicuous. when, however, they raise their eyebrows their foreheads become, as with us, transversely wrinkled. in comparison with man, their faces are inexpressive, chiefly owing to their not frowning under any emotion of the mind--that is, as far as i have been able to observe, and i carefully attended to this point. frowning, which is one of the most important of all the expressions in man, is due to the contraction of the corrugators by which the eyebrows are lowered and brought together, so that vertical furrows are formed on the forehead. both the orang and chimpanzee are said[518] to possess this muscle, but it seems rarely brought into action, at least in a conspicuous manner. i made my hands into a sort of cage, and placing some tempting fruit within, allowed both a young orang and chimpanzee to try their utmost to get it out; but although they grew rather cross, they showed not a trace of a frown. nor was there any frown when they were enraged. twice i took two chimpanzees from their rather dark room suddenly into bright sunshine, which would certainly have caused us to frown; they blinked and winked their eyes, but only once did i see a very slight frown. on another occasion, i tickled the nose of a chimpanzee with a straw, and as it crumpled up its face, slight vertical furrows appeared between the eyebrows. i have never seen a frown on the forehead of the orang. the gorilla, when enraged, is described as erecting its crest of hair, throwing down its under lip, dilating its nostrils, and uttering terrific yells. messrs. savage and wyman[519] state that the scalp can be freely moved backwards and forwards, and that when the animal is excited it is strongly contracted; but i presume that they mean by this latter expression that the scalp is lowered; for they likewise speak of the young chimpanzee, when crying out, as having the eyebrows strongly contracted. the great power of movement in the scalp of the gorilla, of many baboons and other monkeys, deserves notice in relation to the power possessed by some few men, either through reversion or persistence, of voluntarily moving their scalps.[520] _astonishment, terror_--a living fresh-water turtle was placed at my request in the same compartment in the zoological gardens with many monkeys; and they showed unbounded astonishment, as well as some fear. this was displayed by their remaining motionless, staring intently with widely opened eyes, their eyebrows being often moved up and down. their faces seemed somewhat lengthened. they occasionally raised themselves on their hind-legs to get abetter view. they often retreated a few feet, and then turning their heads over one shoulder, again stared intently. it was curious to observe how much less afraid they were of the turtle than of a living snake which i had formerly placed in their compartment;[521] for in the course of a few minutes some of the monkeys ventured to approach and touch the turtle. on the other hand, some of the larger baboons were greatly terrified, and grinned as if on the point of screaming out. when i showed a little dressed-up doll to the _cynopithecus niger_, it stood motionless, stared intently with widely opened eyes, and advanced its ears a little forwards. but when the turtle was placed in its compartment, this monkey also moved its lips in an odd, rapid, jabbering manner, which the keeper declared was meant to conciliate or please the turtle. i was never able clearly to perceive that the eyebrows of astonished monkeys were kept permanently raised, though they were frequently moved up and down. attention, which precedes astonishment, is expressed by man by a slight raising of the eyebrows; and dr. duchenne informs me that when he gave to the monkey formerly mentioned some quite new article of food, it elevated its eyebrows a little, thus assuming an appearance of close attention. it then took the food in its fingers, and, with lowered or rectilinear eyebrows, scratched, smelt, and examined it,--an expression of reflection being thus exhibited. sometimes it would throw back its head a little, and again with suddenly raised eyebrows re-examine and finally taste the food. in no case did any monkey keep its mouth open when it was astonished. mr. sutton observed for me a young orang and chimpanzee during a considerable length of time; and however much they were astonished, or whilst listening intently to some strange sound, they did not keep their mouths open. this fact is surprising, as with mankind hardly any expression is more general than a widely open mouth under the sense of astonishment. as far as i have been able to observe, monkeys breathe more freely through their nostrils than men do; and this may account for their not opening their mouths when they are astonished; for, as we shall see in a future chapter, man apparently acts in this manner when startled, at first for the sake of quickly drawing a full inspiration, and afterwards for the sake of breathing as quietly as possible. terror is expressed by many kinds of monkeys by the utterance of shrill screams; the lips being drawn back, so that the teeth are exposed. the hair becomes erect, especially when some anger is likewise felt. mr. sutton has distinctly seen the face of the _macacus rhesus_ grow pale from fear. monkeys also tremble from fear; and sometimes they void their excretions. i have seen one which, when caught, almost fainted from an excess of terror. sufficient facts have now been given with respect to the expressions of various animals. it is impossible to agree with sir c. bell when he says[522] that "the faces of animals seem chiefly capable of expressing rage and fear;" and again, when he says that all their expressions "may be referred, more or less plainly, to their acts of volition or necessary instincts." he who will look at a dog preparing to attack another dog or a man, and at the same animal when caressing his master, or will watch the countenance of a monkey when insulted, and when fondled by his keeper, will be forced to admit that the movements of their features and their gestures are almost as expressive as those of man. although no explanation can be given of some of the expressions in the lower animals, the greater number are explicable in accordance with the three principles given at the commencement of the first chapter. chapter vi. -- special expressions of man: suffering and weeping. the screaming and weeping of infants--forms of features--age at which weeping commences--the effects of habitual restraint on weeping--sobbing--cause of the contraction of the muscles round the eyes during screaming--cause of the secretion of tears. in this and the following chapters the expressions exhibited by man under various states of the mind will be described and explained, as far as lies in my power. my observations will be arranged according to the order which i have found the most convenient; and this will generally lead to opposite emotions and sensations succeeding each other. _suffering of the body and mind: weeping_.--i have already described in sufficient detail, in the third chapter, the signs of extreme pain, as shown by screams or groans, with the writhing of the whole body and the teeth clenched or ground together. these signs are often accompanied or followed by profuse sweating, pallor, trembling, utter prostration, or faintness. no suffering is greater than that from extreme fear or horror, but here a distinct emotion comes into play, and will be elsewhere considered. prolonged suffering, especially of the mind, passes into low spirits, grief, dejection, and despair, and these states will be the subject of the following chapter. here i shall almost confine myself to weeping or crying, more especially in children. infants, when suffering even slight pain, moderate hunger, or discomfort, utter violent and prolonged screams. whilst thus screaming their eyes are firmly closed, so that the skin round them is wrinkled, and the forehead contracted into a frown. the mouth is widely opened with the lips retracted in a peculiar manner, which causes it to assume a squarish form; the gums or teeth being more or less exposed. the breath is inhaled almost spasmodically. it is easy to observe infants whilst screaming; but i have found photographs made by the instantaneous process the best means for observation, as allowing more deliberation. i have collected twelve, most of them made purposely for me; and they all exhibit the same general characteristics. i have, therefore, had six of them[601] (plate i.) reproduced by the heliotype process. [illustration: screaming infants. plate i. ] the firm closing of the eyelids and consequent compression of the eyeball,--and this is a most important element in various expressions,--serves to protect the eyes from becoming too much gorged with blood, as will presently be explained in detail. with respect to the order in which the several muscles contract in firmly compressing the eyes, i am indebted to dr. langstaff, of southampton, for some observations, which i have since repeated. the best plan for observing the order is to make a person first raise his eyebrows, and this produces transverse wrinkles across the forehead; and then very gradually to contract all the muscles round the elves with as much force as possible. the reader who is unacquainted with the anatomy of the face, ought to refer to p. 24, and look at the woodcuts 1 to 3. the corrugators of the brow (_corrugator supercilii_) seem to be the first muscles to contract; and these draw the eyebrows downwards and inwards towards the base of the nose, causing vertical furrows, that is a frown, to appear between the eyebrows; at the same time they cause the disappearance of the transverse wrinkles across the forehead. the orbicular muscles contract almost simultaneously with the corrugators, and produce wrinkles all round the eyes; they appear, however, to be enabled to contract with greater force, as soon as the contraction of the corrugators has given them some support. lastly, the pyramidal muscles of the nose contract; and these draw the eyebrows and the skin of the forehead still lower down, producing short transverse wrinkles across the base of the nose.[602] for the sake of brevity these muscles will generally be spoken of as the orbiculars, or as those surrounding the eyes. when these muscles are strongly contracted, those running to the upper lip[603] likewise contract and raise the upper lip. this might have been expected from the manner in which at least one of them, the _malaris_, is connected with the orbiculars. any one who will gradually contract the muscles round his eyes, will feel, as he increases the force, that his upper lip and the wings of his nose (which are partly acted on by one of the same muscles) are almost always a little drawn up. if he keeps his mouth firmly shut whilst contracting the muscles round the eyes, and then suddenly relaxes his lips, he will feel that the pressure on his eyes immediately increases. so again when a person on a bright, glaring day wishes to look at a distant object, but is compelled partially to close his eyelids, the upper lip may almost always be observed to be somewhat raised. the mouths of some very short-sighted persons, who are forced habitually to reduce the aperture of their eyes, wear from this same reason a grinning expression. the raising of the upper lip draws upwards the flesh of the upper parts of the cheeks, and produces a strongly marked fold on each cheek,--the naso-labial fold,--which runs from near the wings of the nostrils to the corners of the mouth and below them. this fold or furrow may be seen in all the photographs, and is very characteristic of the expression of a crying child; though a nearly similar fold is produced in the act of laughing or smiling.[604] as the upper lip is much drawn up during the act of screaming, in the manner just explained, the depressor muscles of the angles of the mouth (see k in woodcuts 1 and 2) are strongly contracted in order to keep the mouth widely open, so that a full volume of sound may be poured forth. the action of these opposed muscles, above and below, tends to give to the mouth an oblong, almost squarish outline, as may be seen in the accompanying photographs. an excellent observer,[605] in describing a baby crying whilst being fed, says, "it made its mouth like a square, and let the porridge run out at all four corners." i believe, but we shall return to this point in a future chapter, that the depressor muscles of the angles of the mouth are less under the separate control of the will than the adjoining muscles; so that if a young child is only doubtfully inclined to cry, this muscle is generally the first to contract, and is the last to cease contracting. when older children commence crying, the muscles which run to the upper lip are often the first to contract; and this may perhaps be due to older children not having so strong a tendency to scream loudly, and consequently to keep their mouths widely open; so that the above-named depressor muscles are not brought into such strong action. with one of my own infants, from his eighth day and for some time afterwards, i often observed that the first sign of a screaming-fit, when it could be observed coming on gradually, was a little frown, owing to the contraction of the corrugators of the brows; the capillaries of the naked head and face becoming at the same time reddened with blood. as soon as the screaming-fit actually began, all the muscles round the eyes were strongly contracted, and the mouth widely opened in the manlier above described; so that at this early period the features assumed the same form as at a more advanced age. dr. piderit[606] lays great stress on the contraction of certain muscles which draw down the nose and narrow the nostrils, as eminently characteristic of a crying expression. the _depressores anguli oris_, as we have just seen, are usually contracted at the same time, and they indirectly tend, according to dr. duchenne, to act in this same manner on the nose. with children having bad colds a similar pinched appearance of the nose may be noticed, which is at least partly due, as remarked to me by dr. langstaff, to their constant snuffling, and the consequent pressure of the atmosphere on the two sides. the purpose of this contraction of the nostrils by children having bad colds, or whilst crying, seems to be to cheek the downward flow of the mucus and tears, and to prevent these fluids spreading over the upper lip. after a prolonged and severe screaming-fit, the scalp, face, and eyes are reddened, owing to the return of the blood from the head having been impeded by the violent expiratory efforts; but the redness of the stimulated eyes is chiefly due to the copious effusion of tears. the various muscles of the face which have been strongly contracted, still twitch a little, and the upper lip is still slightly drawn up or everted,[607] with the corners of the mouth still a little drawn downwards. i have myself felt, and have observed in other grown-up persons, that when tears are restrained with difficulty, as in reading a pathetic story, it is almost impossible to prevent the various muscles. which with young children are brought into strong action during their screaming-fits, from slightly twitching or trembling. infants whilst young do not shed tears or weep, as is well known to nurses and medical men. this circumstance is not exclusively due to the lacrymal glands being as yet incapable of secreting tears. i first noticed this fact from having accidentally brushed with the cuff of my coat the open eye of one of my infants, when seventy-seven days old, causing this eye to water freely; and though the child screamed violently, the other eye remained dry, or was only slightly suffused with tears. a similar slight effusion occurred ten days previously in both eyes during a screaming-fit. the tears did not run over the eyelids and roll down the cheeks of this child, whilst screaming badly, when 122 days old. this first happened 17 days later, at the age of 139 days. a few other children have been observed for me, and the period of free weeping appears to be very variable. in one case, the eyes became slightly suffused at the age of only 20 days; in another, at 62 days. with two other children, the tears did not run down the face at the ages of 84 and 110 days; but in a third child they did run down at the age of 104 days. in one instance, as i was positively assured, tears ran down at the unusually early age of 42 days. it would appear as if the lacrymal glands required some practice in the individual before they are easily excited into action, in somewhat the same manner as various inherited consensual movements and tastes require some exercise before they are fixed and perfected. this is all the more likely with a habit like weeping, which must have been acquired since the period when man branched off from the common progenitor of the genus homo and of the non-weeping anthropomorphous apes. the fact of tears not being shed at a very early age from pain or any mental emotion is remarkable, as, later in life, no expression is more general or more strongly marked than weeping. when the habit has once been acquired by an infant, it expresses in the clearest manner suffering of all kinds, both bodily pain and mental distress, even though accompanied by other emotions, such as fear or rage. the character of the crying, however, changes at a very early age, as i noticed in my own infants,--the passionate cry differing from that of grief. a lady informs me that her child, nine months old, when in a passion screams loudly, but does not weep; tears, however, are shed when she is punished by her chair being turned with its back to the table. this difference may perhaps be attributed to weeping being restrained, as we shall immediately see, at a more advanced age, under most circumstances excepting grief; and to the influence of such restraint being transmitted to an earlier period of life, than that at which it was first practised. with adults, especially of the male sex, weeping soon ceases to be caused by, or to express, bodily pain. this may be accounted for by its being thought weak and unmanly by men, both of civilized and barbarous races, to exhibit bodily pain by any outward sign. with this exception, savages weep copiously from very slight causes, of which fact sir j. lubbock[608] has collected instances. a new zealand chief "cried like a child because the sailors spoilt his favourite cloak by powdering it with flour." i saw in tierra del fuego a native who had lately lost a brother, and who alternately cried with hysterical violence, and laughed heartily at anything which amused him. with the civilized nations of europe there is also much difference in the frequency of weeping. englishmen rarely cry, except under the pressure of the acutest grief; whereas in some parts of the continent the men shed tears much more readily and freely. the insane notoriously give way to all their emotions with little or no restraint; and i am informed by dr. j. crichton browne, that nothing is more characteristic of simple melancholia, even in the male sex, than a tendency to weep on the slightest occasions, or from no cause. they also weep disproportionately on the occurrence of any real cause of grief. the length of time during which some patients weep is astonishing, as well as the amount of tears which they shed. one melancholic girl wept for a whole day, and afterwards confessed to dr. browne, that it was because she remembered that she had once shaved off her eyebrows to promote their growth. many patients in the asylum sit for a long time rocking themselves backwards and forwards; "and if spoken to, they stop their movements, purse up their eyes, depress the corners of the mouth, and burst out crying." in some of these cases, the being spoken to or kindly greeted appears to suggest some fanciful and sorrowful notion; but in other cases an effort of any kind excites weeping, independently of any sorrowful idea. patients suffering from acute mania likewise have paroxysms of violent crying or blubbering, in the midst of their incoherent ravings. we must not, however, lay too much stress on the copious shedding of tears by the insane, as being due to the lack of all restraint; for certain brain-diseases, as hemiplegia, brain-wasting, and senile decay, have a special tendency to induce weeping. weeping is common in the insane, even after a complete state of fatuity has been reached and the power of speech lost. persons born idiotic likewise weep;[609] but it is said that this is not the case with cretins. weeping seems to be the primary and natural expression, as we see in children, of suffering of any kind, whether bodily pain short of extreme agony, or mental distress. but the foregoing facts and common experience show us that a frequently repeated effort to restrain weeping, in association with certain states of the mind, does much in checking the habit. on the other hand, it appears that the power of weeping can be increased through habit; thus the rev. r. taylor,[610] who long resided in new zealand, asserts that the women can voluntarily shed tears in abundance; they meet for this purpose to mourn for the dead, and they take pride in crying "in the most affecting manner." a single effort of repression brought to bear on the lacrymal glands does little, and indeed seems often to lead to an opposite result. an old and experienced physician told me that he had always found that the only means to check the occasional bitter weeping of ladies who consulted him, and who themselves wished to desist, was earnestly to beg them not to try, and to assure them that nothing would relieve them so much as prolonged and copious crying. the screaming of infants consists of prolonged expirations, with short and rapid, almost spasmodic inspirations, followed at a somewhat more advanced age by sobbing. according to gratiolet,[611] the glottis is chiefly affected during the act of sobbing. this sound is heard "at the moment when the inspiration conquers the resistance of the glottis, and the air rushes into the chest." but the whole act of respiration is likewise spasmodic and violent. the shoulders are at the same time generally raised, as by this movement respiration is rendered easier. with one of my infants, when seventy-seven days old, the inspirations were so rapid and strong that they approached in character to sobbing; when 138 days old i first noticed distinct sobbing, which subsequently followed every bad crying-fit. the respiratory movements are partly voluntary and partly involuntary, and i apprehend that sobbing is at least in part due to children having some power to command after early infancy their vocal organs and to stop their screams, but from having less power over their respiratory muscles, these continue for a time to act in an involuntary or spasmodic manner, after having been brought into violent action. sobbing seems to be peculiar to the human species; for the keepers in the zoological gardens assure me that they have never heard a sob from any kind of monkey; though monkeys often scream loudly whilst being chased and caught, and then pant for a long time. we thus see that there is a close analogy between sobbing and the free shedding of tears; for with children, sobbing does not commence during early infancy, but afterwards comes on rather suddenly and then follows every bad crying-fit, until the habit is checked with advancing years. _on the cause of the contraction of the muscles round the eyes during screaming_.--we have seen that infants and young children, whilst screaming, invariably close their eyes firmly, by the contraction of the surrounding muscles, so that the skin becomes wrinkled all around. with older children, and even with adults, whenever there is violent and unrestrained crying, a tendency to the contraction of these same muscles may be observed; though this is often checked in order not to interfere with vision. sir c. bell explains[612] this action in the following manner:--"during every violent act of expiration, whether in hearty laughter, weeping, coughing, or sneezing, the eyeball is firmly compressed by the fibres of the orbicularis; and this is a provision for supporting and defending the vascular system of the interior of the eye from a retrograde impulse communicated to the blood in the veins at that time. when we contract the chest and expel the air, there is a retardation of the blood in the veins of the neck and head; and in the more powerful acts of expulsion, the blood not only distends the vessels, but is even regurgitated into the minute branches. were the eye not properly compressed at that time, and a resistance given to the shock, irreparable injury might be inflicted on the delicate textures of the interior of the eye." he further adds, "if we separate the eyelids of a child to examine the eye, while it cries and struggles with passion, by taking off the natural support to the vascular system of the eye, and means of guarding it against the rush of blood then occurring, the conjunctiva becomes suddenly filled with blood, and the eyelids everted." not only are the muscles round the eyes strongly contracted, as sir c. bell states and as i have often observed, during screaming, loud laughter, coughing, and sneezing, but during several other analogous actions. a man contracts these muscles when he violently blows his nose. i asked one of my boys to shout as loudly as he possibly could, and as soon as he began, he firmly contracted his orbicular muscles; i observed this repeatedly, and on asking him why he had every time so firmly closed his eyes, i found that he was quite unaware of the fact: he had acted instinctively or unconsciously. it is not necessary, in order to lead to the contraction of these muscles, that air should actually be expelled from the chest; it suffices that the muscles of the chest and abdomen should contract with great force, whilst by the closure of the glottis no air escapes. in violent vomiting or retching the diaphragm is made to descend by the chest being filled with air; it is then held in this position by the closure of the glottis, "as well as by the contraction of its own fibres."[613] the abdominal muscles now contract strongly upon the stomach, its proper muscles likewise contracting, and the contents are thus ejected. during each effort of vomiting "the head becomes greatly congested, so that the features are red and swollen, and the large veins of the face and temples visibly dilated." at the same time, as i know from observation, the muscles round the eyes are strongly contracted. this is likewise the case when the abdominal muscles act downwards with unusual force in expelling the contents of the intestinal canal. the greatest exertion of the muscles of the body, if those of the chest are not brought into strong action in expelling or compressing the air within the lungs, does not lead to the contraction of the muscles round the eyes. i have observed my sons using great force in gymnastic exercises, as in repeatedly raising their suspended bodies by their arms alone, and in lifting heavy weights from the ground, but there was hardly any trace of contraction in the muscles round the eyes. as the contraction of these muscles for the protection of the eyes during violent expiration is indirectly, as we shall hereafter see, a fundamental element in several of our most important expressions, i was extremely anxious to ascertain how far sir c. bell's view could be substantiated. professor donders, of utrecht,[614] well known as one of the highest authorities in europe on vision and on the structure of the eye, has most kindly undertaken for me this investigation with the aid of the many ingenious mechanisms of modern science, and has published the results.[615] he shows that during violent expiration the external, the intra-ocular, and the retro-ocular vessels of the eye are all affected in two ways, namely by the increased pressure of the blood in the arteries, and by the return of the blood in the veins being impeded. it is, therefore, certain that both the arteries and the veins of the eye are more or less distended during violent expiration. the evidence in detail may be found in professor donders' valuable memoir. we see the effects on the veins of the head, in their prominence, and in the purple colour of the face of a man who coughs violently from being half choked. i may mention, on the same authority, that the whole eye certainly advances a little during each violent expiration. this is due to the dilatation of the retro-ocular vessels, and might have been expected from the intimate connection of the eye and brain; the brain being known to rise and fall with each respiration, when a portion of the skull has been removed; and as may be seen along the unclosed sutures of infants' heads. this also, i presume, is the reason that the eyes of a strangled man appear as if they were starting from their sockets. with respect to the protection of the eye during violent expiratory efforts by the pressure of the eyelids, professor donders concludes from his various observations that this action certainly limits or entirely removes the dilatation of the vessels.[616] at such times, he adds, we not unfrequently see the hand involuntarily laid upon the eyelids, as if the better to support and defend the eyeball. nevertheless much evidence cannot at present be advanced to prove that the eye actually suffers injury from the want of support during violent expiration; but there is some. it is "a fact that forcible expiratory efforts in violent coughing or vomiting, and especially in sneezing, sometimes give rise to ruptures of the little (external) vessels" of the eye.[617] with respect to the internal vessels, dr. gunning has lately recorded a case of exophthalmos in consequence of whooping-cough, which in his opinion depended on the rupture of the deeper vessels; and another analogous case has been recorded. but a mere sense of discomfort would probably suffice to lead to the associated habit of protecting the eyeball by the contraction of the surrounding muscles. even the expectation or chance of injury would probably be sufficient, in the same manner as an object moving too near the eye induces involuntary winking of the eyelids. we may, therefore, safely conclude from sir c. bell's observations, and more especially from the more careful investigations by professor donders, that the firm closure of the eyelids during the screaming of children is an action full of meaning and of real service. we have already seen that the contraction of the orbicular muscles leads to the drawing up of the upper lip, and consequently, if the mouth is kept widely open, to the drawing down of the corners by the contraction of the depressor muscles. the formation of the naso-labial fold on the cheeks likewise follows from the drawing up of the upper lip. thus all the chief expressive movements of the face during crying apparently result from the contraction of the muscles round the eyes. we shall also find that the shedding of tears depends on, or at least stands in some connection with, the contraction of these same muscles. in some of the foregoing cases, especially in those of sneezing and coughing, it is possible that the contraction of the orbicular muscles may serve in addition to protect the eyes from too severe a jar or vibration. i think so, because dogs and cats, in crunching hard bones, always close their eyelids, and at least sometimes in sneezing; though dogs do not do so whilst barking loudly. mr. sutton carefully observed for me a young orang and chimpanzee, and he found that both always closed their eyes in sneezing and coughing, but not whilst screaming violently. i gave a small pinch of snuff to a monkey of the american division, namely, a cebus, and it closed its eyelids whilst sneezing; but not on a subsequent occasion whilst uttering loud cries. _cause of the secretion of tears_.--it is an important fact which must be considered in any theory of the secretion of tears from the mind being affected, that whenever the muscles round the eyes are strongly and involuntarily contracted in order to compress the blood-vessels and thus to protect the eyes, tears are secreted, often in sufficient abundance to roll down the cheeks. this occurs under the most opposite emotions, and under no emotion at all. the sole exception, and this is only a partial one, to the existence of a relation between the involuntary and strong contraction of these muscles and the secretion of tears is that of young infants, who, whilst screaming violently with their eyelids firmly closed, do not commonly weep until they have attained the age of from two to three or four months. their eyes, however, become suffused with tears at a much earlier age. it would appear, as already remarked, that the lacrymal glands do not, from the want of practice or some other cause, come to full functional activity at a very early period of life. with children at a somewhat later age, crying out or wailing from any distress is so regularly accompanied by the shedding of tears, that weeping and crying are synonymous terms.[618] under the opposite emotion of great joy or amusement, as long as laughter is moderate there is hardly any contraction of the muscles round the eyes, so that there is no frowning; but when peals of loud laughter are uttered, with rapid and violent spasmodic expirations, tears stream down the face. i have more than once noticed the face of a person, after a paroxysm of violent laughter, and i could see that the orbicular muscles and those running to the upper lip were still partially contracted, which together with the tear-stained cheeks gave to the upper half of the face an expression not to be distinguished from that of a child still blubbering from grief. the fact of tears streaming down the face during violent laughter is common to all the races of mankind, as we shall see in a future chapter. in violent coughing especially when a person is half-choked, the face becomes purple, the veins distended, the orbicular muscles strongly contracted, and tears run down the cheeks. even after a fit of ordinary coughing, almost every one has to wipe his eyes. in violent vomiting or retching, as i have myself experienced and seen in others, the orbicular muscles are strongly contracted, and tears sometimes flow freely down the cheeks. it has been suggested to me that this may be due to irritating matter being injected into the nostrils, and causing by reflex action the secretion of tears. accordingly i asked one of my informants, a surgeon, to attend to the effects of retching when nothing was thrown up from the stomach; and, by an odd coincidence, he himself suffered the next morning from an attack of retching, and three days subsequently observed a lady under a similar attack; and he is certain that in neither case an atom of matter was ejected from the stomach; yet the orbicular muscles were strongly contracted, and tears freely secreted. i can also speak positively to the energetic contraction of these same muscles round the eyes, and to the coincident free secretion of tears, when the abdominal muscles act with unusual force in a downward direction on the intestinal canal. yawning commences with a deep inspiration, followed by a long and forcible expiration; and at the same time almost all the muscles of the body are strongly contracted, including those round the eyes. during this act tears are often secreted, and i have seen them even rolling down the cheeks. i have frequently observed that when persons scratch some point which itches intolerably, they forcibly close their eyelids; but they do not, as i believe, first draw a deep breath and then expel it with force; and i have never noticed that the eyes then become filled with tears; but i am not prepared to assert that this does not occur. the forcible closure of the eyelids is, perhaps, merely a part of that general action by which almost all the muscles of the body are at the same time rendered rigid. it is quite different from the gentle closure of the eyes which often accompanies, as gratiolet remarks,[619] the smelling a delicious odour, or the tasting a delicious morsel, and which probably originates in the desire to shut out any disturbing impression through the eyes. professor donders writes to me to the following effect: "i have observed some cases of a very curious affection when, after a slight rub (_attouchement_), for example, from the friction of a coat, which caused neither a wound nor a contusion, spasms of the orbicular muscles occurred, with a very profuse flow of tears, lasting about one hour. subsequently, sometimes after an interval of several weeks, violent spasms of the same muscles re-occurred, accompanied by the secretion of tears, together with primary or secondary redness of the eye." mr. bowman informs me that he has occasionally observed closely analogous cases, and that, in some of these, there was no redness or inflammation of the eyes. i was anxious to ascertain whether there existed in any of the lower animals a similar relation between the contraction of the orbicular muscles during violent expiration and the secretion of tears; but there are very few animals which contract these muscles in a prolonged manner, or which shed tears. _the macacus maurus_, which formerly wept so copiously in the zoological gardens, would have been a fine case for observation; but the two monkeys now there, and which are believed to belong to the same species, do not weep. nevertheless they were carefully observed by mr. bartlett and myself, whilst screaming loudly, and they seemed to contract these muscles; but they moved about their cages so rapidly, that it was difficult to observe with certainty. no other monkey, as far as i have been able to ascertain, contracts its orbicular muscles whilst screaming. the indian elephant is known sometimes to weep. sir e. tennent, in describing these which he saw captured and bound in ceylon, says, some "lay motionless on the ground, with no other indication of suffering than the tears which suffused their eyes and flowed incessantly." speaking of another elephant he says, "when overpowered and made fast, his grief was most affecting; his violence sank to utter prostration, and he lay on the ground, uttering choking cries, with tears trickling down his cheeks."[620] in the zoological gardens the keeper of the indian elephants positively asserts that he has several times seen tears rolling down the face of the old female, when distressed by the removal of the young one. hence i was extremely anxious to ascertain, as an extension of the relation between the contraction of the orbicular muscles and the shedding of tears in man, whether elephants when screaming or trumpeting loudly contract these muscles. at mr. bartlett's desire the keeper ordered the old and the young elephant to trumpet; and we repeatedly saw in both animals that, just as the trumpeting began, the orbicular muscles, especially the lower ones, were distinctly contracted. on a subsequent occasion the keeper made the old elephant trumpet much more loudly, and invariably both the upper and lower orbicular muscles were strongly contracted, and now in an equal degree. it is a singular fact that the african elephant, which, however, is so different from the indian species that it is placed by some naturalists in a distinct sub-genus, when made on two occasions to trumpet loudly, exhibited no trace of the contraction of the orbicular muscles. from the several foregoing cases with respect to man, there can, i think, be no doubt that the contraction of the muscles round the eyes, during violent expiration or when the expanded chest is forcibly compressed, is, in some manner, intimately connected with the secretion of tears. this holds good under widely different emotions, and independently of any emotion. it is not, of course, meant that tears cannot be secreted without the contraction of these muscles; for it is notorious that they are often freely shed with the eyelids not closed, and with the brows unwrinkled. the contraction must be both involuntary and prolonged, as during a choking fit, or energetic, as during a sneeze. the mere involuntary winking of the eyelids, though often repeated, does not bring tears into the eyes. nor does the voluntary and prolonged contraction of the several surrounding muscles suffice. as the lacrymal glands of children are easily excited, i persuaded my own and several other children of different ages to contract these muscles repeatedly with their utmost force, and to continue doing so as long as they possibly could; but this produced hardly any effect. there was sometimes a little moisture in the eyes, but not more than apparently could be accounted for by the squeezing out of the already secreted tears within the glands. the nature of the relation between the involuntary and energetic contraction of the muscles round the eyes, and the secretion of tears, cannot be positively ascertained, but a probable view may be suggested. the primary function of the secretion of tears, together with some mucus, is to lubricate the surface of the eye; and a secondary one, as some believe, is to keep the nostrils damp, so that the inhaled air may be moist,[621] and likewise to favour the power of smelling. but another, and at least equally important function of tears, is to wash out particles of dust or other minute objects which may get into the eyes. that this is of great importance is clear from the cases in which the cornea has been rendered opaque through inflammation, caused by particles of dust not being removed, in consequence of the eye and eyelid becoming immovable.[622] the secretion of tears from the irritation of any foreign body in the eye is a reflex action;--that is, the body irritates a peripheral nerve which sends an impression to certain sensory nerve-cells; these transmit an influence to other cells, and these again to the lacrymal glands. the influence transmitted to these glands causes, as there is good reason to believe, the relaxation of the muscular coats of the smaller arteries; this allows more blood to permeate the glandular tissue, and this induces a free secretion of tears. when the small arteries of the face, including those of the retina, are relaxed under very different circumstances, namely, during an intense blush, the lacrymal glands are sometimes affected in a like manner, for the eyes become suffused with tears. it is difficult to conjecture how many reflex actions have originated, but, in relation to the present case of the affection of the lacrymal glands through irritation of the surface of the eye, it may be worth remarking that, as soon as some primordial form became semi-terrestrial in its habits, and was liable to get particles of dust into its eyes, if these were not washed out they would cause much irritation; and on the principle of the radiation of nerve-force to adjoining nerve-cells, the lacrymal glands would be stimulated to secretion. as this would often recur, and as nerve-force readily passes along accustomed channels, a slight irritation would ultimately suffice to cause a free secretion of tears. as soon as by this, or by some other means, a reflex action of this nature had been established and rendered easy, other stimulants applied to the surface of the eye--such as a cold wind, slow inflammatory action, or a blow on the eyelids--would cause a copious secretion of tears, as we know to be the case. the glands are also excited into action through the irritation of adjoining parts. thus when the nostrils are irritated by pungent vapours, though the eyelids may be kept firmly closed, tears are copiously secreted; and this likewise follows from a blow on the nose, for instance from a boxing-glove. a stinging switch on the face produces, as i have seen, the same effect. in these latter cases the secretion of tears is an incidental result, and of no direct service. as all these parts of the face, including the lacrymal glands, are supplied with branches of the same nerve, namely, the fifth, it is in some degree intelligible that the effects of the excitement of any one branch should spread to the nerve-cells or roots of the other branches. the internal parts of the eye likewise act, under certain conditions, in a reflex manner on the lacrymal glands. the following statements have been kindly communicated to me by mr. bowman; but the subject is a very intricate one, as all the parts of the eye are so intimately related together, and are so sensitive to various stimulants. a strong light acting on the retina, when in a normal condition, has very little tendency to cause lacrymation; but with unhealthy children having small, old-standing ulcers on the cornea, the retina becomes excessively sensitive to light, and exposure even to common daylight causes forcible and sustained closure of the lids, and a profuse flow of tears. when persons who ought to begin the use of convex glasses habitually strain the waning power of accommodation, an undue secretion of tears very often follows, and the retina is liable to become unduly sensitive to light. in general, morbid affections of the surface of the eye, and of the ciliary structures concerned in the accommodative act, are prone to be accompanied with excessive secretion of tears. hardness of the eyeball, not rising to inflammation, but implying a want of balance between the fluids poured out and again taken up by the intra-ocular vessels, is not usually attended with any lacrymation. when the balance is on the other side, and the eye becomes too soft, there is a greater tendency to lacrymation. finally, there are numerous morbid states and structural alterations of the eyes, and even terrible inflammations, which may be attended with little or no secretion of tears. it also deserves notice, as indirectly bearing on our subject, that the eye and adjoining parts are subject to an extraordinary number of reflex and associated movements, sensations, and actions, besides those relating to the lacrymal glands. when a bright light strikes the retina of one eye alone, the iris contracts, but the iris of the other eye moves after a measurable interval of time. the iris likewise moves in accommodation to near or distant vision, and when the two eyes are made to converge.[623] every one knows how irresistibly the eyebrows are drawn down under an intensely bright light. the eyelids also involuntarily wink when an object is moved near the eyes, or a sound is suddenly heard. the well-known case of a bright light causing some persons to sneeze is even more curious; for nerve-force here radiates from certain nerve-cells in connection with the retina, to the sensory nerve-cells of the nose, causing it to tickle; and from these, to the cells which command the various respiratory muscles (the orbiculars included) which expel the air in so peculiar a manner that it rushes through the nostrils alone. to return to our point: why are tears secreted during a screaming-fit or other violent expiratory efforts? as a slight blow on the eyelids causes a copious secretion of tears, it is at least possible that the spasmodic contraction of the eyelids, by pressing strongly on the eyeball, should in a similar manner cause some secretion. this seems possible, although the voluntary contraction of the same muscles does not produce any such effect. we know that a man cannot voluntarily sneeze or cough with nearly the same force as he does automatically; and so it is with the contraction of the orbicular muscles: sir c. bell experimented on them, and found that by suddenly and forcibly closing the eyelids in the dark, sparks of light are seen, like those caused by tapping the eyelids with the fingers; "but in sneezing the compression is both more rapid and more forcible, and the sparks are more brilliant." that these sparks are due to the contraction of the eyelids is clear, because if they "are held open during the act of sneezing, no sensation of light will be experienced." in the peculiar cases referred to by professor donders and mr. bowman, we have seen that some weeks after the eye has been very slightly injured, spasmodic contractions of the eyelids ensue, and these are accompanied by a profuse flow of tears. in the act of yawning, the tears are apparently due solely to the spasmodic contraction of the muscles round the eyes. notwithstanding these latter cases, it seems hardly credible that the pressure of the eyelids on the surface of the eye, although effected spasmodically and therefore with much greater force than can be done voluntarily, should be sufficient to cause by reflex action the secretion of tears in the many cases in which this occurs during violent expiratory efforts. another cause may come conjointly into play. we have seen that the internal parts of the eye, under certain conditions act in a reflex manner on the lacrymal glands. we know that during violent expiratory efforts the pressure of the arterial blood within the vessels of the eye is increased, and that the return of the venous blood is impeded. it seems, therefore, not improbable that the distension of the ocular vessels, thus induced, might act by reflection on the lacrymal glands--the effects due to the spasmodic pressure of the eyelids on the surface of the eye being thus increased. in considering how far this view is probable, we should bear in mind that the eyes of infants have been acted on in this double manner during numberless generations, whenever they have screamed; and on the principle of nerve-force readily passing along accustomed channels, even a moderate compression of the eyeballs and a moderate distension of the ocular vessels would ultimately come, through habit, to act on the glands. we have an analogous case in the orbicular muscles being almost always contracted in some slight degree, even during a gentle crying-fit, when there can be no distension of the vessels and no uncomfortable sensation excited within the eyes. moreover, when complex actions or movements have long been performed in strict association together, and these are from any cause at first voluntarily and afterwards habitually checked, then if the proper exciting conditions occur, any part of the action or movement which is least under the control of the will, will often still be involuntarily performed. the secretion by a gland is remarkably free from the influence of the will; therefore, when with the advancing age of the individual, or with the advancing culture of the race, the habit of crying out or screaming is restrained, and there is consequently no distension of the blood-vessels of the eye, it may nevertheless well happen that tears should still be secreted. we may see, as lately remarked, the muscles round the eyes of a person who reads a pathetic story, twitching or trembling in so slight a degree as hardly to be detected. in this case there has been no screaming and no distension of the blood-vessels, yet through habit certain nerve-cells send a small amount of nerve-force to the cells commanding the muscles round the eyes; and they likewise send some to the cells commanding the lacrymal glands, for the eyes often become at the same time just moistened with tears. if the twitching of the muscles round the eyes and the secretion of tears had been completely prevented, nevertheless it is almost certain that there would have been some tendency to transmit nerve-force in these same directions; and as the lacrymal glands are remarkably free from the control of the will, they would be eminently liable still to act, thus betraying, though there were no other outward signs, the pathetic thoughts which were passing through the person's mind. as a further illustration of the view here advanced, i may remark that if, during an early period of life, when habits of all kinds are readily established, our infants, when pleased, had been accustomed to utter loud peals of laughter (during which the vessels of their eyes are distended) as often and as continuously as they have yielded when distressed to screaming-fits, then it is probable that in after life tears would have been as copiously and as regularly secreted under the one state of mind as under the other. gentle laughter, or a smile, or even a pleasing thought, would have sufficed to cause a moderate secretion of tears. there does indeed exist an evident tendency in this direction, as will be seen in a future chapter, when we treat of the tender feelings. with the sandwich islanders, according to freycinet,[624] tears are actually recognized as a sign of happiness; but we should require better evidence on this head than that of a passing voyager. so again if our infants, during many generations, and each of them during several years, had almost daily suffered from prolonged choking-fits, during which the vessels of the eye are distended and tears copiously secreted, then it is probable, such is the force of associated habit, that during after life the mere thought of a choke, without any distress of mind, would have sufficed to bring tears into our eyes. to sum up this chapter, weeping is probably the result of some such chain of events as follows. children, when wanting food or suffering in any way, cry out loudly, like the young of most other animals, partly as a call to their parents for aid, and partly from any great exertion serving relief. prolonged screaming inevitably leads to the gorging of the blood-vessels of the eye; and this will have led, at first consciously and at last habitually, to the contraction of the muscles round the eyes in order to protect them. at the same time the spasmodic pressure on the surface of the eye, and the distension of the vessels within the eye, without necessarily entailing any conscious sensation, will have affected, through reflex action, the lacrymal glands. finally, through the three principles of nerve-force readily passing along accustomed channels--of association, which is so widely extended in its power--and of certain actions, being more under the control of the will than others--it has come to pass that suffering readily causes the secretion of tears, without being necessarily accompanied by any other action. although in accordance with this view we must look at weeping as an incidental result, as purposeless as the secretion of tears from a blow outside the eye, or as a sneeze from the retina being affected by a bright light, yet this does not present any difficulty in our understanding how the secretion of tears serves as a relief to suffering. and by as much as the weeping is more violent or hysterical, by so much will the relief be greater,--on the same principle that the writhing of the whole body, the grinding of the teeth, and the uttering of piercing shrieks, all give relief under an agony of pain. chapter vii. -- low spirits, anxiety, grief, dejection, despair. general effect of grief on the system--obliquity of the eyebrows under suffering--on the cause of the obliquity of the eyebrows--on the depression of the corners of the mouth. after the mind has suffered from an acute paroxysm of grief, and the cause still continues, we fall into a state of low spirits; or we may be utterly cast down and dejected. prolonged bodily pain, if not amounting to an agony, generally leads to the same state of mind. if we expect to suffer, we are anxious; if we have no hope of relief, we despair. persons suffering from excessive grief often seek relief by violent and almost frantic movements, as described in a former chapter; but when their suffering is somewhat mitigated, yet prolonged, they no longer wish for action, but remain motionless and passive, or may occasionally rock themselves to and fro. the circulation becomes languid; the face pale; the muscles flaccid; the eyelids droop; the head hangs on the contracted chest; the lips, cheeks, and lower jaw all sink downwards from their own weight. hence all the features are lengthened; and the face of a person who hears bad news is said to fall. a party of natives in tierra del fuego endeavoured to explain to us that their friend, the captain of a sealing vessel, was out of spirits, by pulling down their cheeks with both hands, so as to make their faces as long as possible. mr. bunnet informs me that the australian aborigines when out of spirits have a chop-fallen appearance. after prolonged suffering the eyes become dull and lack expression, and are often slightly suffused with tears. the eyebrows not rarely are rendered oblique, which is due to their inner ends being raised. this produces peculiarly-formed wrinkles on the forehead, which are very different from those of a simple frown; though in some cases a frown alone may be present. the comers of the mouth are drawn downwards, which is so universally recognized as a sign of being out of spirits, that it is almost proverbial. the breathing becomes slow and feeble, and is often interrupted by deep sighs. as gratiolet remarks, whenever our attention is long concentrated on any subject, we forget to breathe, and then relieve ourselves by a deep inspiration; but the sighs of a sorrowful person, owing to his slow respiration and languid circulation, are eminently characteristic.[701] as the grief of a person in this state occasionally recurs and increases into a paroxysm, spasms affect the respiratory muscles, and he feels as if something, the so-called _globus hystericus_, was rising in his throat. these spasmodic movements are clearly allied to the sobbing of children, and are remnants of those severer spasms which occur when a person is said to choke from excessive grief.[702] _obliquity of the eyebrows_.--two points alone in the above description require further elucidation, and these are very curious ones; namely, the raising of the inner ends of the eyebrows, and the drawing down of the corners of the mouth. with respect to the eyebrows, they may occasionally be seen to assume an oblique position in persons suffering from deep dejection or anxiety; for instance, i have observed this movement in a mother whilst speaking about her sick son; and it is sometimes excited by quite trifling or momentary causes of real or pretended distress. the eyebrows assume this position owing to the contraction of certain muscles (namely, the orbiculars, corrugators, and pyramidals of the nose, which together tend to lower and contract the eyebrows) being partially cheeked by the more powerful action of the central fasciæ of the frontal muscle. these latter fasciæ by their contraction raise the inner ends alone of the eyebrows; and as the corrugators at the same time draw the eyebrows together, their inner ends become puckered into a fold or lump. this fold is a highly characteristic point in the appearance of the eyebrows when rendered oblique, as may be seen in figs. 2 and 5, plate ii. the eyebrows are at the same time somewhat roughened, owing to the hairs being made to project. dr. j. crichton browne has also often noticed in melancholic patients who keep their eyebrows persistently oblique, "a peculiar acute arching of the upper eyelid." a trace of this may be observed by comparing the right and left eyelids of the young man in the photograph (fig. 2, plate ii.); for he was not able to act equally on both eyebrows. this is also shown by the unequal furrows on the two sides of his forehead. the acute arching of the eyelids depends, i believe, on the inner end alone of the eyebrows being raised; for when the whole eyebrow is elevated and arched, the upper eyelid follows in a slight degree the same movement. [illustration: obliquity of the eyebrows. plate ii] but the most conspicuous result of the opposed contraction of the above-named muscles, is exhibited by the peculiar furrows formed on the forehead. these muscles, when thus in conjoint yet opposed action, may be called, for the sake of brevity, the grief-muscles. when a person elevates his eyebrows by the contraction of the whole frontal muscle, transverse wrinkles extend across the whole breadth of the forehead; but in the present case the middle fasciae alone are contracted; consequently, transverse furrows are formed across the middle part alone of the forehead. the skin over the exterior parts of both eyebrows is at the same time drawn downwards and smooth, by the contraction of the outer portions of the orbicular muscles. the eyebrows are likewise brought together through the simultaneous contraction of the corrugators;[703] and this latter action generates vertical furrows, separating the exterior and lowered part of the skin of the forehead from the central and raised part. the union of these vertical furrows with the central and transverse furrows (see figs. 2 and 3) produces a mark on the forehead which has been compared to a horse-shoe; but the furrows more strictly form three sides of a quadrangle. they are often conspicuous on the foreheads of adult or nearly adult persons, when their eyebrows are made oblique; but with young children, owing to their skin not easily wrinkling, they are rarely seen, or mere traces of them can be detected. these peculiar furrows are best represented in fig. 3, plate ii., on the forehead of a young lady who has the power in an unusual degree of voluntarily acting on the requisite muscles. as she was absorbed in the attempt, whilst being photographed, her expression was not at all one of grief; i have therefore given the forehead alone. fig. 1 on the same plate, copied from dr. du-chenne's work,[704] represents, on a reduced scale, the face, in its natural state, of a young man who was a good actor. in fig. 2 he is shown simulating grief, but the two eyebrows, as before remarked, are not equally acted on. that the expression is true, may be inferred from the fact that out of fifteen persons, to whom the original photograph was shown, without any clue to what was intended being given them, fourteen immediately answered, "despairing sorrow," "suffering endurance," "melancholy," and so forth. the history of fig. 5 is rather curious: i saw the photograph in a shop-window, and took it to mr. rejlander for the sake of finding out by whom it had been made; remarking to him how pathetic the expression was. he answered, "i made it, and it was likely to be pathetic, for the boy in a few minutes burst out crying." he then showed me a photograph of the same boy in a placid state, which i have had (fig. 4) reproduced. in fig. 6, a trace of obliquity in the eyebrows may be detected; but this figure, as well as fig. 7, is given to show the depression of the corners of the mouth, to which subject i shall presently refer. few persons, without some practice, can voluntarily act on their grief-muscles; but after repeated trials a considerable number succeed, whilst others never can. the degree of obliquity in the eyebrows, whether assumed voluntarily or unconsciously, differs much in different persons. with some who apparently have unusually strong pyramidal muscles, the contraction of the central fasciae of the frontal muscle, although it may be energetic, as shown by the quadrangular furrows on the forehead, does not raise the inner ends of the eyebrows, but only prevents their being so much lowered as they otherwise would have been. as far as i have been able to observe, the grief-muscles are brought into action much more frequently by children and women than by men. they are rarely acted on, at least with grown-up persons, from bodily pain, but almost exclusively from mental distress. two persons who, after some practice, succeeded in acting on their grief-muscles, found by looking at a mirror that when they made their eyebrows oblique, they unintentionally at the same time depressed the corners of their mouths; and this is often the case when the expression is naturally assumed. the power to bring the grief-muscles freely into play appears to be hereditary, like almost every other human faculty. a lady belonging to a family famous for having produced an extraordinary number of great actors and actresses, and who can herself give this expression "with singular precision," told dr. crichton browne that all her family had possessed the power in a remarkable degree. the same hereditary tendency is said to have extended, as i likewise hear from dr. browne, to the last descendant of the family, which gave rise to sir walter scott's novel of 'red gauntlet;' but the hero is described as contracting his forehead into a horseshoe mark from any strong emotion. i have also seen a young woman whose forehead seemed almost habitually thus contracted, independently of any emotion being at the time felt. the grief-muscles are not very frequently brought into play; and as the action is often momentary, it easily escapes observation. although the expression, when observed, is universally and instantly recognized as that of grief or anxiety, yet not one person out of a thousand who has never studied the subject, is able to say precisely what change passes over the sufferer's face. hence probably it is that this expression is not even alluded to, as far as i have noticed, in any work of fiction, with the exception of 'red gauntlet' and of one other novel; and the authoress of the latter, as i am informed, belongs to the famous family of actors just alluded to; so that her attention may have been specially called to the subject. the ancient greek sculptors were familiar with the expression, as shown in the statues of the laocoon and arretino; but, as duchenne remarks, they carried the transverse furrows across the whole breadth of the forehead, and thus committed a great anatomical mistake: this is likewise the case in some modern statues. it is, however, more probable that these wonderfully accurate observers intentionally sacrificed truth for the sake of beauty, than that they made a mistake; for rectangular furrows on the forehead would not have had a grand appearance on the marble. the expression, in its fully developed condition, is, as far as i can discover, not often represented in pictures by the old masters, no doubt owing to the same cause; but a lady who is perfectly familiar with this expression, informs me that in fra angelico's 'descent from the cross' in florence, it is clearly exhibited in one of the figures on the right-hand; and i could add a few other instances. dr. crichton browne, at my request, closely attended to this expression in the numerous insane patients under his care in the west biding asylum; and he is familiar with duchenne's photographs of the action of the grief-muscles. he informs me that they may constantly be seen in energetic action in cases of melancholia, and especially of hypochondria; and that the persistent lines or furrows, due to their habitual contraction, are characteristic of the physiognomy of the insane belonging to these two classes. dr. browne carefully observed for me during a considerable period three cases of hypochondria, in which the grief-muscles were persistently contracted. in one of these, a widow, aged 51, fancied that she had lost all her viscera, and that her whole body was empty. she wore an expression of great distress, and beat her semi-closed hands rhythmically together for hours. the grief-muscles were permanently contracted, and the upper eyelids arched. this condition lasted for months; she then recovered, and her countenance resumed its natural expression. a second case presented nearly the same peculiarities, with the addition that the comers of the mouth were depressed. mr. patrick nicol has also kindly observed for me several cases in the sussex lunatic asylum, and has communicated to me full details with respect to three of them; but they need not here be given. from his observations on melancholic patients, mr. nicol concludes that the inner ends of the eyebrows are almost always more or less raised, with the wrinkles on the forehead more or less plainly marked. in the case of one young woman, these wrinkles were observed to be in constant slight play or movement. in some cases the comers of the mouth are depressed, but often only in a slight degree. some amount of difference in the expression of the several melancholic patients could almost always be observed. the eyelids generally droop; and the skin near their outer comers and beneath them is wrinkled. the naso-labial fold, which runs from the wings of the nostrils to the comers of the mouth, and which is so conspicuous in blubbering children, is often plainly marked in these patients. although with the insane the grief-muscles often act persistently; yet in ordinary cases they are sometimes brought unconsciously into momentary action by ludicrously slight causes. a gentleman rewarded a young lady by an absurdly small present; she pretended to be offended, and as she upbraided him, her eyebrows became extremely oblique, with the forehead properly wrinkled. another young lady and a youth, both in the highest spirits, were eagerly talking together with extraordinary rapidity; and i noticed that, as often as the young lady was beaten, and could not get out her words fast enough, her eyebrows went obliquely upwards, and rectangular furrows were formed on her forehead. she thus each time hoisted a flag of distress; and this she did half-a-dozen times in the course of a few minutes. i made no remark on the subject, but on a subsequent occasion i asked her to act on her grief-muscles; another girl who was present, and who could do so voluntarily, showing her what was intended. she tried repeatedly, but utterly failed; yet so slight a cause of distress as not being able to talk quickly enough, sufficed to bring these muscles over and over again into energetic action. the expression of grief, due to the contraction of the grief-muscles, is by no means confined to europeans, but appears to be common to all the races of mankind. i have, at least, received trustworthy accounts in regard to hindoos, dhangars (one of the aboriginal hill-tribes of india, and therefore belonging to a quite distinct race from the hindoos), malays, negroes and australians. with respect to the latter, two observers answer my query in the affirmative, but enter into no details. mr. taplin, however, appends to my descriptive remarks the words "this is exact." with respect to negroes, the lady who told me of fra angelico's picture, saw a negro towing a boat on the nile, and as he encountered an obstruction, she observed his grief-muscles in strong action, with the middle of the forehead well wrinkled. mr. geach watched a malay man in malacca, with the comers of his mouth much depressed, the eyebrows oblique, with deep short grooves on the forehead. this expression lasted for a very short time; and mr. geach remarks it "was a strange one, very much like a person about to cry at some great loss." in india mr. h. erskine found that the natives were familiar with this expression; and mr. j. scott, of the botanic gardens, calcutta, has obligingly sent me a full description of two cases. he observed during some time, himself unseen, a very young dhangar woman from nag-pore, the wife of one of the gardeners, nursing her baby who was at the point of death; and he distinctly saw the eyebrows raised at the inner comers, the eyelids drooping, the forehead wrinkled in the middle, the mouth slightly open, with the comers much depressed. he then came from behind a screen of plants and spoke to the poor woman, who started, burst into a bitter flood of tears, and besought him to cure her baby. the second case was that of a hindustani man, who from illness and poverty was compelled to sell his favourite goat. after receiving the money, he repeatedly looked at the money in his hand and then at the goat, as if doubting whether he would not return it. he went to the goat, which was tied up ready to be led away, and the animal reared up and licked his hands. his eyes then wavered from side to side; his "mouth was partially closed, with the corners very decidedly depressed." at last the poor man seemed to make up his mind that he must part with his goat, and then, as mr. scott saw, the eyebrows became slightly oblique, with the characteristic puckering or swelling at the inner ends, but the wrinkles on the forehead were not present. the man stood thus for a minute, then heaving a deep sigh, burst into tears, raised up his two hands, blessed the goat, turned round, and without looking again, went away. _on the cause of the obliquity of the eyebrows under suffering_.--during several years no expression seemed to me so utterly perplexing as this which we are here considering. why should grief or anxiety cause the central fasciae alone of the frontal muscle together with those round the eyes, to contract? here we seem to have a complex movement for the sole purpose of expressing grief; and yet it is a comparatively rare expression, and often overlooked. i believe the explanation is not so difficult as it at first appears. dr. duchenne gives a photograph of the young man before referred to, who, when looking upwards at a strongly illuminated surface, involuntarily contracted his grief-muscles in an exaggerated manner. i had entirely forgotten this photograph, when on a very bright day with the sun behind me, i met, whilst on horseback, a girl whose eyebrows, as she looked up at me, became extremely oblique, with the proper furrows on her forehead. i have observed the same movement under similar circumstances on several subsequent occasions. on my return home i made three of my children, without giving them any clue to my object, look as long and as attentively as they could, at the summit of a tall tree standing against an extremely bright sky. with all three, the orbicular, corrugator, and pyramidal muscles were energetically contracted, through reflex action, from the excitement of the retina, so that their eyes might be protected from the bright light. but they tried their utmost to look upwards; and now a curious struggle, with spasmodic twitchings, could be observed between the whole or only the central portion of the frontal muscle, and the several muscles which serve to lower the eyebrows and close the eyelids. the involuntary contraction of the pyramidal caused the basal part of their noses to be transversely and deeply wrinkled. in one of the three children, the whole eyebrows were momentarily raised and lowered by the alternate contraction of the whole frontal muscle and of the muscles surrounding the eyes, so that the whole breadth of the forehead was alternately wrinkled and smoothed. in the other two children the forehead became wrinkled in the middle part alone, rectangular furrows being thus produced; and the eyebrows were rendered oblique, with their inner extremities puckered and swollen,--in the one child in a slight degree, in the other in a strongly marked manner. this difference in the obliquity of the eyebrows apparently depended on a difference in their general mobility, and in the strength of the pyramidal muscles. in both these cases the eyebrows and forehead were acted on under the influence of a strong light, in precisely the same manner, in every characteristic detail, as under the influence of grief or anxiety. duchenne states that the pyramidal muscle of the nose is less under the control of the will than are the other muscles round the eyes. he remarks that the young man who could so well act on his grief-muscles, as well as on most of his other facial muscles, could not contract the pyramidals.[705] this power, however, no doubt differs in different persons. the pyramidal muscle serves to draw down the skin of the forehead between the eyebrows, together with their inner extremities. the central fasciae of the frontal are the antagonists of the pyramidal; and if the action of the latter is to be specially checked, these central fasciae must be contracted. so that with persons having powerful pyramidal muscles, if there is under the influence of a bright light an unconscious desire to prevent the lowering of the eyebrows, the central fasciae of the frontal muscle must be brought into play; and their contraction, if sufficiently strong to overmaster the pyramidals, together with the contraction of the corrugator and orbicular muscles, will act in the manner just described on the eyebrows and forehead. when children scream or cry out, they contract, as we know, the orbicular, corrugator, and pyramidal muscles, primarily for the sake of compressing their eyes, and thus protecting them from being gorged with blood, and secondarily through habit. i therefore expected to find with children, that when they endeavoured either to prevent a crying-fit from coming on, or to stop crying, they would cheek the contraction of the above-named muscles, in the same manner as when looking upwards at a bright light; and consequently that the central fasciae of the frontal muscle would often be brought into play. accordingly, i began myself to observe children at such times, and asked others, including some medical men, to do the same. it is necessary to observe carefully, as the peculiar opposed action of these muscles is not nearly so plain in children, owing to their foreheads not easily wrinkling, as in adults. but i soon found that the grief-muscles were very frequently brought into distinct action on these occasions. it would be superfluous to give all the cases which have been observed; and i will specify only a few. a little girl, a year and a half old, was teased by some other children, and before bursting into tears her eyebrows became decidedly oblique. with an older girl the same obliquity was observed, with the inner ends of the eyebrows plainly puckered; and at the same time the corners of the mouth were drawn downwards. as soon as she burst into tears, the features all changed and this peculiar expression vanished. again, after a little boy had been vaccinated, which made him scream and cry violently, the surgeon gave him an orange brought for the purpose, and this pleased the child much; as he stopped crying all the characteristic movements were observed, including the formation of rectangular wrinkles in the middle of the forehead. lastly, i met on the road a little girl three or four years old, who had been frightened by a dog, and when i asked her what was the matter, she stopped whimpering, and her eyebrows instantly became oblique to an extraordinary degree. here then, as i cannot doubt, we have the key to the problem why the central fasciae of the frontal muscle and the muscles round the eyes contract in opposition to each other under the influence of grief;--whether their contraction be prolonged, as with the melancholic insane, or momentary, from some trifling cause of distress. we have all of us, as infants, repeatedly contracted our orbicular, corrugator, and pyramidal muscles, in order to protect our eyes whilst screaming; our progenitors before us have done the same during many generations; and though with advancing years we easily prevent, when feeling distressed, the utterance of screams, we cannot from long habit always prevent a slight contraction of the above-named muscles; nor indeed do we observe their contraction in ourselves, or attempt to stop it, if slight. but the pyramidal muscles seem to be less under the command of the will than the other related muscles; and if they be well developed, their contraction can be checked only by the antagonistic contraction of the central fasciae of the frontal muscle. the result which necessarily follows, if these fasciae contract energetically, is the oblique drawing up of the eyebrows, the puckering of their inner ends, and the formation of rectangular furrows on the middle of the forehead. as children and women cry much more freely than men, and as grown-up persons of both sexes rarely weep except from mental distress, we can understand why the grief-muscles are more frequently seen in action, as i believe to be the case, with children and women than with men; and with adults of both sexes from mental distress alone. in some of the cases before recorded, as in that of the poor dhangar woman and of the hindustani man, the action of the grief-muscles was quickly followed by bitter weeping. in all cases of distress, whether great or small, our brains tend through long habit to send an order to certain muscles to contract, as if we were still infants on the point of screaming out; but this order we, by the wondrous power of the will, and through habit, are able partially to counteract; although this is effected unconsciously, as far as the means of counteraction are concerned. _on the depression of the corners of the mouth_.--this action is effected by the _depressores anguili oris_ (see letter k in figs. 1 and 2). the fibres of this muscle diverge downwards, with the upper convergent ends attached round the angles of the mouth, and to the lower lip a little way within the angles.[706] some of the fibres appear to be antagonistic to the great zygomatic muscle, and others to the several muscles running to the outer part of the upper lip. the contraction of this muscle draws downwards and outwards the corners of the mouth, including the outer part of the upper lip, and even in a slight degree the wings of the nostrils. when the mouth is closed and this muscle acts, the commissure or line of junction of the two lips forms a curved line with the concavity downwards,[707] and the lips themselves are generally somewhat protruded, especially the lower one. the mouth in this state is well represented in the two photographs (plate ii., figs. 6 and 7) by mr. rejlander. the upper boy (fig. 6) had just stopped crying, after receiving a slap on the face from another boy; and the right moment was seized for photographing him. the expression of low spirits, grief or dejection, due to the contraction of this muscle has been noticed by every one who has written on the subject. to say that a person "is down in the mouth," is synonymous with saying that he is out of spirits. the depression of the corners may often be seen, as already stated on the authority of dr. crichton browne and mr. nicol, with the melancholic insane, and was well exhibited in some photographs sent to me by the former gentleman, of patients with a strong tendency to suicide. it has been observed with men belonging to various races, namely with hindoos, the dark hill-tribes of india, malays, and, as the rev. mr. hagenauer informs me, with the aborigines of australia. when infants scream they firmly contract the muscles round their eyes, and this draws up the upper lip; and as they have to keep their mouths widely open, the depressor muscles running to the corners are likewise brought into strong action. this generally, but not invariably, causes a slight angular bend in the lower lip on both sides, near the corners of the mouth. the result of the upper and lower lip being thus acted on is that the mouth assumes a squarish outline. the contraction of the depressor muscle is best seen in infants when not screaming violently, and especially just before they begin, or when they cease to scream. their little faces then acquire an extremely piteous expression, as i continually observed with my own infants between the ages of about six weeks and two or three months. sometimes, when they are struggling against a crying-fit, the outline of the mouth is curved in so exaggerated a manner as to be like a horseshoe; and the expression of misery then becomes a ludicrous caricature. the explanation of the contraction of this muscle, under the influence of low spirits or dejection, apparently follows from the same general principles as in the case of the obliquity of the eyebrows. dr. duchenne informs me that he concludes from his observations, now prolonged during many years, that this is one of the facial muscles which is least under the control of the will. this fact may indeed be inferred from what has just been stated with respect to infants when doubtfully beginning to cry, or endeavouring to stop crying; for they then generally command all the other facial muscles more effectually than they do the depressors of the corners of the mouth. two excellent observers who had no theory on the subject, one of them a surgeon, carefully watched for me some older children and women as with some opposed struggling they very gradually approached the point of bursting out into tears; and both observers felt sure that the depressors began to act before any of the other muscles. now as the depressors have been repeatedly brought into strong action during infancy in many generations, nerve-force will tend to flow, on the principle of long associated habit, to these muscles as well as to various other facial muscles, whenever in after life even a slight feeling of distress is experienced. but as the depressors are somewhat less under the control of the will than most of the other muscles, we might expect that they would often slightly contract, whilst the others remained passive. it is remarkable how small a depression of the corners of the mouth gives to the countenance an expression of low spirits or dejection, so that an extremely slight contraction of these muscles would be sufficient to betray this state of mind. i may here mention a trifling observation, as it will serve to sum up our present subject. an old lady with a comfortable but absorbed expression sat nearly opposite to me in a railway carriage. whilst i was looking at her, i saw that her _depressores anguli oris_ became very slightly, yet decidedly, contracted; but as her countenance remained as placid as ever, i reflected how meaningless was this contraction, and how easily one might be deceived. the thought had hardly occurred to me when i saw that her eyes suddenly became suffused with tears almost to overflowing, and her whole countenance fell. there could now be no doubt that some painful recollection, perhaps that of a long-lost child, was passing through her mind. as soon as her sensorium was thus affected, certain nerve-cells from long habit instantly transmitted an order to all the respiratory muscles, and to those round the mouth, to prepare for a fit of crying. but the order was countermanded by the will, or rather by a later acquired habit, and all the muscles were obedient, excepting in a slight degree the _depressores anguli oris_. the mouth was not even opened; the respiration was not hurried; and no muscle was affected except those which draw down the corners of the mouth. as soon as the mouth of this lady began, involuntarily and unconsciously on her part, to assume the proper form for a crying-fit, we may feel almost sure that some nerve-influence would have been transmitted through the long accustomed channels to the various respiratory muscles, as well as to those round the eyes, and to the vaso-motor centre which governs the supply of blood sent to the lacrymal glands. of this latter fact we have indeed clear evidence in her eyes becoming slightly suffused with tears; and we can understand this, as the lacrymal glands are less under the control of the will than the facial muscles. no doubt there existed at the same time some tendency in the muscles round the eyes at contract, as if for the sake of protecting them from being gorged with blood, but this contraction was completely overmastered, and her brow remained unruffled. had the pyramidal, corrugator, and orbicular muscles been as little obedient to the will, as they are in many persons, they would have been slightly acted on; and then the central fasciae of the frontal muscle would have contracted in antagonism, and her eyebrows would have become oblique, with rectangular furrows on her forehead. her countenance would then have expressed still more plainly than it did a state of dejection, or rather one of grief. through steps such as these we can understand how it is, that as soon as some melancholy thought passes through the brain, there occurs a just perceptible drawing down of the corners of the mouth, or a slight raising up of the inner ends of the eyebrows, or both movements combined, and immediately afterwards a slight suffusion of tears. a thrill of nerve-force is transmitted along several habitual channels, and produces an effect on any point where the will has not acquired through long habit much power of interference. the above actions may be considered as rudimental vestiges of the screaming-fits, which are so frequent and prolonged during infancy. in this case, as well as in many others, the links are indeed wonderful which connect cause and effect in giving rise to various expressions on the human countenance; and they explain to us the meaning of certain movements, which we involuntarily and unconsciously perform, whenever certain transitory emotions pass through our minds. chapter viii. -- joy, high spirits, love, tender feelings, devotion. laughter primarily the expression of joy--ludicrous ideas--movements of the features during laughter--nature of the sound produced--the secretion of tears during loud laughter--gradation from loud laughter to gentle smiling--high spirits--the expression of love--tender feelings--devotion. joy, when intense, leads to various purposeless movements--to dancing about, clapping the hands, stamping, &c., and to loud laughter. laughter seems primarily to be the expression of mere joy or happiness. we clearly see this in children at play, who are almost incessantly laughing. with young persons past childhood, when they are in high spirits, there is always much meaningless laughter. the laughter of the gods is described by homer as "the exuberance of their celestial joy after their daily banquet." a man smiles--and smiling, as we shall see, graduates into laughter--at meeting an old friend in the street, as he does at any trifling pleasure, such as smelling a sweet perfume.[801] laura bridgman, from her blindness and deafness, could not have acquired any expression through imitation, yet when a letter from a beloved friend was communicated to her by gesture-language, she "laughed and clapped her hands, and the colour mounted to her cheeks." on other occasions she has been seen to stamp for joy.[802] idiots and imbecile persons likewise afford good evidence that laughter or smiling primarily expresses mere happiness or joy. dr. crichton browne, to whom, as on so many other occasions, i am indebted for the results of his wide experience, informs me that with idiots laughter is the most prevalent and frequent of all the emotional expressions. many idiots are morose, passionate, restless, in a painful state of mind, or utterly stolid, and these never laugh. others frequently laugh in a quite senseless manner. thus an idiot boy, incapable of speech, complained to dr. browne, by the aid of signs, that another boy in the asylum had given him a black eye; and this was accompanied by "explosions of laughter and with his face covered with the broadest smiles." there is another large class of idiots who are persistently joyous and benign, and who are constantly laughing or smiling.[803] their countenances often exhibit a stereotyped smile; their joyousness is increased, and they grin, chuckle, or giggle, whenever food is placed before them, or when they are caressed, are shown bright colours, or hear music. some of them laugh more than usual when they walk about, or attempt any muscular exertion. the joyousness of most of these idiots cannot possibly be associated, as dr. browne remarks, with any distinct ideas: they simply feel pleasure, and express it by laughter or smiles. with imbeciles rather higher in the scale, personal vanity seems to be the commonest cause of laughter, and next to this, pleasure arising from the approbation of their conduct. with grown-up persons laughter is excited by causes considerably different from those which suffice during childhood; but this remark hardly applies to smiling. laughter in this respect is analogous with weeping, which with adults is almost confined to mental distress, whilst with children it is excited by bodily pain or any suffering, as well as by fear or rage. many curious discussions have been written on the causes of laughter with grown-up persons. the subject is extremely complex. something incongruous or unaccountable, exciting surprise and some sense of superiority in the laugher, who must be in a happy frame of mind, seems to be the commonest cause.[804] the circumstances must not be of a momentous nature: no poor man would laugh or smile on suddenly hearing that a large fortune had been bequeathed to him. if the mind is strongly excited by pleasurable feelings, and any little unexpected event or thought occurs, then, as mr. herbert spencer remarks,[805] "a large amount of nervous energy, instead of being allowed to expend itself in producing an equivalent amount of the new thoughts and emotion which were nascent, is suddenly checked in its flow."... "the excess must discharge itself in some other direction, and there results an efflux through the motor nerves to various classes of the muscles, producing the half-convulsive actions we term laughter." an observation, bearing on this point, was made by a correspondent during the recent siege of paris, namely, that the german soldiers, after strong excitement from exposure to extreme danger, were particularly apt to burst out into loud laughter at the smallest joke. so again when young children are just beginning to cry, an unexpected event will sometimes suddenly turn their crying into laughter, which apparently serves equally well to expend their superfluous nervous energy. the imagination is sometimes said to be tickled by a ludicrous idea; and this so-called tickling of the mind is curiously analogous with that of the body. every one knows how immoderately children laugh, and how their whole bodies are convulsed when they are tickled. the anthropoid apes, as we have seen, likewise utter a reiterated sound, corresponding with our laughter, when they are tickled, especially under the armpits. i touched with a bit of paper the sole of the foot of one of my infants, when only seven days old, and it was suddenly jerked away and the toes curled about, as in an older child. such movements, as well as laughter from being tickled, are manifestly reflex actions; and this is likewise shown by the minute unstriped muscles, which serve to erect the separate hairs on the body, contracting near a tickled surface.[806] yet laughter from a ludicrous idea, though involuntary, cannot be called a strictly reflex action. in this case, and in that of laughter from being tickled, the mind must be in a pleasurable condition; a young child, if tickled by a strange man, would scream from fear. the touch must be light, and an idea or event, to be ludicrous, must not be of grave import. the parts of the body which are most easily tickled are those which are not commonly touched, such as the armpits or between the toes, or parts such as the soles of the feet, which are habitually touched by a broad surface; but the surface on which we sit offers a marked exception to this rule. according to gratiolet,[807] certain nerves are much more sensitive to tickling than others. from the fact that a child can hardly tickle itself, or in a much less degree than when tickled by another person, it seems that the precise point to be touched must not be known; so with the mind, something unexpected--a novel or incongruous idea which breaks through an habitual train of thought--appears to be a strong element in the ludicrous. the sound of laughter is produced by a deep inspiration followed by short, interrupted, spasmodic contractions of the chest, and especially of the diaphragm.[808] hence we hear of "laughter holding both his sides." from the shaking of the body, the head nods to and fro. the lower jaw often quivers up and down, as is likewise the case with some species of baboons, when they are much pleased. [illustration: moderate laughter and smiling. plate iii] during laughter the mouth is opened more or less widely, with the corners drawn much backwards, as well as a little upwards; and the upper lip is somewhat raised. the drawing back of the corners is best seen in moderate laughter, and especially in a broad smile--the latter epithet showing how the mouth is widened. in the accompanying figs. 1-3, plate iii., different degrees of moderate laughter and smiling have been photographed. the figure of the little girl, with the hat is by dr. wallich, and the expression was a genuine one; the other two are by mr. rejlander. dr. duchenne repeatedly insists[809] that, under the emotion of joy, the mouth is acted on exclusively by the great zygomatic muscles, which serve to draw the corners backwards and upwards; but judging from the manner in which the upper teeth are always exposed during laughter and broad smiling, as well as from my own sensations, i cannot doubt that some of the muscles running to the upper lip are likewise brought into moderate action. the upper and lower orbicular muscles of the eyes are at the same time more or less contracted; and there is an intimate connection, as explained in the chapter on weeping, between the orbiculars, especially the lower ones and some of the muscles running to the upper lip. henle remarks[810] on this head, that when a man closely shuts one eye he cannot avoid retracting the upper lip on the same side; conversely, if any one will place his finger on his lower eyelid, and then uncover his upper incisors as much as possible, he will feel, as his upper lip is drawn strongly upwards, that the muscles of the lower eyelid contract. in henle's drawing, given in woodcut, fig. 2, the _musculus malaris_ (h) which runs to the upper lip may be seen to form an almost integral part of the lower orbicular muscle. dr. duchenne has given a large photograph of an old man (reduced on plate iii. fig 4), in his usual passive condition, and another of the same man (fig. 5), naturally smiling. the latter was instantly recognized by every one to whom it was shown as true to nature. he has also given, as an example of an unnatural or false smile, another photograph (fig. 6) of the same old man, with the corners of his mouth strongly retracted by the galvanization of the great zygomatic muscles. that the expression is not natural is clear, for i showed this photograph to twenty-four persons, of whom three could not in the least tell what was meant, whilst the others, though they perceived that the expression was of the nature of a smile, answered in such words as "a wicked joke," "trying to laugh," "grinning laughter.... half-amazed laughter," &c. dr. duchenne attributes the falseness of the expression altogether to the orbicular muscles of the lower eyelids not being sufficiently contracted; for he justly lays great stress on their contraction in the expression of joy. no doubt there is much truth in this view, but not, as it appears to me, the whole truth. the contraction of the lower orbiculars is always accompanied, as we have seen, by the drawing up of the upper lip. had the upper lip, in fig. 6, been thus acted on to a slight extent, its curvature would have been less rigid, the naso-labial farrow would have been slightly different, and the whole expression would, as i believe, have been more natural, independently of the more conspicuous effect from the stronger contraction of the lower eyelids. the corruptor muscle, moreover, in fig. 6, is too much contracted, causing a frown; and this muscle never acts under the influence of joy except during strongly pronounced or violent laughter. by the drawing backwards and upwards of the corners of the mouth, through the contraction of the great zygomatic muscles, and by the raising of the upper lip, the cheeks are drawn upwards. wrinkles are thus formed under the eyes, and, with old people, at their outer ends; and these are highly characteristic of laughter or smiling. as a gentle smile increases into a strong one, or into a laugh, every one may feel and see, if he will attend to his own sensations and look at himself in a mirror, that as the upper lip is drawn up and the lower orbiculars contract, the wrinkles in the lower eyelids and those beneath the eyes are much strengthened or increased. at the same time, as i have repeatedly observed, the eyebrows are slightly lowered, which shows that the upper as well as the lower orbiculars contract at least to some degree, though this passes unperecived, as far as our sensations are concerned. if the original photograph of the old man, with his countenance in its usual placid state (fig. 4), be compared with that (fig. 5) in which he is naturally smiling, it may be seen that the eyebrows in the latter are a little lowered. i presume that this is owing to the upper orbiculars being impelled, through the force of long-associated habit, to act to a certain extent in concert with the lower orbiculars, which themselves contract in connection with the drawing up of the upper lip. the tendency in the zygomatic muscles to contract under pleasurable emotions is shown by a curious fact, communicated to me by dr. browne, with respect to patients suffering from general paralysis of the insane.[811] "in this malady there is almost invariably optimism--delusions as to wealth, rank, grandeur--insane joyousness, benevolence, and profusion, while its very earliest physical symptom is trembling at the corners of the mouth and at the outer corners of the eyes. this is a well-recognized fact. constant tremulous agitation of the inferior palpebral and great zygomatic muscles is pathognomic of the earlier stages of general paralysis. the countenance has a pleased and benevolent expression. as the disease advances other muscles become involved, but until complete fatuity is reached, the prevailing expression is that of feeble benevolence." as in laughing and broadly smiling the cheeks and upper lip are much raised, the nose appears to be shortened, and the skin on the bridge becomes finely wrinkled in transverse lines, with other oblique longitudinal lines on the sides. the upper front teeth are commonly exposed. a well-marked naso-labial fold is formed, which runs from the wing of each nostril to the corner of the mouth; and this fold is often double in old persons. a bright and sparkling eye is as characteristic of a pleased or amused state of mind, as is the retraction of the corners of the mouth and upper lip with the wrinkles thus produced. even the eyes of microcephalous idiots, who are so degraded that they never learn to speak, brighten slightly when they are pleased.[812] under extreme laughter the eyes are too much suffused with tears to sparkle; but the moisture squeezed out of the glands during moderate laughter or smiling may aid in giving them lustre; though this must be of altogether subordinate importance, as they become dull from grief, though they are then often moist. their brightness seems to be chiefly due to their tenseness,[813] owing to the contraction of the orbicular muscles and to the pressure of the raised cheeks. but, according to dr. piderit, who has discussed this point more fully than any other writer,[814] the tenseness may be largely attributed to the eyeballs becoming filled with blood and other fluids, from the acceleration of the circulation, consequent on the excitement of pleasure. he remarks on the contrast in the appearance of the eyes of a hectic patient with a rapid circulation, and of a man suffering from cholera with almost all the fluids of his body drained from him. any cause which lowers the circulation deadens the eye. i remember seeing a man utterly prostrated by prolonged and severe exertion during a very hot day, and a bystander compared his eyes to those of a boiled codfish. to return to the sounds produced during laughter. we can see in a vague manner how the utterance of sounds of some kind would naturally become associated with a pleasurable state of mind; for throughout a large part of the animal kingdom vocal or instrumental sounds are employed either as a call or as a charm by one sex for the other. they are also employed as the means for a joyful meeting between the parents and their offspring, and between the attached members of the same social community. but why the sounds which man utters when he is pleased have the peculiar reiterated character of laughter we do not know. nevertheless we can see that they would naturally be as different as possible from the screams or cries of distress; and as in the production of the latter, the expirations are prolonged and continuous, with the inspirations short and interrupted, so it might perhaps have been expected with the sounds uttered from joy, that the expirations would have been short and broken with the inspirations prolonged; and this is the case. it is an equally obscure point why the corners of the mouth are retracted and the upper lip raised during ordinary laughter. the mouth must not be opened to its utmost extent, for when this occurs during a paroxysm of excessive laughter hardly any sound is emitted; or it changes its tone and seems to come from deep down in the throat. the respiratory muscles, and even those of the limbs, are at the same time thrown into rapid vibratory movements. the lower jaw often partakes of this movement, and this would tend to prevent the mouth from being widely opened. but as a full volume of sound has to be poured forth, the orifice of the mouth must be large; and it is perhaps to gain this end that the corners are retracted and the upper lip raised. although we can hardly account for the shape of the mouth during laughter, which leads to wrinkles being formed beneath the eyes, nor for the peculiar reiterated sound of laughter, nor for the quivering of the jaws, nevertheless we may infer that all these effects are due to some common cause. for they are all characteristic and expressive of a pleased state of mind in various kinds of monkeys. a graduated series can be followed from violent to moderate laughter, to a broad smile, to a gentle smile, and to the expression of mere cheerfulness. during excessive laughter the whole body is often thrown backward and shakes, or is almost convulsed; the respiration is much disturbed; the head and face become gorged with blood, with the veins distended; and the orbicular muscles are spasmodically contracted in order to protect the eyes. tears are freely shed. hence, as formerly remarked, it is scarcely possible to point out any difference between the tear-stained face of a person after a paroxysm of excessive laughter and after a bitter crying-fit.[815] it is probably due to the close similarity of the spasmodic movements caused by these widely different emotions that hysteric patients alternately cry and laugh with violence, and that young children sometimes pass suddenly from the one to the other state. mr. swinhoe informs me that he has often seen the chinese, when suffering from deep grief, burst out into hysterical fits of laughter. i was anxious to know whether tears are freely shed during excessive laughter by most of the races of men, and i hear from my correspondents that this is the case. one instance was observed with the hindoos, and they themselves said that it often occurred. so it is with the chinese. the women of a wild tribe of malays in the malacca peninsula, sometimes shed tears when they laugh heartily, though this seldom occurs. with the dyaks of borneo it must frequently be the case, at least with the women, for i hear from the rajah c. brooke that it is a common expression with them to say "we nearly made tears from laughter." the aborigines of australia express their emotions freely, and they are described by my correspondents as jumping about and clapping their hands for joy, and as often roaring with laughter. no less than four observers have seen their eyes freely watering on such occasions; and in one instance the tears rolled down their cheeks. mr. bulmer, a missionary in a remote part of victoria, remarks, "that they have a keen sense of the ridiculous; they are excellent mimics, and when one of them is able to imitate the peculiarities of some absent member of the tribe, it is very common to hear all in the camp convulsed with laughter." with europeans hardly anything excites laughter so easily as mimicry; and it is rather curious to find the same fact with the savages of australia, who constitute one of the most distinct races in the world. in southern africa with two tribes of kafirs, especially with the women, their eyes often fill with tears during laughter. gaika, the brother of the chief sandilli, answers my query on this bead, with the words, "yes, that is their common practice." sir andrew smith has seen the painted face of a hottentot woman all furrowed with tears after a fit of laughter. in northern africa, with the abyssinians, tears are secreted under the same circumstances. lastly, in north america, the same fact has been observed in a remarkably savage and isolated tribe, but chiefly with the women; in another tribe it was observed only on a single occasion. excessive laughter, as before remarked, graduates into moderate laughter. in this latter case the muscles round the eyes are much less contracted, and there is little or no frowning. between a gentle laugh and a broad smile there is hardly any difference, excepting that in smiling no reiterated sound is uttered, though a single rather strong expiration, or slight noise--a rudiment of a laugh--may often be heard at the commencement of a smile. on a moderately smiling countenance the contraction of the upper orbicular muscles can still just be traced by a slight lowering of the eyebrows. the contraction of the lower orbicular and palpebral muscles is much plainer, and is shown by the wrinkling of the lower eyelids and of the skin beneath them, together with a slight drawing up of the upper lip. from the broadest smile we pass by the finest steps into the gentlest one. in this latter case the features are moved in a much less degree, and much more slowly, and the mouth is kept closed. the curvature of the naso-labial furrow is also slightly different in the two cases. we thus see that no abrupt line of demarcation can be drawn between the movement of the features during the most violent laughter and a very faint smile.[816] a smile, therefore, may be said to be the first stage in the development of a laugh. but a different and more probable view may be suggested; namely, that the habit of uttering load reiterated sounds from a sense of pleasure, first led to the retraction of the corners of the mouth and of the upper lip, and to the contraction of the orbicular muscles; and that now, through association and long-continued habit, the same muscles are brought into slight play whenever any cause excites in us a feeling which, if stronger, would have led to laughter; and the result is a smile. whether we look at laughter as the full development of a smile, or, as is more probable, at a gentle smile as the last trace of a habit, firmly fixed during many generations, of laughing whenever we are joyful, we can follow in our infants the gradual passage of the one into the other. it is well known to those who have the charge of young infants, that it is difficult to feel sure when certain movements about their mouths are really expressive; that is, when they really smile. hence i carefully watched my own infants. one of them at the age of forty-five days, and being at the time in a happy frame of mind, smiled; that is, the corners of the mouth were retracted, and simultaneously the eyes became decidedly bright. i observed the same thing on the following day; but on the third day the child was not quite well and there was no trace of a smile, and this renders it probable that the previous smiles were real. eight days subsequently and during the next succeeding week, it was remarkable how his eyes brightened whenever he smiled, and his nose became at the same time transversely wrinkled. this was now accompanied by a little bleating noise, which perhaps represented a laugh. at the age of 113 days these little noises, which were always made during expiration, assumed a slightly different character, and were more broken or interrupted, as in sobbing; and this was certainly incipient laughter. the change in tone seemed to me at the time to be connected with the greater lateral extension of the mouth as the smiles became broader. in a second infant the first real smile was observed at about the same age, viz. forty-five days; and in a third, at a somewhat earlier age. the second infant, when sixty-five days old, smiled much more broadly and plainly than did the one first mentioned at the same age; and even at this early age uttered noises very like laughter. in this gradual acquirement, by infants, of the habit of laughing, we have a case in some degree analogous to that of weeping. as practice is requisite with the ordinary movements of the body, such as walking, so it seems to be with laughing and weeping. the art of screaming, on the other hand, from being of service to infants, has become finely developed from the earliest days. _high spirits, cheerfulness_.--a man in high spirits, though he may not actually smile, commonly exhibits some tendency to the retraction of the corners of his mouth. from the excitement of pleasure, the circulation becomes more rapid; the eyes are bright, and the colour of the face rises. the brain, being stimulated by the increased flow of blood, reacts on the mental powers; lively ideas pass still more rapidly through the mind, and the affections are warmed. i heard a child, a little under four years old, when asked what was meant by being in good spirits, answer, "it is laughing, talking, and kissing." it would be difficult to give a truer and more practical definition. a man in this state holds his body erect, his head upright, and his eyes open. there is no drooping of the features, and no contraction of the eyebrows. on the contrary, the frontal muscle, as moreau observes,[817] tends to contract slightly; and this smooths the brow, removes every trace of a frown, arches the eyebrows a little, and raises the eyelids. hence the latin phrase, _exporrigere frontem_--to unwrinkle the brow--means, to be cheerful or merry. the whole expression of a man in good spirits is exactly the opposite of that of one suffering from sorrow. according to sir c. bell, "in all the exhilarating emotions the eyebrows, eyelids, the nostrils, and the angles of the mouth are raised. in the depressing passions it is the reverse." under the influence of the latter the brow is heavy, the eyelids, cheeks, mouth, and whole head droop; the eyes are dull; the countenance pallid, and the respiration slow. in joy the face expands, in grief it lengthens. whether the principle of antithesis has here come into play in producing these opposite expressions, in aid of the direct causes which have been specified and which are sufficiently plain, i will not pretend to say. with all the races of man the expression of good spirit appears to be the same, and is easily recognized. my informants, from various parts of the old and new worlds, answer in the affirmative to my queries on this head, and they give some particulars with respect to hindoos, malays, and new zealanders. the brightness of the eyes of the australians has struck four observers, and the same fact has been noticed with hindoos, new zealanders, and the dyaks of borneo. savages sometimes express their satisfaction not only by smiling, but by gestures derived from the pleasure of eating. thus mr. wedgwood[818] quotes petherick that the negroes on the upper nile began a general rubbing of their bellies when he displayed his beads; and leichhardt says that the australians smacked and clacked their mouths at the sight of his horses and bullocks, and more especially of his kangaroo dogs. the greenlanders, "when they affirm anything with pleasure, suck down air with a certain sound;"[819] and this may be an imitation of the act of swallowing savoury food. laughter is suppressed by the firm contraction of the orbicular muscles of the mouth, which prevents the great zygomatic and other muscles from drawing the lips backwards and upwards. the lower lip is also sometimes held by the teeth, and this gives a roguish expression to the face, as was observed with the blind and deaf laura bridgman.[820] the great zygomatic muscle is sometimes variable in its course, and i have seen a young woman in whom the _depressores anguli oris_ were brought into strong action in suppressing a smile; but this by no means gave to her countenance a melancholy expression, owing to the brightness of her eyes. laughter is frequently employed in a forced manner to conceal or mask some other state of mind, even anger. we often see persons laughing in order to conceal their shame or shyness. when a person purses up his mouth, as if to prevent the possibility of a smile, though there is nothing to excite one, or nothing to prevent its free indulgence, an affected, solemn, or pedantic expression is given; but of such hybrid expressions nothing more need here be said. in the case of derision, a real or pretended smile or laugh is often blended with the expression proper to contempt, and this may pass into angry contempt or scorn. in such cases the meaning of the laugh or smile is to show the offending person that he excites only amusement. _love, tender feelings, &c_.--although the emotion of love, for instance that of a mother for her infant, is one of the strongest of which the mind is capable, it can hardly be said to have any proper or peculiar means of expression; and this is intelligible, as it has not habitually led to any special line of action. no doubt, as affection is a pleasurable sensation, it generally causes a gentle smile and some brightening of the eyes. a strong desire to touch the beloved person is commonly felt; and love is expressed by this means more plainly than by any other.[821] hence we long to clasp in our arms those whom we tenderly love. we probably owe this desire to inherited habit, in association with the nursing and tending of our children, and with the mutual caresses of lovers. with the lower animals we see the same principle of pleasure derived from contact in association with love. dogs and cats manifestly take pleasure in rubbing against their masters and mistresses, and in being rubbed or patted by them. many kinds of monkeys, as i am assured by the keepers in the zoological gardens, delight in fondling and being fondled by each other, and by persons to whom they are attached. mr. bartlett has described to me the behaviour of two chimpanzees, rather older animals than those generally imported into this country, when they were first brought together. they sat opposite, touching each other with their much protruded lips; and the one put his hand on the shoulder of the other. they then mutually folded each other in their arms. afterwards they stood up, each with one arm on the shoulder of the other, lifted up their heads, opened their mouths, and yelled with delight. we europeans are so accustomed to kissing as a mark of affection, that it might be thought to be innate in mankind; but this is not the case. steele was mistaken when he said "nature was its author, and it began with the first courtship." jemmy button, the fuegian, told me that this practice was unknown in his land. it is equally unknown with the new zealanders, tahitians, papuans, australians, somals of africa, and the esquimaux. but it is so far innate or natural that it apparently depends on pleasure from close contact with a beloved person; and it is replaced in various parts of the world, by the rubbing of noses, as with the new zealanders and laplanders, by the rubbing or patting of the arms, breasts, or stomachs, or by one man striking his own face with the hands or feet of another. perhaps the practice of blowing, as a mark of affection, on various parts of the body may depend on the same principle.[823] the feelings which are called tender are difficult to analyse; they seem to be compounded of affection, joy, and especially of sympathy. these feelings are in themselves of a pleasurable nature, excepting when pity is too deep, or horror is aroused, as in hearing of a tortured man or animal. they are remarkable under our present point of view from so readily exciting the secretion of tears. many a father and son have wept on meeting after a long separation, especially if the meeting has been unexpected. no doubt extreme joy by itself tends to act on the lacrymal glands; but on such occasions as the foregoing vague thoughts of the grief which would have been felt had the father and son never met, will probably have passed through their minds; and grief naturally leads to the secretion of tears. thus on the return of ulysses:-- "telemachus rose, and clung weeping round his father's breast. there the pent grief rained o'er them, yearning thus. * * * * * * thus piteously they wailed in sore unrest, and on their weepings had gone down the day, but that at last telemachus found words to say." _worsley's translation of the odyssey_, book xvi. st. 27. so again when penelope at last recognized her husband:-- "then from her eyelids the quick tears did start and she ran to him from her place, and threw her arms about his neck, and a warm dew of kisses poured upon him, and thus spake:" --book xxiii. st. 27. the vivid recollection of our former home, or of long-past happy days, readily causes the eyes to be suffused with tears; but here, again, the thought naturally occurs that these days will never return. in such cases we may be said to sympathize with ourselves in our present, in comparison with our former, state. sympathy with the distresses of others, even with the imaginary distresses of a heroine in a pathetic story, for whom we feel no affection, readily excites tears. so does sympathy with the happiness of others, as with that of a lover, at last successful after many hard trials in a well-told tale. sympathy appears to constitute a separate or distinct emotion; and it is especially apt to excite the lacrymal glands. this holds good whether we give or receive sympathy. every one must have noticed how readily children burst out crying if we pity them for some small hurt. with the melancholic insane, as dr. crichton browne informs me, a kind word will often plunge them into unrestrained weeping. as soon as we express our pity for the grief of a friend, tears often come into our own eyes. the feeling of sympathy is commonly explained by assuming that, when we see or hear of suffering in another, the idea of suffering is called up so vividly in our own minds that we ourselves suffer. but this explanation is hardly sufficient, for it does not account for the intimate alliance between sympathy and affection. we undoubtedly sympathize far more deeply with a beloved than with an indifferent person; and the sympathy of the one gives us far more relief than that of the other. yet assuredly we can sympathize with those for whom we feel no affection. why suffering, when actually experienced by ourselves, excites weeping, has been discussed in a former chapter. with respect to joy, its natural and universal expression is laughter; and with all the races of man loud laughter leads to the secretion of tears more freely than does any other cause excepting distress. the suffusion of the eyes with tears, which undoubtedly occurs under great joy, though there is no laughter, can, as it seems to me, be explained through habit and association on the same principles as the effusion of tears from grief, although there is no screaming. nevertheless it is not a little remarkable that sympathy with the distresses of others should excite tears more freely than our own distress; and this certainly is the case. many a man, from whose eyes no suffering of his own could wring a tear, has shed tears at the sufferings of a beloved friend. it is still more remarkable that sympathy with the happiness or good fortune of those whom we tenderly love should lead to the same result, whilst a similar happiness felt by ourselves would leave our eyes dry. we should, however, bear in mind that the long-continued habit of restraint which is so powerful in checking the free flow of tears from bodily pain, has not been brought into play in preventing a moderate effusion of tears in sympathy with the sufferings or happiness of others. music has a wonderful power, as i have elsewhere attempted to show,[824] of recalling in a vague and indefinite manner, those strong emotions which were felt during long-past ages, when, as is probable, our early progenitors courted each other by the aid of vocal tones. and as several of our strongest emotions--grief, great joy, love, and sympathy--lead to the free secretion of tears, it is not surprising that music should be apt to cause our eyes to become suffused with tears, especially when we are already softened by any of the tenderer feelings. music often produces another peculiar effect. we know that every strong sensation, emotion, or excitement--extreme pain, rage, terror, joy, or the passion of love--all have a special tendency to cause the muscles to tremble; and the thrill or slight shiver which runs down the backbone and limbs of many persons when they are powerfully affected by music, seems to bear the same relation to the above trembling of the body, as a slight suffusion of tears from the power of music does to weeping from any strong and real emotion. _devotion_.--as devotion is, in some degree, related to affection, though mainly consisting of reverence, often combined with fear, the expression of this state of mind may here be briefly noticed. with some sects, both past and present, religion and love have been strangely combined; and it has even been maintained, lamentable as the fact may be, that the holy kiss of love differs but little from that which a man bestows on a woman, or a woman on a man.[825] devotion is chiefly expressed by the face being directed towards the heavens, with the eyeballs upturned. sir c. bell remarks that, at the approach of sleep, or of a fainting-fit, or of death, the pupils are drawn upwards and inwards; and he believes that "when we are wrapt in devotional feelings, and outward impressions are unheeded, the eyes are raised by an action neither taught nor acquired." and that this is due to the same cause as in the above cases.[826] that the eyes are upturned during sleep is, as i hear from professor donders, certain. with babies, whilst sucking their mother's breast, this movement of the eyeballs often gives to them an absurd appearance of ecstatic delight; and here it may be clearly perceived that a struggle is going on against the position naturally assumed during sleep. but sir c. bell's explanation of the fact, which rests on the assumption that certain muscles are more under the control of the will than others is, as i hear from professor donders, incorrect. as the eyes are often turned up in prayer, without the mind being so much absorbed in thought as to approach to the unconsciousness of sleep, the movement is probably a conventional one--the result of the common belief that heaven, the source of divine power to which we pray, is seated above us. a humble kneeling posture, with the hands upturned and palms joined, appears to us, from long habit, a gesture so appropriate to devotion, that it might be thought to be innate; but i have not met with any evidence to this effect with the various extra-european races of mankind. during the classical period of roman history it does not appear, as i hear from an excellent classic, that the hands were thus joined during prayer. mr. rensleigh wedgwood has apparently given[827] the true explanation, though this implies that the attitude is one of slavish subjection. "when the suppliant kneels and holds up his hands with the palms joined, he represents a captive who proves the completeness of his submission by offering up his hands to be bound by the victor. it is the pictorial representation of the latin _dare manus_, to signify submission." hence it is not probable that either the uplifting of the eyes or the joining of the open hands, under the influence of devotional feelings, are innate or truly expressive actions; and this could hardly have been expected, for it is very doubtful whether feelings, such as we should now rank as devotional, affected the hearts of men, whilst they remained during past ages in an uncivilized condition. chapter ix. -- reflection--meditation-ill-temper--sulkiness--determination. the act of frowning--reflection with an effort, or with the perception of something difficult or disagreeable--abstracted meditation--ill-temper--moroseness--obstinacy sulkiness and pouting--decision or determination--the firm closure of the mouth. the corrugators, by their contraction, lower the eyebrows and bring them together, producing vertical furrows on the forehead--that is, a frown. sir c. bell, who erroneously thought that the corrugator was peculiar to man, ranks it as "the most remarkable muscle of the human face. it knits the eyebrows with an energetic effort, which unaccountably, but irresistibly, conveys the idea of mind." or, as he elsewhere says, "when the eyebrows are knit, energy of mind is apparent, and there is the mingling of thought and emotion with the savage and brutal rage of the mere animal."[901] there is much truth in these remarks, but hardly the whole truth. dr. duchenne has called the corrugator the muscle of reflection;[902] but this name, without some limitation, cannot be considered as quite correct. a man may be absorbed in the deepest thought, and his brow will remain smooth until he encounters some obstacle in his train of reasoning, or is interrupted by some disturbance, and then a frown passes like a shadow over his brow. a half-starved man may think intently how to obtain food, but he probably will not frown unless he encounters either in thought or action some difficulty, or finds the food when obtained nauseous. i have noticed that almost everyone instantly frowns if he perceives a strange or bad taste in what he is eating. i asked several persons, without explaining my object, to listen intently to a very gentle tapping sound, the nature and source of which they all perfectly knew, and not one frowned; but a man who joined us, and who could not conceive what we were all doing in profound silence, when asked to listen, frowned much, though not in an ill-temper, and said he could not in the least understand what we all wanted. dr. piderit[903] who has published remarks to the same effect, adds that stammerers generally frown in speaking, and that a man in doing even so trifling a thing as pulling on a boot, frowns if he finds it too tight. some persons are such habitual frowners, that the mere effort of speaking almost always causes their brows to contract. men of all races frown when they are in any way perplexed in thought, as i infer from the answers which i have received to my queries; but i framed them badly, confounding absorbed meditation with perplexed reflection. nevertheless, it is clear that the australians, malays, hindoos, and kafirs of south africa frown, when they are puzzled. dobritzhoffer remarks that the guaranies of south america on like occasions knit their brows.[904] from these considerations, we may conclude that frowning is not the expression of simple reflection, however profound, or of attention, however close, but of something difficult or displeasing encountered in a train of thought or in action. deep reflection can, however, seldom be long carried on without some difficulty, so that it will generally be accompanied by a frown. hence it is that frowning commonly gives to the countenance, as sir c. bell remarks, an aspect of intellectual energy. but in order that this effect may be produced, the eyes must be clear and steady, or they may be cast downwards, as often occurs in deep thought. the countenance must not be otherwise disturbed, as in the case of an ill-tempered or peevish man, or of one who shows the effects of prolonged suffering, with dulled eyes and drooping jaw, or who perceives a bad taste in his food, or who finds it difficult to perform some trifling act, such as threading a needle. in these cases a frown may often be seen, but it will be accompanied by some other expression, which will entirely prevent the countenance having an appearance of intellectual energy or of profound thought. we may now inquire how it is that a frown should express the perception of something difficult or disagreeable, either in thought or action. in the same way as naturalists find it advisable to trace the embryological development of an organ in order fully to understand its structure, so with the movements of expression it is advisable to follow as nearly as possible the same plan. the earliest and almost sole expression seen during the first days of infancy, and then often exhibited is that displayed during the act of screaming; and screaming is excited, both at first and for some time afterwards, by every distressing or displeasing sensation and emotion,--by hunger, pain, anger, jealousy, fear, &c. at such times the muscles round the eyes are strongly contracted; and this, as i believe, explains to a large extent the act of frowning during the remainder of our lives. i repeatedly observed my own infants, from under the age of one week to that of two or three months, and found that when a screaming-fit came on gradually, the first sign was the contraction of the corrugators, which produced a slight frown, quickly followed by the contraction of the other muscles round the eyes. when an infant is uncomfortable or unwell, little frowns--as i record in my notes--may be seen incessantly passing like shadows over its face; these being generally, but not always, followed sooner or later by a crying-fit. for instance, i watched for some time a baby, between seven and eight weeks old, sucking some milk which was cold, and therefore displeasing to him; and a steady little frown was maintained all the time. this was never developed into an actual crying-fit, though occasionally every stage of close approach could be observed. as the habit of contracting the brows has been followed by infants during innumerable generations, at the commencement of every crying or screaming fit, it has become firmly associated with the incipient sense of something distressing or disagreeable. hence under similar circumstances it would be apt to be continued during maturity, although never then developed into a crying-fit. screaming or weeping begins to be voluntarily restrained at an early period of life, whereas frowning is hardly ever restrained at any age. it is perhaps worth notice that with children much given to weeping, anything which perplexes their minds, and which would cause most other children merely to frown, readily makes them weep. so with certain classes of the insane, any effort of mind, however slight, which with an habitual frowner would cause a slight frown, leads to their weeping in an unrestrained manner. it is not more surprising that the habit of contracting the brows at the first perception of something distressing, although gained during infancy, should be retained during the rest of our lives, than that many other associated habits acquired at an early age should be permanently retained both by man and the lower animals. for instance, full-grown cats, when feeling warm and comfortable, often retain the habit of alternately protruding their fore-feet with extended toes, which habit they practised for a definite purpose whilst sucking their mothers. another and distinct cause has probably strengthened the habit of frowning, whenever the mind is intent on any subject and encounters some difficulty. vision is the most important of all the senses, and during primeval times the closest attention must have been incessantly: directed towards distant objects for the sake of obtaining prey and avoiding danger. i remember being struck, whilst travelling in parts of south america, which were dangerous from the presence of indians, how incessantly, yet as it appeared unconsciously, the half-wild gauchos closely scanned the whole horizon. now, when any one with no covering on his head (as must have been aboriginally the case with mankind), strives to the utmost to distinguish in broad daylight, and especially if the sky is bright, a distant object, he almost invariably contracts his brows to prevent the entrance of too much light; the lower eyelids, cheeks, and upper lip being at the same time raised, so as to lessen the orifice of the eyes. i have purposely asked several persons, young and old, to look, under the above circumstances, at distant objects, making them believe that i only wished to test the power of their vision; and they all behaved in the manner just described. some of them, also, put their open, flat hands over their eyes to keep out the excess of light. gratiolet, after making some remarks to nearly the same effect,[905] says, "ce sont la des attitudes de vision difficile." he concludes that the muscles round the eyes contract partly for the sake of excluding too much light (which appears to me the more important end), and partly to prevent all rays striking the retina, except those which come direct from the object that is scrutinized. mr. bowman, whom i consulted on this point, thinks that the contraction of the surrounding muscles may, in addition, "partly sustain the consensual movements of the two eyes, by giving a firmer support while the globes are brought to binocular vision by their own proper muscles." as the effort of viewing with care under a bright light a distant object is both difficult and irksome, and as this effort has been habitually accompanied, during numberless generations, by the contraction of the eyebrows, the habit of frowning will thus have been much strengthened; although it was originally practised during infancy from a quite independent cause, namely as the first step in the protection of the eyes during screaming. there is, indeed, much analogy, as far as the state of the mind is concerned, between intently scrutinizing a distant object, and following out an obscure train of thought, or performing some little and troublesome mechanical work. the belief that the habit of contracting the brows is continued when there is no need whatever to exclude too much light, receives support from the cases formerly alluded to, in which the eyebrows or eyelids are acted on under certain circumstances in a useless manner, from having been similarly used, under analogous circumstances, for a serviceable purpose. for instance, we voluntarily close our eyes when we do not wish to see any object, and we are apt to close them, when we reject a proposition, as if we could not or would not see it; or when we think about something horrible. we raise our eyebrows when we wish to see quickly all round us, and we often do the same, when we earnestly desire to remember something; acting as if we endeavoured to see it. _abstraction. meditation_.--when a person is lost in thought with his mind absent, or, as it is sometimes said, "when he is in a brown study," he does not frown, but his eyes appear vacant. the lower eyelids are generally raised and wrinkled, in the same manner as when a short-sighted person tries to distinguish a distant object; and the upper orbicular muscles are at the same time slightly contracted. the wrinkling of the lower eyelids under these circumstances has been observed with some savages, as by mr. dyson lacy with the australians of queensland, and several times by mr. geach with the malays of the interior of malacca. what the meaning or cause of this action may be, cannot at present be explained; but here we have another instance of movement round the eyes in relation to the state of the mind. the vacant expression of the eyes is very peculiar, and at once shows when a man is completely lost in thought. professor donders has, with his usual kindness, investigated this subject for me. he has observed others in this condition, and has been himself observed by professor engelmann. the eyes are not then fixed on any object, and therefore not, as i had imagined, on some distant object. the lines of vision of the two eyes even often become slightly divergent; the divergence, if the head be held vertically, with the plane of vision horizontal, amounting to an angle of 2'0 as a maximum. this was ascertained by observing the crossed double image of a distant object. when the head droops forward, as often occurs with a man absorbed in thought, owing to the general relaxation of his muscles, if the plane of vision be still horizontal, the eyes are necessarily a little turned upwards, and then the divergence is as much as 3'0, or 3'0 5': if the eyes are turned still more upwards, it amounts to between 6'0 and 7'0. professor donders attributes this divergence to the almost complete relaxation of certain muscles of the eyes, which would be apt to follow from the mind being wholly absorbed.[906] the active condition of the muscles of the eyes is that of convergence; and professor donders remarks, as bearing on their divergence during a period of complete abstraction, that when one eye becomes blind, it almost always, after a short lapse of time, deviates outwards; for its muscles are no longer used in moving the eyeball inwards for the sake of binocular vision. perplexed reflection is often accompanied by certain movements or gestures. at such times we commonly raise our hands to our foreheads, mouths, or chins; but we do not act thus, as far as i have seen, when we are quite lost in meditation, and no difficulty is encountered. plautus, describing in one of his plays[907] a puzzled man, says, "now look, he has pillared his chin upon his hand." even so trifling and apparently unmeaning a gesture as the raising of the hand to the face has been observed with some savages. al. j. mansel weale has seen it with the kafirs of south africa; and the native chief gaika adds, that men then "sometimes pull their beards." mr. washington matthews, who attended to some of the wildest tribes of indians in the western regions of the united states, remarks that he has seen them when concentrating their thoughts, bring their "hands, usually the thumb and index finger, in contact with some part of the face, commonly the upper lip." we can understand why the forehead should be pressed or rubbed, as deep thought tries the brain; but why the hand should be raised to the mouth or face is far from clear. _ill-temper_.--we have seen that frowning is the natural expression of some difficulty encountered, or of something disagreeable experienced either in thought or action, and he whose mind is often and readily affected in this way, will be apt to be ill-tempered, or slightly angry, or peevish, and will commonly show it by frowning. but a cross expression, due to a frown, may be counteracted, if the mouth appears sweet, from being habitually drawn into a smile, and the eyes are bright and cheerful. so it will be if the eye is clear and steady, and there is the appearance of earnest reflection. frowning, with some depression of the corners of the mouth, which is a sign of grief, gives an air of peevishness. if a child (see plate iv., fig. 2)[908] frowns much whilst crying, but does not strongly contract in the usual manner the orbicular muscles, a well-marked expression of anger or even of rage, together with misery, is displayed. [illustration: ill-temper. plate iv] if the whole frowning brow be drawn much downward by the contraction of the pyramidal muscles of the nose, which produces transverse wrinkles or folds across the base of the nose, the expression becomes one of moroseness. duchenne believes that the contraction of this muscle, without any frowning, gives the appearance of extreme and aggressive hardness.[909] but i much doubt whether this is a true or natural expression. i have shown duchenne's photograph of a young man, with this muscle strongly contracted by means of galvanism, to eleven persons, including some artists, and none of them could form an idea what was intended, except one, a girl, who answered correctly, "surely reserve." when i first looked at this photograph, knowing what was intended, my imagination added, as i believe, what was necessary, namely, a frowning brow; and consequently the expression appeared to me true and extremely morose. a firmly closed mouth, in addition to a lowered and frowning brow, gives determination to the expression, or may make it obstinate and sullen. how it comes that the firm closure of the mouth gives the appearance of determination will presently be discussed. an expression of sullen obstinacy has been clearly recognized by my informants, in the natives of six different regions of australia. it is well marked, according to mr. scott, with the hindoos. it has been recognized with the malays, chinese, kafirs, abyssinians, and in a conspicuous degree, according to dr. rothrock, with the wild indians of north america, and according to mr. d. forbes, with the aymaras of bolivia. i have also observed it with the araucanos of southern chili. mr. dyson lacy remarks that the natives of australia, when in this frame of mind, sometimes fold their arms across their breasts, an attitude which may be seen with us. a firm determination, amounting to obstinacy, is, also, sometimes expressed by both shoulders being kept raised, the meaning of which gesture will be explained in the following chapter. with young children sulkiness is shown by pouting, or, as it is sometimes called, "making a snout."[910] when the corners of the mouth are much depressed, the lower lip is a little everted and protruded; and this is likewise called a pout. but the pouting here referred to, consists of the protrusion of both lips into a tubular form, sometimes to such an extent as to project as far as the end of the nose, if this be short. pouting is generally accompanied by frowning, and sometimes by the utterance of a booing or whooing noise. this expression is remarkable, as almost the sole one, as far as i know, which is exhibited much more plainly during childhood, at least with europeans, than during maturity. there is, however, some tendency to the protrusion of the lips with the adults of all races under the influence of great rage. some children pout when they are shy, and they can then hardly be called sulky. from inquiries which i have made in several large families, pouting does not seem very common with european children; but it prevails throughout the world, and must be both common and strongly marked with most savage races, as it has caught the attention of many observers. it has been noticed in eight different districts of australia; and one of my informants remarks how greatly the lips of the children are then protruded. two observers have seen pouting with the children of hindoos; three, with those of the kafirs and fingoes of south africa, and with the hottentots; and two, with the children of the wild indians of north america. pouting has also been observed with the chinese, abyssinians, malays of malacca, dyaks of borneo, and often with the new zealanders. mr. mansel weale informs me that he has seen the lips much protruded, not only with the children of the kafirs, but with the adults of both sexes when sulky; and mr. stack has sometimes observed the same thing with the men, and very frequently with the women of new zealand. a trace of the same expression may occasionally be detected even with adult europeans. we thus see that the protrusion of the lips, especially with young children, is characteristic of sulkiness throughout the greater part of the world. this movement apparently results from the retention, chiefly during youth, of a primordial habit, or from an occasional reversion to it. young orangs and chimpanzees protrude their lips to an extraordinary degree, as described in a former chapter, when they are discontented, somewhat angry, or sulky; also when they are surprised, a little frightened, and even when slightly pleased. their mouths are protruded apparently for the sake of making the various noises proper to these several states of mind; and its shape, as i observed with the chimpanzee, differed slightly when the cry of pleasure and that of anger were uttered. as soon as these animals become enraged, the shape of the month wholly changes, and the teeth are exposed. the adult orang when wounded is said to emit "a singular cry, consisting at first of high notes, which at length deepen into a low roar. while giving out the high notes he thrusts out his lips into a funnel shape, but in uttering the low notes he holds his mouth wide open."[911] with the gorilla, the lower lip is said to be capable of great elongation. if then our semi-human progenitors protruded their lips when sulky or a little angered, in the same manner as do the existing anthropoid apes, it is not an anomalous, though a curious fact, that our children should exhibit, when similarly affected, a trace of the same expression, together with some tendency to utter a noise. for it is not at all unusual for animals to retain, more or less perfectly, during early youth, and subsequently to lose, characters which were aboriginally possessed by their adult progenitors, and which are still retained by distinct species, their near relations. nor is it an anomalous fact that the children of savages should exhibit a stronger tendency to protrude their lips, when sulky, than the children of civilized europeans; for the essence of savagery seems to consist in the retention of a primordial condition, and this occasionally holds good even with bodily peculiarities.[912] it may be objected to this view of the origin of pouting, that the anthropoid apes likewise protrude their lips when astonished and even when a little pleased; whilst with us this expression is generally confined to a sulky frame of mind. but we shall see in a future chapter that with men of various races surprise does sometimes lead to a slight protrusion of the lips, though great surprise or astonishment is more commonly shown by the mouth being widely opened. as when we smile or laugh we draw back the corners of the mouth, we have lost any tendency to protrude the lips, when pleased, if indeed our early progenitors thus expressed pleasure. a little gesture made by sulky children may here be noticed, namely, their "showing a cold shoulder." this has a different meaning, as, i believe, from the keeping both shoulders raised. a cross child, sitting on its parent's knee, will lift up the near shoulder, then jerk it away, as if from a caress, and afterwards give a backward push with it, as if to push away the offender. i have seen a child, standing at some distance from any one, clearly express its feelings by raising one shoulder, giving it a little backward movement, and then turning away its whole body. _decision or determination_.--the firm closure of the mouth tends to give an expression of determination or decision to the countenance. no determined man probably ever had an habitually gaping mouth. hence, also, a small and weak lower jaw, which seems to indicate that the mouth is not habitually and firmly closed, is commonly thought to be characteristic of feebleness of character. a prolonged effort of any kind, whether of body or mind, implies previous determination; and if it can be shown that the mouth is generally closed with firmness before and during a great and continued exertion of the muscular system, then, through the principle of association, the mouth would almost certainly be closed as soon as any determined resolution was taken. now several observers have noticed that a man, in commencing any violent muscular effort, invariably first distends his lungs with air, and then compresses it by the strong contraction of the muscles of the chest; and to effect this the mouth must be firmly closed. moreover, as soon as the man is compelled to draw breath, he still keeps his chest as much distended as possible. various causes have been assigned for this manner of acting. sir c. bell maintains[913] that the chest is distended with air, and is kept distended at such times, in order to give a fixed support to the muscles which are thereto attached. hence, as he remarks, when two men are engaged in a deadly contest, a terrible silence prevails, broken only by hard stifled breathing. there is silence, because to expel the air in the utterance of any sound would be to relax the support for the muscles of the arms. if an outcry is heard, supposing the struggle to take place in the dark, we at once know that one of the two has given up in despair. gratiolet admits[914] that when a man has to struggle with another to his utmost, or has to support a great weight, or to keep for a long time the same forced attitude, it is necessary for him first to make a deep inspiration, and then to cease breathing; but he thinks that sir c. bell's explanation is erroneous. he maintains that arrested respiration retards the circulation of the blood, of which i believe there is no doubt, and he adduces some curious evidence from the structure of the lower animals, showing, on the one hand, that a retarded circulation is necessary for prolonged muscular exertion, and, on the other hand, that a rapid circulation is necessary for rapid movements. according to this view, when we commence any great exertion, we close our mouths and stop breathing, in order to retard the circulation of the blood. gratiolet sums up the subject by saying, "c'est la la vraie theorie de l'effort continu;" but how far this theory is admitted by other physiologists i do not know. dr. piderit accounts[915] for the firm closure of the mouth during strong muscular exertion, on the principle that the influence of the will spreads to other muscles besides those necessarily brought into action in making any particular exertion; and it is natural that the muscles of respiration and of the mouth, from being so habitually used, should be especially liable to be thus acted on. it appears to me that there probably is some truth in this view, for we are apt to press the teeth hard together during violent exertion, and this is not requisite to prevent expiration, whilst the muscles of the chest are strongly contracted. lastly, when a man has to perform some delicate and difficult operation, not requiring the exertion of any strength, he nevertheless generally closes his mouth and ceases for a time to breathe; but he acts thus in order that the movements of his chest may not disturb, those of his arms. a person, for instance, whilst threading a needle, may be seen to compress his lips and either to stop breathing, or to breathe as quietly as possible. so it was, as formerly stated, with a young and sick chimpanzee, whilst it amused itself by killing flies with its knuckles, as they buzzed about on the window-panes. to perform an action, however trifling, if difficult, implies some amount of previous determination. there appears nothing improbable in all the above assigned causes having come into play in different degrees, either conjointly or separately, on various occasions. the result would be a well-established habit, now perhaps inherited, of firmly closing the mouth at the commencement of and during any violent and prolonged exertion, or any delicate operation. through the principle of association there would also be a strong tendency towards this same habit, as soon as the mind had resolved on any particular action or line of conduct, even before there was any bodily exertion, or if none were requisite. the habitual and firm closure of the mouth would thus come to show decision of character; and decision readily passes into obstinacy. chapter x. -- hatred and anger. hatred--rage, effects of on the system--uncovering of the teeth--rage in the insane--anger and indignation--as expressed by the various races of man--sneering and defiance--the uncovering of the canine tooth on one side of the face. if we have suffered or expect to suffer some wilful injury from a man, or if he is in any way offensive to us, we dislike him; and dislike easily rises into hatred. such feelings, if experienced in a moderate degree, are not clearly expressed by any movement of the body or features, excepting perhaps by a certain gravity of behaviour, or by some ill-temper. few individuals, however, can long reflect about a hated person, without feeling and exhibiting signs of indignation or rage. but if the offending person be quite insignificant, we experience merely disdain or contempt. if, on the other hand, he is all-powerful, then hatred passes into terror, as when a slave thinks about a cruel master, or a savage about a bloodthirsty malignant deity.[1001] most of our emotions are so closely connected with their expression, that they hardly exist if the body remains passive--the nature of the expression depending in chief part on the nature of the actions which have been habitually performed under this particular state of the mind. a man, for instance, may know that his life is in the extremest peril, and may strongly desire to save if; yet, as louis xvi. said, when surrounded by a fierce mob, "am i afraid? feel my pulse." so a man may intensely hate another, but until his bodily frame is affected, he cannot be said to be enraged. _rage_.--i have already had occasion to treat of this emotion in the third chapter, when discussing the direct influence of the excited sensorium on the body, in combination with the effects of habitually associated actions. rage exhibits itself in the most diversified manner. the heart and circulation are always affected; the face reddens or becomes purple, with the veins on the forehead and neck distended. the reddening of the skin has been observed with the copper-coloured indians of south america,[1002] and even, as it is said, on the white cicatrices left by old wounds on negroes.[1003] monkeys also redden from passion. with one of my own infants, under four months old, i repeatedly observed that the first symptom of an approaching passion was the rushing of the blood into his bare scalp. on the other hand, the action of the heart is sometimes so much impeded by great rage, that the countenance becomes pallid or livid,[1004] and not a few men with heart-disease have dropped down dead under this powerful emotion. the respiration is likewise affected; the chest heaves, and the dilated nostrils quiver.[1005] as tennyson writes, "sharp breaths of anger puffed her fairy nostrils out." hence we have such expressions as "breathing out vengeance," and "fuming with anger."[1006] the excited brain gives strength to the muscles, and at the same time energy to the will. the body is commonly held erect ready for instant action, but sometimes it is bent forward towards the offending person, with the limbs more or less rigid. the mouth is generally closed with firmness, showing fixed determination, and the teeth are clenched or ground together. such gestures as the raising of the arms, with the fists clenched, as if to strike the offender, are common. few men in a great passion, and telling some one to begone, can resist acting as if they intended to strike or push the man violently away. the desire, indeed, to strike often becomes so intolerably strong, that inanimate objects are struck or dashed to the ground; but the gestures frequently become altogether purposeless or frantic. young children, when in a violent rage roll on the ground on their backs or bellies, screaming, kicking, scratching, or biting everything within reach. so it is, as i hear from mr. scott, with hindoo children; and, as we have seen, with the young of the anthropomorphous apes. but the muscular system is often affected in a wholly different way; for trembling is a frequent consequence of extreme rage. the paralysed lips then refuse to obey the will, "and the voice sticks in the throat;"[1007] or it is rendered loud, harsh, and discordant. if there be much and rapid speaking, the mouth froths. the hair sometimes bristles; but i shall return to this subject in another chapter, when i treat of the mingled emotions of rage and terror. there is in most cases a strongly-marked frown on the forehead; for this follows from the sense of anything displeasing or difficult, together with concentration of mind. but sometimes the brow, instead of being much contracted and lowered, remains smooth, with the glaring eyes kept widely open. the eyes are always bright, or may, as homer expresses it, glisten with fire. they are sometimes bloodshot, and are said to protrude from their sockets--the result, no doubt, of the head being gorged with blood, as shown by the veins being distended. according to gratiolet, "the pupils are always contracted in rage," and i hear from dr. crichton browne that this is the case in the fierce delirium of meningitis; but the movements of the iris under the influence of the different emotions is a very obscure subject. shakspeare sums up the chief characteristics of rage as follows:-- "in peace there's nothing so becomes a man, as modest stillness and humility; but when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger: stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, then lend the eye a terrible aspect; now set the teeth, and stretch the nostril wide, hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit to his full height! on, on, you noblest english." _henry v_., act iii. sc. 1. the lips are sometimes protruded during rage in a manner, the meaning of which i do not understand, unless it depends on our descent from some ape-like animal. instances have been observed, not only with europeans, but with the australians and hindoos. the lips, however, are much more commonly retracted, the grinning or clenched teeth being thus exposed. this has been noticed by almost every one who has written on expression.[1009] the appearance is as if the teeth were uncovered, ready for seizing or tearing an enemy, though there may be no intention of acting in this manner. mr. dyson lacy has seen this grinning expression with the australians, when quarrelling, and so has gaika with the kafirs of south america. dickens,[1010] in speaking of an atrocious murderer who had just been caught, and was surrounded by a furious mob, describes "the people as jumping up one behind another, snarling with their teeth, and making at him like wild beasts." every one who has had much to do with young children must have seen how naturally they take to biting, when in a passion. it seems as instinctive in them as in young crocodiles, who snap their little jaws as soon as they emerge from the egg. a grinning expression and the protrusion of the lips appear sometimes to go together. a close observer says that he has seen many instances of intense hatred (which can hardly be distinguished from rage, more or less suppressed) in orientals, and once in an elderly english woman. in all these cases there "was a grin, not a scowl--the lips lengthening, the cheeks settling downwards, the eyes half-closed, whilst the brow remained perfectly calm."[1011] this retraction of the lips and uncovering of the teeth during paroxysms of rage, as if to bite the offender, is so remarkable, considering how seldom the teeth are used by men in fighting, that i inquired from dr. j. crichton browne whether the habit was common in the insane whose passions are unbridled. he informs me that he has repeatedly observed it both with the insane and idiotic, and has given me the following illustrations:-- shortly before receiving my letter, he witnessed an uncontrollable outbreak of anger and delusive jealousy in an insane lady. at first she vituperated her husband, and whilst doing so foamed at the mouth. next she approached close to him with compressed lips, and a virulent set frown. then she drew back her lips, especially the corners of the upper lip, and showed her teeth, at the same time aiming a vicious blow at him. a second case is that of an old soldier, who, when he is requested to conform to the rules of the establishment, gives way to discontent, terminating in fury. he commonly begins by asking dr. browne whether he is not ashamed to treat him in such a manner. he then swears and blasphemes, paces tip and down, tosses his arms wildly about, and menaces any one near him. at last, as his exasperation culminates, he rushes up towards dr. browne with a peculiar sidelong movement, shaking his doubled fist, and threatening destruction. then his upper lip may be seen to be raised, especially at the corners, so that his huge canine teeth are exhibited. he hisses forth his curses through his set teeth, and his whole expression assumes the character of extreme ferocity. a similar description is applicable to another man, excepting that he generally foams at the mouth and spits, dancing and jumping about in a strange rapid manner, shrieking out his maledictions in a shrill falsetto voice. dr. browne also informs me of the case of an epileptic idiot, incapable of independent movements, and who spends the whole day in playing with some toys; but his temper is morose and easily roused into fierceness. when any one touches his toys, he slowly raises his head from its habitual downward position, and fixes his eyes on the offender, with a tardy yet angry scowl. if the annoyance be repeated, he draws back his thick lips and reveals a prominent row of hideous fangs (large canines being especially noticeable), and then makes a quick and cruel clutch with his open hand at the offending person. the rapidity of this clutch, as dr. browne remarks, is marvellous in a being ordinarily so torpid that he takes about fifteen seconds, when attracted by any noise, to turn his head from one side to the other. if, when thus incensed, a handkerchief, book, or other article, be placed into his hands, he drags it to his mouth and bites it. mr. nicol has likewise described to me two cases of insane patients, whose lips are retracted during paroxysms of rage. dr. maudsley, after detailing various strange animal-like traits in idiots, asks whether these are not due to the reappearance of primitive instincts--"a faint echo from a far-distant past, testifying to a kinship which man has almost outgrown." he adds, that as every human brain passes, in the course of its development, through the same stages as those occurring in the lower vertebrate animals, and as the brain of an idiot is in an arrested condition, we may presume that it "will manifest its most primitive functions, and no higher functions." dr. maudsley thinks that the same view may be extended to the brain in its degenerated condition in some insane patients; and asks, whence come "the savage snarl, the destructive disposition, the obscene language, the wild howl, the offensive habits, displayed by some of the insane? why should a human being, deprived of his reason, ever become so brutal in character, as some do, unless he has the brute nature within him?"[1012] this question must, as it would appear, he answered in the affirmative. _anger, indignation_.--these states of the mind differ from rage only in degree, and there is no marked distinction in their characteristic signs. under moderate anger the action of the heart is a little increased, the colour heightened, and the eyes become bright. the respiration is likewise a little hurried; and as all the muscles serving for this function act in association, the wings of the nostrils are somewhat raised to allow of a free indraught of air; and this is a highly characteristic sign of indignation. the mouth is commonly compressed, and there is almost always a frown on the brow. instead of the frantic gestures of extreme rage, an indignant man unconsciously throws himself into an attitude ready for attacking or striking his enemy, whom he will perhaps scan from head to foot in defiance. he carries his head erect, with his chest well expanded, and the feet planted firmly on the ground. he holds his arms in various positions, with one or both elbows squared, or with the arms rigidly suspended by his sides. with europeans the fists are commonly clenched.[1013] the figures 1 and 2 in plate vi. are fairly good representations of men simulating indignation. any one may see in a mirror, if he will vividly imagine that he has been insulted and demands an explanation in an angry tone of voice, that he suddenly and unconsciously throws himself into some such attitude. [illustration: anger and indignation. plate vi] rage, anger, and indignation are exhibited in nearly the same manner throughout the world; and the following descriptions may be worth giving as evidence of this, and as illustrations of some of the foregoing remarks. there is, however, an exception with respect to clenching the fists, which seems confined chiefly to the men who fight with their fists. with the australians only one of my informants has seen the fists clenched. all agree about the body being held erect; and all, with two exceptions, state that the brows are heavily contracted. some of them allude to the firmly-compressed mouth, the distended nostrils, and flashing eyes. according to the rev. mr. taplin, rage, with the australians, is expressed by the lips being protruded, the eyes being widely open; and in the case of the women by their dancing about and casting dust into the air. another observer speaks of the native men, when enraged, throwing their arms wildly about. i have received similar accounts, except as to the clenching of the fists, in regard to the malays of the malacca peninsula, the abyssinians, and the natives of south africa. so it is with the dakota indians of north america; and, according to mr. matthews, they then hold their heads erect, frown, and often stalk away with long strides. mr. bridges states that the fuegians, when enraged, frequently stamp on the ground, walk distractedly about, sometimes cry and grow pale. the rev. mr. stack watched a new zealand man and woman quarrelling, and made the following entry in his note-book: "eyes dilated, body swayed violently backwards and forwards, head inclined forwards, fists clenched, now thrown behind the body, now directed towards each other's faces." mr. swinhoe says that my description agrees with what he has seen of the chinese, excepting that an angry man generally inclines his body towards his antagonist, and pointing at him, pours forth a volley of abuse. lastly, with respect to the natives of india, mr. j. scott has sent me a full description of their gestures and expression when enraged. two low-caste bengalees disputed about a loan. at first they were calm, but soon grew furious and poured forth the grossest abuse on each other's relations and progenitors for many generations past. their gestures were very different from those of europeans; for though their chests were expanded and shoulders squared, their arms remained rigidly suspended, with the elbows turned inwards and the hands alternately clenched and opened. their shoulders were often raised high, and then again lowered. they looked fiercely at each other from under their lowered and strongly wrinkled brows, and their protruded lips were firmly closed. they approached each other, with heads and necks stretched forwards, and pushed, scratched, and grasped at each other. this protrusion of the head and body seems a common gesture with the enraged; and i have noticed it with degraded english women whilst quarrelling violently in the streets. in such cases it may be presumed that neither party expects to receive a blow from the other. a bengalee employed in the botanic gardens was accused, in the presence of mr. scott, by the native overseer of having stolen a valuable plant. he listened silently and scornfully to the accusation; his attitude erect, chest expanded, mouth closed, lips protruding, eyes firmly set and penetrating. he then defiantly maintained his innocence, with upraised and clenched hands, his head being now pushed forwards, with the eyes widely open and eyebrows raised. mr. scott also watched two mechis, in sikhim, quarrelling about their share of payment. they soon got into a furious passion, and then their bodies became less erect, with their heads pushed forwards; they made grimaces at each other; their shoulders were raised; their arms rigidly bent inwards at the elbows, and their hands spasmodically closed, but not properly clenched. they continually approached and retreated from each other, and often raised their arms as if to strike, but their hands were open, and no blow was given. mr. scott made similar observations on the lepchas whom he often saw quarrelling, and he noticed that they kept their arms rigid and almost parallel to their bodies, with the hands pushed somewhat backwards and partially closed, but not clenched. _sneering, defiance: uncovering the canine tooth on one side_.--the expression which i wish here to consider differs but little from that already described, when the lips are retracted and the grinning teeth exposed. the difference consists solely in the upper lip being retracted in such a manner that the canine tooth on one side of the face alone is shown; the face itself being generally a little upturned and half averted from the person causing offence. the other signs of rage are not necessarily present. this expression may occasionally be observed in a person who sneers at or defies another, though there may be no real anger; as when any one is playfully accused of some fault, and answers, "i scorn the imputation." the expression is not a common one, but i have seen it exhibited with perfect distinctness by a lady who was being quizzed by another person. it was described by parsons as long ago as 1746, with an engraving, showing the uncovered canine on one side.[1014] mr. rejlander, without my having made any allusion to the subject, asked me whether i had ever noticed this expression, as he had been much struck by it. he has photographed for me (plate iv. fig 1) a lady, who sometimes unintentionally displays the canine on one side, and who can do so voluntarily with unusual distinctness. the expression of a half-playful sneer graduates into one of great ferocity when, together with a heavily frowning brow and fierce eye, the canine tooth is exposed. a bengalee boy was accused before mr. scott of some misdeed. the delinquent did not dare to give vent to his wrath in words, but it was plainly shown on his countenance, sometimes by a defiant frown, and sometimes "by a thoroughly canine snarl." when this was exhibited, "the corner of the lip over the eye-tooth, which happened in this case to be large and projecting, was raised on the side of his accuser, a strong frown being still retained on the brow." sir c. bell states[1015] that the actor cooke could express the most determined hate "when with the oblique cast of his eyes he drew up the outer part of the upper lip, and discovered a sharp angular tooth." the uncovering of the canine tooth is the result of a double movement. the angle or corner of the mouth is drawn a little backwards, and at the same time a muscle which runs parallel to and near the nose draws up the outer part of the upper lip, and exposes the canine on this side of the face. the contraction of this muscle makes a distinct furrow on the cheek, and produces strong wrinkles under the eye, especially at its inner corner. the action is the same as that of a snarling dog; and a dog when pretending to fight often draws up the lip on one side alone, namely that facing his antagonist. our word _sneer_ is in fact the same as _snarl_, which was originally _snar_, the _l_ "being merely an element implying continuance of action."[1016] i suspect that we see a trace of this same expression in what is called a derisive or sardonic smile. the lips are then kept joined or almost joined, but one corner of the mouth is retracted on the side towards the derided person; and this drawing back of the corner is part of a true sneer. although some persons smile more on one side of their face than on the other, it is not easy to understand why in cases of derision the smile, if a real one, should so commonly be confined to one side. i have also on these occasions noticed a slight twitching of the muscle which draws up the outer part of the upper lip; and this movement, if fully carried out, would have uncovered the canine, and would have produced a true sneer. mr. bulmer, an australian missionary in a remote part of gipps' land, says, in answer to my query about the uncovering of the canine on one side, "i find that the natives in snarling at each other speak with the teeth closed, the upper lip drawn to one side, and a general angry expression of face; but they look direct at the person addressed." three other observers in australia, one in abyssinia, and one in china, answer my query on this head in the affirmative; but as the expression is rare, and as they enter into no details, i am afraid of implicitly trusting them. it is, however, by no means improbable that this animal-like expression may be more common with savages than with civilized races. mr. geach is an observer who may be fully trusted, and he has observed it on one occasion in a malay in the interior of malacca. the rev. s. o. glenie answers, "we have observed this expression with the natives of ceylon, but not often." lastly, in north america, dr. rothrock has seen it with some wild indians, and often in a tribe adjoining the atnahs. although the upper lip is certainly sometimes raised on one side alone in sneering at or defying any one, i do not know that this is always the case, for the face is commonly half averted, and the expression is often momentary. the movement being confined to one side may not be an essential part of the expression, but may depend on the proper muscles being incapable of movement excepting on one side. i asked four persons to endeavour to act voluntarily in this manner; two could expose the canine only on the left side, one only on the right side, and the fourth on neither side. nevertheless it is by no means certain that these same persons, if defying any one in earnest, would not unconsciously have uncovered their canine tooth on the side, whichever it might be, towards the offender. for we have seen that some persons cannot voluntarily make their eyebrows oblique, yet instantly act in this manner when affected by any real, although most trifling, cause of distress. the power of voluntarily uncovering the canine on one side of the face being thus often wholly lost, indicates that it is a rarely used and almost abortive action. it is indeed a surprising fact that man should possess the power, or should exhibit any tendency to its use; for mr. sutton has never noticed a snarling action in our nearest allies, namely, the monkeys in the zoological gardens, and he is positive that the baboons, though furnished with great canines, never act thus, but uncover all their teeth when feeling savage and ready for an attack. whether the adult anthropomorphous apes, in the males of whom the canines are much larger than in the females, uncover them when prepared to fight, is not known. the expression here considered, whether that of a playful sneer or ferocious snarl, is one of the most curious which occurs in man. it reveals his animal descent; for no one, even if rolling on the ground in a deadly grapple with an enemy, and attempting to bite him, would try to use his canine teeth more than his other teeth. we may readily believe from our affinity to the anthropomorphous apes that our male semi-human progenitors possessed great canine teeth, and men are now occasionally born having them of unusually large size, with interspaces in the opposite jaw for their reception.[1017] we may further suspect, notwithstanding that we have no support from analogy, that our semi-human progenitors uncovered their canine teeth when prepared for battle, as we still do when feeling ferocious, or when merely sneering at or defying some one, without any intention of making a real attack with our teeth. chapter xi. -- disdain--contempt--disgust-guilt--pride, etc.--helplessness--patience--affirmation and negation. contempt, scorn and disdain, variously expressed--derisive smile--gestures expressive of contempt--disgust--guilt, deceit, pride, &c.--helplessness or impotence--patience--obstinacy--shrugging the shoulders common to most of the races of man--signs of affirmation and negation. scorn and disdain can hardly be distinguished from contempt, excepting that they imply a rather more angry frame of mind. nor can they be clearly distinguished from the feelings discussed in the last chapter under the terms of sneering and defiance. disgust is a sensation rather more distinct in its nature and refers to something revolting, primarily in relation to the sense of taste, as actually perceived or vividly imagined; and secondarily to anything which causes a similar feeling, through the sense of smell, touch, and even of eyesight. nevertheless, extreme contempt, or as it is often called loathing contempt, hardly differs from disgust. these several conditions of the mind are, therefore, nearly related; and each of them may be exhibited in many different ways. some writers have insisted chiefly on one mode of expression, and others on a different mode. from this circumstance m. lemoine has argued[1101] that their descriptions are not trustworthy. but we shall immediately see that it is natural that the feelings which we have here to consider should be expressed in many different ways, inasmuch as various habitual actions serve equally well, through the principle of association, for their expression. scorn and disdain, as well as sneering and defiance, may be displayed by a slight uncovering of the canine tooth on one side of the face; and this movement appears to graduate into one closely like a smile. or the smile or laugh may be real, although one of derision; and this implies that the offender is so insignificant that he excites only amusement; but the amusement is generally a pretence. gaika in his answers to my queries remarks, that contempt is commonly shown by his countrymen, the kafirs, by smiling; and the rajah brooke makes the same observation with respect to the dyaks of borneo. as laughter is primarily the expression of simple joy, very young children do not, i believe, ever laugh in derision. the partial closure of the eyelids, as duchenne[1102] insists, or the turning away of the eyes or of the whole body, are likewise highly expressive of disdain. these actions seem to declare that the despised person is not worth looking at or is disagreeable to behold. the accompanying photograph (plate v. fig. 1) by mr. rejlander, shows this form of disdain. it represents a young lady, who is supposed to be tearing up the photograph of a despised lover. [illustration: scorn and disdain. plate v] the most common method of expressing contempt is by movements about the nose, or round the mouth; but the latter movements, when strongly pronounced, indicate disgust. the nose may be slightly turned up, which apparently follows from the turning up of the upper lip; or the movement may be abbreviated into the mere wrinkling of the nose. the nose is often slightly contracted, so as partly to close the passage;[1103] and this is commonly accompanied by a slight snort or expiration. all these actions are the same with those which we employ when we perceive an offensive odour, and wish to exclude or expel it. in extreme cases, as dr. piderit remarks,[1104] we protrude and raise both lips, or the upper lip alone, so as to close the nostrils as by a valve, the nose being thus turned up. we seem thus to say to the despised person that he smells offensively,[1105] in nearly the same manner as we express to him by half-closing our eyelids, or turning away our faces, that he is not worth looking at. it must not, however, be supposed that such ideas actually pass through the mind when we exhibit our contempt; but as whenever we have perceived a disagreeable odour or seen a disagreeable sight, actions of this kind have been performed, they have become habitual or fixed, and are now employed under any analogous state of mind. various odd little gestures likewise indicate contempt; for instance, _snapping one's fingers_. this, as mr. taylor remarks,[1106] "is not very intelligible as we generally see it; but when we notice that the same sign made quite gently, as if rolling some tiny object away between the finger and thumb, or the sign of flipping it away with the thumb-nail and forefinger, are usual and well-understood deaf-and-dumb gestures, denoting anything tiny, insignificant, contemptible, it seems as though we had exaggerated and conventionalized a perfectly natural action, so as to lose sight of its original meaning. there is a curious mention of this gesture by strabo." mr. washington matthews informs me that, with the dakota indians of north america, contempt is shown not only by movements of the face, such as those above described, but "conventionally, by the hand being closed and held near the breast, then, as the forearm is suddenly extended, the hand is opened and the fingers separated from each other. if the person at whose expense the sign is made is present, the hand is moved towards him, and the head sometimes averted from him." this sudden extension and opening of the hand perhaps indicates the dropping or throwing away a valueless object. the term 'disgust,' in its simplest sense, means something offensive to the taste. it is curious how readily this feeling is excited by anything unusual in the appearance, odour, or nature of our food. in tierra del fuego a native touched with his finger some cold preserved meat which i was eating at our bivouac, and plainly showed utter disgust at its softness; whilst i felt utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage, though his hands did not appear dirty. a smear of soup on a man's beard looks disgusting, though there is of course nothing disgusting in the soup itself. i presume that this follows from the strong association in our minds between the sight of food, however circumstanced, and the idea of eating it. as the sensation of disgust primarily arises in connection with the act of eating or tasting, it is natural that its expression should consist chiefly in movements round the mouth. but as disgust also causes annoyance, it is generally accompanied by a frown, and often by gestures as if to push away or to guard oneself against the offensive object. in the two photographs (figs. 2 and 3, on plate v.) mr. rejlander has simulated this expression with some success. with respect to the face, moderate disgust is exhibited in various ways; by the mouth being widely opened, as if to let an offensive morsel drop out; by spitting; by blowing out of the protruded lips; or by a sound as of clearing the throat. such guttural sounds are written _ach_ or _ugh_; and their utterance is sometimes accompanied by a shudder, the arms being pressed close to the sides and the shoulders raised in the same manner as when horror is experienced.[1107] extreme disgust is expressed by movements round the month identical with those preparatory to the act of vomiting. the mouth is opened widely, with the upper lip strongly retracted, which wrinkles the sides of the nose, and with the lower lip protruded and everted as much as possible. this latter movement requires the contraction of the muscles which draw downwards the corners of the mouth.[1108] it is remarkable how readily and instantly retching or actual vomiting is induced in some persons by the mere idea of having partaken of any unusual food, as of an animal which is not commonly eaten; although there is nothing in such food to cause the stomach to reject it. when vomiting results, as a reflex action, from some real cause--as from too rich food, or tainted meat, or from an emetic--it does not ensue immediately, but generally after a considerable interval of time. therefore, to account for retching or vomiting being so quickly and easily excited by a mere idea, the suspicion arises that our progenitors must formerly have had the power (like that possessed by ruminants and some other animals) of voluntarily rejecting food which disagreed with them, or which they thought would disagree with them; and now, though this power has been lost, as far as the will is concerned, it is called into involuntary action, through the force of a formerly well-established habit, whenever the mind revolts at the idea of having partaken of any kind of food, or at anything disgusting. this suspicion receives support from the fact, of which i am assured by mr. sutton, that the monkeys in the zoological gardens often vomit whilst in perfect health, which looks as if the act were voluntary. we can see that as man is able to communicate by language to his children and others, the knowledge of the kinds of food to be avoided, he would have little occasion to use the faculty of voluntary rejection; so that this power would tend to be lost through disuse. as the sense of smell is so intimately connected with that of taste, it is not surprising that an excessively bad odour should excite retching or vomiting in some persons, quite as readily as the thought of revolting food does; and that, as a further consequence, a moderately offensive odour should cause the various expressive movements of disgust. the tendency to retch from a fetid odour is immediately strengthened in a curious manner by some degree of habit, though soon lost by longer familiarity with the cause of offence and by voluntary restraint. for instance, i wished to clean the skeleton of a bird, which had not been sufficiently macerated, and the smell made my servant and myself (we not having had much experience in such work) retch so violently, that we were compelled to desist. during the previous days i had examined some other skeletons, which smelt slightly; yet the odour did not in the least affect me, but, subsequently for several days, whenever i handled these same skeletons, they made me retch. from the answers received from my correspondents it appears that the various movements, which have now been described as expressing contempt and disgust, prevail throughout a large part of the world. dr. rothrock, for instance, answers with a decided affirmative with respect to certain wild indian tribes of north america. crantz says that when a greenlander denies anything with contempt or horror he turns up his nose, and gives a slight sound through it.[1109] mr. scott has sent me a graphic description of the face of a young hindoo at the sight of castor-oil, which he was compelled occasionally to take. mr. scott has also seen the same expression on the faces of high-caste natives who have approached close to some defiling object. mr. bridges says that the fuegians "express contempt by shooting out the lips and hissing through them, and by turning up the nose." the tendency either to snort through the nose, or to make a noise expressed by _ugh_ or _ach_, is noticed by several of my correspondents. spitting seems an almost universal sign of contempt or disgust; and spitting obviously represents the rejection of anything offensive from the mouth. shakspeare makes the duke of norfolk say, "i spit at him--call him a slanderous coward and a villain." so, again, falstaff says, "tell thee what, hal,--if i tell thee a lie, spit in my face." leichhardt remarks that the australians "interrupted their speeches by spitting, and uttering a noise like pooh! pooh! apparently expressive of their disgust." and captain burton speaks of certain negroes "spitting with disgust upon the ground." captain speedy informs me that this is likewise the case with the abyssinians. mr. geach says that with the malays of malacca the expression of disgust "answers to spitting from the mouth;" and with the fuegians, according to mr. bridges "to spit at one is the highest mark of contempt." i never saw disgust more plainly expressed than on the face of one of my infants at the age of five months, when, for the first time, some cold water, and again a month afterwards, when a piece of ripe cherry was put into his mouth. this was shown by the lips and whole mouth assuming a shape which allowed the contents to run or fall quickly out; the tongue being likewise protruded. these movements were accompanied by a little shudder. it was all the more comical, as i doubt whether the child felt real disgust--the eyes and forehead expressing much surprise and consideration. the protrusion of the tongue in letting a nasty object fall out of the mouth, may explain how it is that lolling out the tongue universally serves as a sign of contempt and hatred.[1111] we have now seen that scorn, disdain, contempt, and disgust are expressed in many different ways, by movements of the features, and by various gestures; and that these are the same throughout the world. they all consist of actions representing the rejection or exclusion of some real object which we dislike or abhor, but which does not excite in us certain other strong emotions, such as rage or terror; and through the force of habit and association similar actions are performed, whenever any analogous sensation arises in our minds. _jealousy, envy, avarice, revenge, suspicion, deceit, slyness, guilt, vanity, conceit, ambition, pride, humility, &c_.--it is doubtful whether the greater number of the above complex states of mind are revealed by any fixed expression, sufficiently distinct to be described or delineated. when shakspeare speaks of envy as _lean-faced_, or _black_, or _pale_, and jealousy as "_the green-eyed monster_;" and when spenser describes suspicion as "_foul, ill-favoured, and grim_," they must have felt this difficulty. nevertheless, the above feelings--at least many of them--can be detected by the eye; for instance, conceit; but we are often guided in a much greater degree than we suppose by our previous knowledge of the persons or circumstances. my correspondents almost unanimously answer in the affirmative to my query, whether the expression of guilt and deceit can be recognized amongst the various races of man; and i have confidence in their answers, as they generally deny that jealousy can thus be recognized. in the cases in which details are given, the eyes are almost always referred to. the guilty man is said to avoid looking at his accuser, or to give him stolen looks. the eyes are said "to be turned askant," or "to waver from side to side," or "the eyelids to be lowered and partly closed." this latter remark is made by mr. hagenauer with respect to the australians, and by gaika with respect to the kafirs. the restless movements of the eyes apparently follow, as will be explained when we treat of blushing, from the guilty man not enduring to meet the gaze of his accuser. i may add, that i have observed a guilty expression, without a shade of fear, in some of my own children at a very early age. in one instance the expression was unmistakably clear in a child two years and seven months old, and led to the detection of his little crime. it was shown, as i record in my notes made at the time, by an unnatural brightness in the eyes, and by an odd, affected manner, impossible to describe. slyness is also, i believe, exhibited chiefly by movements about the eyes; for these are less under the control of the will, owing to the force of long-continued habit, than are the movements of the body. mr. herbert spencer remarks,[1112] "when there is a desire to see something on one side of the visual field without being supposed to see it, the tendency is to check the conspicuous movement of the head, and to make the required adjustment entirely with the eyes; which are, therefore, drawn very much to one side. hence, when the eyes are turned to one side, while the face is not turned to the same side, we get the natural language of what is called slyness." of all the above-named complex emotions, pride, perhaps, is the most plainly expressed. a proud man exhibits his sense of superiority over others by holding his head and body erect. he is haughty (_haut_), or high, and makes himself appear as large as possible; so that metaphorically he is said to be swollen or puffed up with pride. a peacock or a turkey-cock strutting about with puffed-up feathers, is sometimes said to be an emblem of pride.[1113] the arrogant man looks down on others, and with lowered eyelids hardly condescends to see them; or he may show his contempt by slight movements, such as those before described, about the nostrils or lips. hence the muscle which everts the lower lip has been called the _musculus superbus_. in some photographs of patients affected by a monomania of pride, sent me by dr. crichton browne, the head and body were held erect, and the mouth firmly closed. this latter action, expressive of decision, follows, i presume, from the proud man feeling perfect self-confidence in himself. the whole expression of pride stands in direct antithesis to that of humility; so that nothing need here be said of the latter state of mind. _helplessness, impotence: shrugging the shoulders_.--when a man wishes to show that he cannot do something, or prevent something being done, he often raises with a quick movement both shoulders. at the same time, if the whole gesture is completed, he bends his elbows closely inwards, raises his open hands, turning them outwards, with the fingers separated. the head is often thrown a little on one side; the eyebrows are elevated, and this causes wrinkles across the forehead. the mouth is generally opened. i may mention, in order to show how unconsciously the features are thus acted on, that though i had often intentionally shrugged my shoulders to observe how my arms were placed, i was not at all aware that my eyebrows were raised and mouth opened, until i looked at myself in a glass; and since then i have noticed the same movements in the faces of others. in the accompanying plate vi., figs. 3 and 4, mr. rejlander has successfully acted the gesture of shrugging the shoulders. englishmen are much less demonstrative than the men of most other european nations, and they shrug their shoulders far less frequently and energetically than frenchmen or italians do. the gesture varies in all degrees from the complex movement, just described, to only a momentary and scarcely perceptible raising of both shoulders; or, as i have noticed in a lady sitting in an arm-chair, to the mere turning slightly outwards of the open hands with separated fingers. i have never seen very young english children shrug their shoulders, but the following case was observed with care by a medical professor and excellent observer, and has been communicated to me by him. the father of this gentleman was a parisian, and his mother a scotch lady. his wife is of british extraction on both sides, and my informant does not believe that she ever shrugged her shoulders in her life. his children have been reared in england, and the nursemaid is a thorough englishwoman, who has never been seen to shrug her shoulders. now, his eldest daughter was observed to shrug her shoulders at the age of between sixteen and eighteen months; her mother exclaiming at the time, "look at the little french girl shrugging her shoulders!" at first she often acted thus, sometimes throwing her head a little backwards and on one side, but she did not, as far as was observed, move her elbows and hands in the usual manner. the habit gradually wore away, and now, when she is a little over four years old, she is never seen to act thus. the father is told that he sometimes shrugs his shoulders, especially when arguing with any one; but it is extremely improbable that his daughter should have imitated him at so early an age; for, as he remarks, she could not possibly have often seen this gesture in him. moreover, if the habit had been acquired through imitation, it is not probable that it would so soon have been spontaneously discontinued by this child, and, as we shall immediately see, by a second child, though the father still lived with his family. this little girl, it may be added, resembles her parisian grandfather in countenance to an almost absurd degree. she also presents another and very curious resemblance to him, namely, by practising a singular trick. when she impatiently wants something, she holds out her little hand, and rapidly rubs the thumb against the index and middle finger: now this same trick was frequently performed under the same circumstances by her grandfather. this gentleman's second daughter also shrugged her shoulders before the age of eighteen months, and afterwards discontinued the habit. it is of course possible that she may have imitated her elder sister; but she continued it after her sister had lost the habit. she at first resembled her parisian grandfather in a less degree than did her sister at the same age, but now in a greater degree. she likewise practises to the present time the peculiar habit of rubbing together, when impatient, her thumb and two of her fore-fingers. in this latter case we have a good instance, like those given in a former chapter, of the inheritance of a trick or gesture; for no one, i presume, will attribute to mere coincidence so peculiar a habit as this, which was common to the grandfather and his two grandchildren who had never seen him. considering all the circumstances with reference to these children shrugging their shoulders, it can hardly be doubted that they have inherited the habit from their french progenitors, although they have only one quarter french blood in their veins, and although their grandfather did not often shrug his shoulders. there is nothing very unusual, though the fact is interesting, in these children having gained by inheritance a habit during early youth, and then discontinuing it; for it is of frequent occurrence with many kinds of animals that certain characters are retained for a period by the young, and are then lost. as it appeared to me at one time improbable in a high degree that so complex a gesture as shrugging the shoulders, together with the accompanying movements, should be innate, i was anxious to ascertain whether the blind and deaf laura bridgman, who could not have learnt the habit by imitation, practised it. and i have heard, through dr. innes, from a lady who has lately had charge of her, that she does shrug her shoulders, turn in her elbows, and raise her eyebrows in the same manner as other people, and under the same circumstances. i was also anxious to learn whether this gesture was practised by the various races of man, especially by those who never have had much intercourse with europeans. we shall see that they act in this manner; but it appears that the gesture is sometimes confined to merely raising or shrugging the shoulders, without the other movements. mr. scott has frequently seen this gesture in the bengalees and dhangars (the latter constituting a distinct race) who are employed in the botanic garden at calcutta; when, for instance, they have declared that they could not do some work, such as lifting a heavy weight. he ordered a bengalee to climb a lofty tree; but the man, with a shrug of his shoulders and a lateral shake of his head, said he could not. mr. scott knowing that the man was lazy, thought he could, and insisted on his trying. his face now became pale, his arms dropped to his sides, his mouth and eyes were widely opened, and again surveying the tree, he looked askant at mr. scott, shrugged his shoulders, inverted his elbows, extended his open hands, and with a few quick lateral shakes of the head declared his inability. mr. h. erskine has likewise seen the natives of india shrugging their shoulders; but he has never seen the elbows turned so much inwards as with us; and whilst shrugging their shoulders they sometimes lay their uncrossed hands on their breasts. with the wild malays of the interior of malacca, and with the bugis (true malays, though speaking a different, language), mr. geach has often seen this gesture. i presume that it is complete, as, in answer to my query descriptive of the movements of the shoulders, arms, hands, and face, mr. geach remarks, "it is performed in a beautiful style." i have lost an extract from a scientific voyage, in which shrugging the shoulders by some natives (micronesians) of the caroline archipelago in the pacific ocean, was well described. capt. speedy informs me that the abyssinians shrug their shoulders but enters into no details. mrs. asa gray saw an arab dragoman in alexandria acting exactly as described in my query, when an old gentleman, on whom he attended, would not go in the proper direction which had been pointed out to him. mr. washington matthews says, in reference to the wild indian tribes of the western parts of the united states, "i have on a few occasions detected men using a slight apologetic shrug, but the rest of the demonstration which you describe i have not witnessed." fritz muller informs me that he has seen the negroes in brazil shrugging their shoulders; but it is of course possible that they may have learnt to do so by imitating the portuguese. mrs. barber has never seen this gesture with the kafirs of south africa; and gaika, judging from his answer, did not even understand what was meant by my description. mr. swinhoe is also doubtful about the chinese; but he has seen them, under the circumstances which would make us shrug our shoulders, press their right elbow against their side, raise their eyebrows, lift up their hand with the palm directed towards the person addressed, and shake it from right to left. lastly, with respect to the australians, four of my informants answer by a simple negative, and one by a simple affirmative. mr. bunnett, who has had excellent opportunities for observation on the borders of the colony of victory, also answers by a "yes," adding that the gesture is performed "in a more subdued and less demonstrative manner than is the case with civilized nations." this circumstance may account for its not having been noticed by four of my informants. these statements, relating to europeans, hindoos, the hill-tribes of india, malays, micronesians, abyssinians, arabs, negroes, indians of north america, and apparently to the australians--many of these natives having had scarcely any intercourse with europeans--are sufficient to show that shrugging the shoulders, accompanied in some cases by the other proper movements, is a gesture natural to mankind. this gesture implies an unintentional or unavoidable action on our own part, or one that we cannot perform; or an action performed by another person which we cannot prevent. it accompanies such speeches as, "it was not my fault;" "it is impossible for me to grant this favour;" "he must follow his own course, i cannot stop him." shrugging the shoulders likewise expresses patience, or the absence of any intention to resist. hence the muscles which raise the shoulders are sometimes called, as i have been informed by an artist, the patience muscles. shylock the jew, says, "signor antonio, many a time and oft in the rialto have you rated me about my monies and usances; still have i borne it with a patient shrug." _merchant of venice_, act 1. sc. 3. sir c. bell has given[1114] a life-like figure of a man, who is shrinking back from some terrible danger, and is on the point of screaming out in abject terror. he is represented with his shoulders lifted up almost to his ears; and this at once declares that there is no thought of resistance. as shrugging the shoulders generally implies "i cannot do this or that," so by a slight change, it sometimes implies "i won't do it." the movement then expresses a dogged determination not to act. olmsted describes[1115] an indian in texas as giving a great shrug to his shoulders, when he was informed that a party of men were germans and not americans, thus expressing that he would have nothing to do with them. sulky and obstinate children may be seen with both their shoulders raised high up; but this movement is not associated with the others which generally accompany a true shrug. an excellent observer[1116] in describing a young man who was determined not to yield to his father's desire, says, "he thrust his hands deep down into his pockets, and set up his shoulders to his ears, which was a good warning that, come right or wrong, this rock should fly from its firm base as soon as jack would; and that any remonstrance on the subject was purely futile." as soon as the son got his own way, he "put his shoulders into their natural position." resignation is sometimes shown by the open hands being placed, one over the other, on the lower part of the body. i should not have thought this little gesture worth even a passing notice, had not dr. w. ogle remarked to me that he had two or three times observed it in patients who were preparing for operations under chloroform. they exhibited no great fear, but seemed to declare by this posture of their hands, that they had made up their minds, and were resigned to the inevitable. we may now inquire why men in all parts of the world when they feel,--whether or not they wish to show this feeling,--that they cannot or will not do something, or will not resist something if done by another, shrug their shoulders, at the same time often bending in their elbows, showing the palms of their hands with extended fingers, often throwing their heads a little on one side, raising their eyebrows, and opening their mouths. these states of the mind are either simply passive, or show a determination not to act. none of the above movements are of the least service. the explanation lies, i cannot doubt, in the principle of unconscious antithesis. this principle here seems to come into play as clearly as in the case of a dog, who, when feeling savage, puts himself in the proper attitude for attacking and for making himself appear terrible to his enemy; but as soon as he feels affectionate, throws his whole body into a directly opposite attitude, though this is of no direct use to him. let it be observed how an indignant man, who resents, and will not submit to some injury, holds his head erect, squares his shoulders, and expands his chest. he often clenches his fists, and puts one or both arms in the proper position for attack or defence, with the muscles of his limbs rigid. he frowns,--that is, he contracts and lowers his brows,--and, being determined, closes his mouth. the actions and attitude of a helpless man are, in every one of these respects, exactly the reverse. in plate vi. we may imagine one of the figures on the left side to have just said, "what do you mean by insulting me?" and one of the figures on the right side to answer, "i really could not help it." the helpless man unconsciously contracts the muscles of his forehead which are antagonistic to those that cause a frown, and thus raises his eyebrows; at the same time he relaxes the muscles about the mouth, so that the lower jaw drops. the antithesis is complete in every detail, not only in the movements of the features, but in the position of the limbs and in the attitude of the whole body, as may be seen in the accompanying plate. as the helpless or apologetic man often wishes to show his state of mind, he then acts in a conspicuous or demonstrative manner. in accordance with the fact that squaring the elbows and clenching the fists are gestures by no means universal with the men of all races, when they feel indignant and are prepared to attack their enemy, so it appears that a helpless or apologetic frame of mind is expressed in many parts of the world by merely shrugging the shoulders, without turning inwards the elbows and opening the hands. the man or child who is obstinate, or one who is resigned to some great misfortune, has in neither case any idea of resistance by active means; and he expresses this state of mind, by simply keeping his shoulders raised; or he may possibly fold his arms across his breast. _signs of affirmation or approval, and of negation or disapproval: nodding and shaking the head_.--i was curious to ascertain how far the common signs used by us in affirmation and negation were general throughout the world. these signs are indeed to a certain extent expressive of our feelings, as we give a vertical nod of approval with a smile to our children, when we approve of their conduct; and shake our heads laterally with a frown, when we disapprove. with infants, the first act of denial consists in refusing food; and i repeatedly noticed with my own infants, that they did so by withdrawing their heads laterally from the breast, or from anything offered them in a spoon. in accepting food and taking it into their mouths, they incline their heads forwards. since making these observations i have been informed that the same idea had occurred to charma.[1117] it deserves notice that in accepting or taking food, there is only a single movement forward, and a single nod implies an affirmation. on the other hand, in refusing food, especially if it be pressed on them, children frequently move their heads several times from side to side, as we do in shaking our heads in negation. moreover, in the case of refusal, the head is not rarely thrown backwards, or the mouth is closed, so that these movements might likewise come to serve as signs of negation. mr. wedgwood remarks on this subject,[1118] that "when the voice is exerted with closed teeth or lips, it produces the sound of the letter _n_ or _m_. hence we may account for the use of the particle _ne_ to signify negation, and possibly also of the greek mh in the same sense." that these signs are innate or instinctive, at least with anglo-saxons, is rendered highly probable by the blind and deaf laura bridgman "constantly accompanying her _yes_ with the common affirmative nod, and her _no_ with our negative shake of the head." had not mr. lieber stated to the contrary,[1119] i should have imagined that these gestures might have been acquired or learnt by her, considering her wonderful sense of touch and appreciation of the movements of others. with microcephalous idiots, who are so degraded that they never learn to speak, one of them is described by vogt,[1120] as answering, when asked whether he wished for more food or drink, by inclining or shaking his head. schmalz, in his remarkable dissertation on the education of the deaf and dumb, as well as of children raised only one degree above idiotcy, assumes that they can always both make and understand the common signs of affirmation and negation. nevertheless if we look to the various races of man, these signs are not so universally employed as i should have expected; yet they seem too general to be ranked as altogether conventional or artificial. my informants assert that both signs are used by the malays, by the natives of ceylon, the chinese, the negroes of the guinea coast, and, according to gaika, by the kafirs of south africa, though with these latter people mrs. barber has never seen a lateral shake used as a negative. with respect to the australians, seven observers agree that a nod is given in affirmation; five agree about a lateral shake in negation, accompanied or not by some word; but mr. dyson lacy has never seen this latter sign in queensland, and mr. bulmer says that in gipps' land a negative is expressed by throwing the head a little backwards and putting out the tongue. at the northern extremity of the continent, near torres straits, the natives when uttering a negative "don't shake the head with it, but holding up the right hand, shake it by turning it half round and back again two or three times."[1122] the throwing back of the head with a cluck of the tongue is said to be used as a negative by the modern greeks and turks, the latter people expressing _yes_ by a movement like that made by us when we shake our heads.[1123] the abyssinians, as i am informed by captain speedy, express a negative by jerking the head to the right shoulder, together with a slight cluck, the mouth being closed; an affirmation is expressed by the head being thrown backwards and the eyebrows raised for an instant. the tagals of luzon, in the philippine archipelago, as i hear from dr. adolf meyer, when they say "yes," also throw the head backwards. according to the rajah brooke, the dyaks of borneo express an affirmation by raising the eyebrows, and a negation by slightly contracting them, together with a peculiar look from the eyes. with the arabs on the nile, professor and mrs. asa gray concluded that nodding in affirmation was rare, whilst shaking the head in negation was never used, and was not even understood by them. with the esquimaux[1124] a nod means _yes_ and a wink _no_. the new zealanders "elevate the head and chin in place of nodding acquiescence."[1125] with the hindoos mr. h. erskine concludes from inquiries made from experienced europeans, and from native gentlemen, that the signs of affirmation and negation vary--a nod and a lateral shake being sometimes used as we do; but a negative is more commonly expressed by the head being thrown suddenly backwards and a little to one side, with a cluck of the tongue. what the meaning may be of this cluck of the tongue, which has been observed with various people, i cannot imagine. a native gentleman stated that affirmation is frequently shown by the head being thrown to the left. i asked mr. scott to attend particularly to this point, and, after repeated observations, he believes that a vertical nod is not commonly used by the natives in affirmation, but that the head is first thrown backwards either to the left or right, and then jerked obliquely forwards only once. this movement would perhaps have been described by a less careful observer as a lateral shake. he also states that in negation the head is usually held nearly upright, and shaken several times. mr. bridges informs me that the fuegians nod their heads vertically in affirmation, and shake them laterally in denial. with the wild indians of north america, according to mr. washington matthews, nodding and shaking the head have been learnt from europeans, and are not naturally employed. they express affirmation by describing with the hand (all the fingers except the index being flexed) a curve downwards and outwards from the body, whilst negation is expressed by moving the open hand outwards, with the palm facing inwards. other observers state that the sign of affirmation with these indians is the forefinger being raised, and then lowered and pointed to the ground, or the hand is waved straight forward from the face; and that the sign of negation is the finger or whole hand shaken from side to side.[1126] this latter movement probably represents in all cases the lateral shaking of the head. the italians are said in like manner to move the lifted finger from right to left in negation, as indeed we english sometimes do. on the whole we find considerable diversity in the signs of affirmation and negation in the different races of man. with respect to negation, if we admit that the shaking of the finger or hand from side to side is symbolic of the lateral movement of the head; and if we admit that the sudden backward movement of the head represents one of the actions often practised by young children in refusing food, then there is much uniformity throughout the world in the signs of negation, and we can see how they originated. the most marked exceptions are presented by the arabs, esquimaux, some australian tribes, and dyaks. with the latter a frown is the sign of negation, and with us frowning often accompanies a lateral shake of the head. with respect to nodding in affirmation, the exceptions are rather more numerous, namely with some of the hindoos, with the turks, abyssinians, dyaks, tagals, and new zealanders. the eyebrows are sometimes raised in affirmation, and as a person in bending his head forwards and downwards naturally looks up to the person whom he addresses, he will be apt to raise his eyebrows, and this sign may thus have arisen as an abbreviation. so again with the new zealanders, the lifting up the chin and head in affirmation may perhaps represent in an abbreviated form the upward movement of the head after it has been nodded forwards and downwards. chapter xii. -- surprise--astonishment--fear--horror. surprise, astonishment--elevation of the eyebrows--opening the mouth--protrusion of the lips--gestures accompanying surprise--admiration--fear--terror--erection of the hair--contraction of the platysma muscle--dilatation of the pupils--horror--conclusion. attention, if sudden and close, graduates into surprise; and this into astonishment; and this into stupefied amazement. the latter frame of mind is closely akin to terror. attention is shown by the eyebrows being slightly raised; and as this state increases into surprise, they are raised to a much greater extent, with the eyes and mouth widely open. the raising of the eyebrows is necessary in order that the eyes should be opened quickly and widely; and this movement produces transverse wrinkles across the forehead. the degree to which the eyes and mouth are opened corresponds with the degree of surprise felt; but these movements must be coordinated; for a widely opened mouth with eyebrows only slightly raised results in a meaningless grimace, as dr. duchenne has shown in one of his photographs.[1201] on the other hand, a person may often be seen to pretend surprise by merely raising his eyebrows. dr. duchenne has given a photograph of an old man with his eyebrows well elevated and arched by the galvanization of the frontal muscle; and with his mouth voluntarily opened. this figure expresses surprise with much truth. i showed it to twenty-four persons without a word of explanation, and one alone did not at all understand what was intended. a second person answered terror, which is not far wrong; some of the others, however, added to the words surprise or astonishment, the epithets horrified, woful, painful, or disgusted. the eyes and mouth being widely open is an expression universally recognized as one of surprise or astonishment. thus shakespeare says, "i saw a smith stand with open mouth swallowing a tailor's news." ('king john,' act iv. scene ii.) and again, "they seemed almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes; there was speech in the dumbness, language in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard of a world destroyed." ('winter's tale,' act v. scene ii.) my informants answer with remarkable uniformity to the same effect, with respect to the various races of man; the above movements of the features being often accompanied by certain gestures and sounds, presently to be described. twelve observers in different parts of australia agree on this head. mr. winwood reade has observed this expression with the negroes on the guinea coast. the chief gaika and others answer _yes_ to my query with respect to the kafirs of south africa; and so do others emphatically with reference to the abyssinians, ceylonese, chinese, fuegians, various tribes of north america, and new zealanders. with the latter, mr. stack states that the expression is more plainly shown by certain individuals than by others, though all endeavour as much as possible to conceal their feelings. the dyaks of borneo are said by the rajah brooke to open their eyes widely, when astonished, often swinging their heads to and fro, and beating their breasts. mr. scott informs me that the workmen in the botanic gardens at calcutta are strictly ordered not to smoke; but they often disobey this order, and when suddenly surprised in the act, they first open their eyes and mouths widely. they then often slightly shrug their shoulders, as they perceive that discovery is inevitable, or frown and stamp on the ground from vexation. soon they recover from their surprise, and abject fear is exhibited by the relaxation of all their muscles; their heads seem to sink between their shoulders; their fallen eyes wander to and fro; and they supplicate forgiveness. the well-known australian explorer, mr. stuart, has given[1202] a striking account of stupefied amazement together with terror in a native who had never before seen a man on horseback. mr. stuart approached unseen and called to him from a little distance. "he turned round and saw me. what he imagined i was i do not know; but a finer picture of fear and astonishment i never saw. he stood incapable of moving a limb, riveted to the spot, mouth open and eyes staring.... he remained motionless until our black got within a few yards of him, when suddenly throwing down his waddies, he jumped into a mulga bush as high as he could get." he could not speak, and answered not a word to the inquiries made by the black, but, trembling from head to foot, "waved with his hand for us to be off." that the eyebrows are raised by an innate or instinctive impulse may be inferred from the fact that laura bridgman invariably acts thus when astonished, as i have been assured by the lady who has lately had charge of her. as surprise is excited by something unexpected or unknown, we naturally desire, when startled, to perceive the cause as quickly as possible; and we consequently open our eyes fully, so that the field of vision may be increased, and the eyeballs moved easily in any direction. but this hardly accounts for the eyebrows being so greatly raised as is the case, and for the wild staring of the open eyes. the explanation lies, i believe, in the impossibility of opening the eyes with great rapidity by merely raising the upper lids. to effect this the eyebrows must be lifted energetically. any one who will try to open his eyes as quickly as possible before a mirror will find that he acts thus; and the energetic lifting up of the eyebrows opens the eyes so widely that they stare, the white being exposed all round the iris. moreover, the elevation of the eyebrows is an advantage in looking upwards; for as long as they are lowered they impede our vision in this direction. sir c. bell gives[1203] a curious little proof of the part which the eyebrows play in opening the eyelids. in a stupidly drunken man all the muscles are relaxed, and the eyelids consequently droop, in the same manner as when we are falling asleep. to counteract this tendency the drunkard raises his eyebrows; and this gives to him a puzzled, foolish look, as is well represented in one of hogarth's drawings. the habit of raising the eyebrows having once been gained in order to see as quickly as possible all around us, the movement would follow from the force of association whenever astonishment was felt from any cause, even from a sudden sound or an idea. with adult persons, when the eyebrows are raised, the whole forehead becomes much wrinkled in transverse lines; but with children this occurs only to a slight degree. the wrinkles run in lines concentric with each eyebrow, and are partially confluent in the middle. they are highly characteristic of the expression of surprise or astonishment. each eyebrow, when raised, becomes also, as duchenne remarks,[1204] more arched than it was before. the cause of the mouth being opened when astonishment is felt, is a much more complex affair; and several causes apparently concur in leading to this movement. it has often been supposed[1205] that the sense of hearing is thus rendered more acute; but i have watched persons listening intently to a slight noise, the nature and source of which they knew perfectly, and they did not open their mouths. therefore i at one time imagined that the open mouth might aid in distinguishing the direction whence a sound proceeded, by giving another channel for its entrance into the ear through the eustachian tube, but dr. w. ogle[1206] has been so kind as to search the best recent authorities on the functions of the eustachian tube, and he informs me that it is almost conclusively proved that it remains closed except during the act of deglutition; and that in persons in whom the tube remains abnormally open, the sense of hearing, as far as external sounds are concerned, is by no means improved; on the contrary, it is impaired by the respiratory sounds being rendered more distinct. if a watch be placed within the mouth, but not allowed to touch the sides, the ticking is heard much less plainly than when held outside. in persons in whom from disease or a cold the eustachian tube is permanently or temporarily closed, the sense of hearing is injured; but this may be accounted for by mucus accumulating within the tube, and the consequent exclusion of air. we may therefore infer that the mouth is not kept open under the sense of astonishment for the sake of hearing sounds more distinctly; notwithstanding that most deaf people keep their mouths open. every sudden emotion, including astonishment, quickens the action of the heart, and with it the respiration. now we can breathe, as gratiolet remarks[1207] and as appears to me to be the case, much more quietly through the open mouth than through the nostrils. therefore, when we wish to listen intently to any sound, we either stop breathing, or breathe as quietly as possible, by opening our mouths, at the same time keeping our bodies motionless. one of my sons was awakened in the night by a noise under circumstances which naturally led to great care, and after a few minutes he perceived that his mouth was widely open. he then became conscious that he had opened it for the sake of breathing as quietly as possible. this view receives support from the reversed case which occurs with dogs. a dog when panting after exercise, or on a hot day, breathes loudly; but if his attention be suddenly aroused, he instantly pricks his ears to listen, shuts his mouth, and breathes quietly, as he is enabled to do, through his nostrils. when the attention is concentrated for a length of time with fixed earnestness on any object or subject, all the organs of the body are forgotten and neglected;[1208] and as the nervous energy of each individual is limited in amount, little is transmitted to any part of the system, excepting that which is at the time brought into energetic action. therefore many of the muscles tend to become relaxed, and the jaw drops from its own weight. this will account for the dropping of the jaw and open mouth of a man stupefied with amazement, and perhaps when less strongly affected. i have noticed this appearance, as i find recorded in my notes, in very young children when they were only moderately surprised. there is still another and highly effective cause, leading to the mouth being opened, when we are astonished, and more especially when we are suddenly startled. we can draw a full and deep inspiration much more easily through the widely open mouth than through the nostrils. now when we start at any sudden sound or sight, almost all the muscles of the body are involuntarily and momentarily thrown into strong action, for the sake of guarding ourselves against or jumping away from the danger, which we habitually associate with anything unexpected. but we always unconsciously prepare ourselves for any great exertion, as formerly explained, by first taking a deep and full inspiration, and we consequently open our mouths. if no exertion follows, and we still remain astonished, we cease for a time to breathe, or breathe as quietly as possible, in order that every sound may be distinctly heard. or again, if our attention continues long and earnestly absorbed, all our muscles become relaxed, and the jaw, which was at first suddenly opened, remains dropped. thus several causes concur towards this same movement, whenever surprise, astonishment, or amazement is felt. although when thus affected, our mouths are generally opened, yet the lips are often a little protruded. this fact reminds us of the same movement, though in a much more strongly marked degree, in the chimpanzee and orang when astonished. as a strong expiration naturally follows the deep inspiration which accompanies the first sense of startled surprise, and as the lips are often protruded, the various sounds which are then commonly uttered can apparently be accounted for. but sometimes a strong expiration alone is heard; thus laura bridgman, when amazed, rounds and protrudes her lips, opens them, and breathes strongly.[1209] one of the commonest sounds is a deep _oh_; and this would naturally follow, as explained by helmholtz, from the mouth being moderately opened and the lips protruded. on a quiet night some rockets were fired from the 'beagle,' in a little creek at tahiti, to amuse the natives; and as each rocket, was let off there was absolute silence, but this was invariably followed by a deep groaning _oh_, resounding all round the bay. mr. washington matthews says that the north american indians express astonishment by a groan; and the negroes on the west coast of africa, according to mr. winwood reade, protrude their lips, and make a sound like _heigh, heigh_. if the mouth is not much opened, whilst the lips are considerably protruded, a blowing, hissing, or whistling noise is produced. mr. r. brough smith informs me that an australian from the interior was taken to the theatre to see an acrobat rapidly turning head over heels: "he was greatly astonished, and protruded his lips, making a noise with his mouth as if blowing out a match." according to mr. bulmer the australians, when surprised, utter the exclamation _korki_, "and to do this the mouth is drawn out as if going to whistle." we europeans often whistle as a sign of surprise; thus, in a recent novel[1210] it is said, "here the man expressed his astonishment and disapprobation by a prolonged whistle." a kafir girl, as mr. j. mansel weale informs me, "on hearing of the high price of an article, raised her eyebrows and whistled just as a european would." mr. wedgwood remarks that such sounds are written down as _whew_, and they serve as interjections for surprise. according to three other observers, the australians often evince astonishment by a clucking noise. europeans also sometimes express gentle surprise by a little clicking noise of nearly the same kind. we have seen that when we are startled, the mouth is suddenly opened; and if the tongue happens to be then pressed closely against the palate, its sudden withdrawal will produce a sound of this kind, which might thus come to express surprise. [illustration: gestures of the body. plate vii] turning to gestures of the body. a surprised person often raises his opened hands high above his head, or by bending his arms only to the level of his face. the flat palms are directed towards the person who causes this feeling, and the straightened fingers are separated. this gesture is represented by mr. rejlander in plate vii. fig. 1. in the 'last supper,' by leonardo da vinci, two of the apostles have their hands half uplifted, clearly expressive of their astonishment. a trustworthy observer told me that he had lately met his wife under most unexpected circumstances: "she started, opened her mouth and eyes very widely, and threw up both her arms above her head." several years ago i was surprised by seeing several of my young children earnestly doing something together on the ground; but the distance was too great for me to ask what they were about. therefore i threw up my open hands with extended fingers above my head; and as soon as i had done this, i became conscious of the action. i then waited, without saying a word, to see if my children had understood this gesture; and as they came running to me they cried out, "we saw that you were astonished at us." i do not know whether this gesture is common to the various races of man, as i neglected to make inquiries on this head. that it is innate or natural may be inferred from the fact that laura bridgman, when amazed, "spreads her arms and turns her hands with extended fingers upwards;"[1211] nor is it likely, considering that the feeling of surprise is generally a brief one, that she should have learnt this gesture through her keen sense of touch. huschke describes[1212] a somewhat different yet allied gesture, which he says is exhibited by persons when astonished. they hold themselves erect, with the features as before described, but with the straightened arms extended backwards--the stretched fingers being separated from each other. i have never myself seen this gesture; but huschke is probably correct; for a friend asked another man how he would express great astonishment, and he at once threw himself into this attitude. these gestures are, i believe, explicable on the principle of antithesis. we have seen that an indignant man holds his head erect, squares his shoulders, turns out his elbows, often clenches his fist, frowns, and closes his mouth; whilst the attitude of a helpless man is in every one of these details the reverse. now, a man in an ordinary frame of mind, doing nothing and thinking of nothing in particular, usually keeps his two arms suspended laxly by his sides, with his hands somewhat flexed, and the fingers near together. therefore, to raise the arms suddenly, either the whole arms or the fore-arms, to open the palms flat, and to separate the fingers,--or, again, to straighten the arms, extending them backwards with separated fingers,--are movements in complete antithesis to those preserved under an indifferent frame of mind, and they are, in consequence, unconsciously assumed by an astonished man. there is, also, often a desire to display surprise in a conspicuous manner, and the above attitudes are well fitted for this purpose. it may be asked why should surprise, and only a few other states of the mind, be exhibited by movements in antithesis to others. but this principle will not be brought into play in the case of those emotions, such as terror, great joy, suffering, or rage, which naturally lead to certain lines of action and produce certain effects on the body, for the whole system is thus preoccupied; and these emotions are already thus expressed with the greatest plainness. there is another little gesture, expressive of astonishment of which i can offer no explanation; namely, the hand being placed over the mouth or on some part of the head. this has been observed with so many races of man, that it must have some natural origin. a wild australian was taken into a large room full of official papers, which surprised him greatly, and he cried out, _cluck, cluck, cluck_, putting the back of his hand towards his lips. mrs. barber says that the kafirs and fingoes express astonishment by a serious look and by placing the right hand upon the mouth, littering the word _mawo_, which means 'wonderful.' the bushmen are said[1213] to put their right hands to their necks, bending their heads backwards. mr. winwood reade has observed that the negroes on the west coast of africa, when surprised, clap their hands to their mouths, saying at the same time, "my mouth cleaves to me," i. e. to my hands; and he has heard that this is their usual gesture on such occasions. captain speedy informs me that the abyssinians place their right hand to the forehead, with the palm outside. lastly, mr. washington matthews states that the conventional sign of astonishment with the wild tribes of the western parts of the united states "is made by placing the half-closed hand over the mouth; in doing this, the head is often bent forwards, and words or low groans are sometimes uttered." catlin[1214] makes the same remark about the hand being pressed over the mouth by the mandans and other indian tribes. _admiration_.--little need be said on this head. admiration apparently consists of surprise associated with some pleasure and a sense of approval. when vividly felt, the eyes are opened and the eyebrows raised; the eyes become bright, instead of remaining blank, as under simple astonishment; and the mouth, instead of gaping open, expands into a smile. _fear, terror_.--the word 'fear' seems to be derived from what is sudden and dangerous;[1215] and that of terror from the trembling of the vocal organs and body. i use the word 'terror' for extreme fear; but some writers think it ought to be confined to cases in which the imagination is more particularly concerned. fear is often preceded by astonishment, and is so far akin to it, that both lead to the senses of sight and hearing being instantly aroused. in both cases the eyes and mouth are widely opened, and the eyebrows raised. the frightened man at first stands like a statue motionless and breathless, or crouches down as if instinctively to escape observation. the heart beats quickly and violently, so that it palpitates or knocks against the ribs; but it is very doubtful whether it then works more efficiently than usual, so as to send a greater supply of blood to all parts of the body; for the skin instantly becomes pale, as during incipient faintness. this paleness of the surface, however, is probably in large part, or exclusively, due to the vasomotor centre being affected in such a manner as to cause the contraction of the small arteries of the skin. that the skin is much affected under the sense of great fear, we see in the marvellous and inexplicable manner in which perspiration immediately exudes from it. this exudation is all the more remarkable, as the surface is then cold, and hence the term a cold sweat; whereas, the sudorific glands are properly excited into action when the surface is heated. the hairs also on the skin stand erect; and the superficial muscles shiver. in connection with the disturbed action of the heart, the breathing is hurried. the salivary glands act imperfectly; the mouth becomes dry,[1216] and is often opened and shut. i have also noticed that under slight fear there is a strong tendency to yawn. one of the best-marked symptoms is the trembling of all the muscles of the body; and this is often first seen in the lips. from this cause, and from the dryness of the mouth, the voice becomes husky or indistinct, or may altogether fail. "obstupui, steteruntque comae, et vox faucibus haesit." of vague fear there is a well-known and grand description in job:--"in thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up. it stood still, but i could not discern the form thereof: an image was before my eyes, there was silence, and i heard a voice, saying, shall mortal man be more just than god? shall a man be more pure than his maker?" (job iv. 13) as fear increases into an agony of terror, we behold, as under all violent emotions, diversified results. the heart beats wildly, or may fail to act and faintness ensue; there is a death-like pallor; the breathing is laboured; the wings of the nostrils are wildly dilated; "there is a gasping and convulsive motion of the lips, a tremor on the hollow cheek, a gulping and catching of the throat;"[1217] the uncovered and protruding eyeballs are fixed on the object of terror; or they may roll restlessly from side to side, _huc illuc volvens oculos totumque pererrat_.[1218] the pupils are said to be enormously dilated. all the muscles of the body may become rigid, or may be thrown into convulsive movements. the hands are alternately clenched and opened, often with a twitching movement. the arms may be protruded, as if to avert some dreadful danger, or may be thrown wildly over the head. the rev. mr. hagenauer has seen this latter action in a terrified australian. in other cases there is a sudden and uncontrollable tendency to headlong flight; and so strong is this, that the boldest soldiers may be seized with a sudden panic. as fear rises to an extreme pitch, the dreadful scream of terror is heard. great beads of sweat stand on the skin. all the muscles of the body are relaxed. utter prostration soon follows, and the mental powers fail. the intestines are affected. the sphincter muscles cease to act, and no longer retain the contents of the body. [illustration: photograph of an insane woman. fig. 19] dr. j. crichton browne has given me so striking an account of intense fear in an insane woman, aged thirty-five, that the description though painful ought not to be omitted. when a paroxysm seizes her, she screams out, "this is hell!" "there is a black woman!" "i can't get out!"--and other such exclamations. when thus screaming, her movements are those of alternate tension and tremor. for one instant she clenches her hands, holds her arms out before her in a stiff semi-flexed position; then suddenly bends her body forwards, sways rapidly to and fro, draws her fingers through her hair, clutches at her neck, and tries to tear off her clothes. the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscles (which serve to bend the head on the chest) stand out prominently, as if swollen, and the skin in front of them is much wrinkled. her hair, which is cut short at the back of her head, and is smooth when she is calm, now stands on end; that in front being dishevelled by the movements of her hands. the countenance expresses great mental agony. the skin is flushed over the face and neck, down to the clavicles, and the veins of the forehead and neck stand out like thick cords. the lower lip drops, and is somewhat everted. the mouth is kept half open, with the lower jaw projecting. the cheeks are hollow and deeply furrowed in curved lines running from the wings of the nostrils to the corners of the mouth. the nostrils themselves are raised and extended. the eyes are widely opened, and beneath them the skin appears swollen; the pupils are large. the forehead is wrinkled transversely in many folds, and at the inner extremities of the eyebrows it is strongly furrowed in diverging lines, produced by the powerful and persistent contraction of the corrugators. [illustration: terror. fig. 20] mr. bell has also described[1219] an agony of terror and of despair, which he witnessed in a murderer, whilst carried to the place of execution in turin. "on each side of the car the officiating priests were seated; and in the centre sat the criminal himself. it was impossible to witness the condition of this unhappy wretch without terror; and yet, as if impelled by some strange infatuation, it was equally impossible not to gaze upon an object so wild, so full of horror. he seemed about thirty-five years of age; of large and muscular form; his countenance marked by strong and savage features; half naked, pale as death, agonized with terror, every limb strained in anguish, his hands clenched convulsively, the sweat breaking out on his bent and contracted brow, he kissed incessantly the figure of our saviour, painted on the flag which was suspended before him; but with an agony of wildness and despair, of which nothing ever exhibited on the stage can give the slightest conception." i will add only one other case, illustrative of a man utterly prostrated by terror. an atrocious murderer of two persons was brought into a hospital, under the mistaken impression that he had poisoned himself; and dr. w. ogle carefully watched him the next morning, while he was being handcuffed and taken away by the police. his pallor was extreme, and his prostration so great that he was hardly able to dress himself. his skin perspired; and his eyelids and head drooped so much that it was impossible to catch even a glimpse of his eyes. his lower jaw hung down. there was no contraction of any facial muscle, and dr. ogle is almost certain that the hair did not stand on end, for he observed it narrowly, as it had been dyed for the sake of concealment. with respect to fear, as exhibited by the various races of man, my informants agree that the signs are the same as with europeans. they are displayed in an exaggerated degree with the hindoos and natives of ceylon. mr. geach has seen malays when terrified turn pale and shake; and mr. brough smyth states that a native australian "being on one occasion much frightened, showed a complexion as nearly approaching to what we call paleness, as can well be conceived in the case of a very black man." mr. dyson lacy has seen extreme fear shown in an australian, by a nervous twitching of the hands, feet, and lips; and by the perspiration standing on the skin. many savages do not repress the signs of fear so much as europeans; and they often tremble greatly. with the kafir, gaika says, in his rather quaint english, the shaking "of the body is much experienced, and the eyes are widely open." with savages, the sphincter muscles are often relaxed, just as may be observed in much frightened dogs, and as i have seen with monkeys when terrified by being caught. _the erection of the hair_.--some of the signs of fear deserve a little further consideration. poets continually speak of the hair standing on end; brutus says to the ghost of caesar, "that mak'st my blood cold, and my hair to stare." and cardinal beaufort, after the murder of gloucester exclaims, "comb down his hair; look, look, it stands upright." as i did not feel sure whether writers of fiction might not have applied to man what they had often observed in animals, i begged for information from dr. crichton browne with respect to the insane. he states in answer that he has repeatedly seen their hair erected under the influence of sudden and extreme terror. for instance, it is occasionally necessary to inject morphia, under the skin of an insane woman, who dreads the operation extremely, though it causes very little pain; for she believes that poison is being introduced into her system, and that her bones will be softened, and her flesh turned into dust. she becomes deadly pale; her limbs are stiffened by a sort of tetanic spasm, and her hair is partially erected on the front of the head. dr. browne further remarks that the bristling of the hair which is so common in the insane, is not always associated with terror. it is perhaps most frequently seen in chronic maniacs, who rave incoherently and have destructive impulses; but it is during their paroxysms of violence that the bristling is most observable. the fact of the hair becoming erect under the influence both of rage and fear agrees perfectly with what we have seen in the lower animals. dr. browne adduces several cases in evidence. thus with a man now in the asylum, before the recurrence of each maniacal paroxysm, "the hair rises up from his forehead like the mane of a shetland pony." he has sent me photographs of two women, taken in the intervals between their paroxysms, and he adds with respect to one of these women, "that the state of her hair is a sure and convenient criterion of her mental condition." i have had one of these photographs copied, and the engraving gives, if viewed from a little distance, a faithful representation of the original, with the exception that the hair appears rather too coarse and too much curled. the extraordinary condition of the hair in the insane is due, not only to its erection, but to its dryness and harshness, consequent on the subcutaneous glands failing to act. dr. bucknill has said[1220] that a lunatic "is a lunatic to his finger's ends;" he might have added, and often to the extremity of each particular hair. dr. browne mentions as an empirical confirmation of the relation which exists in the insane between the state of their hair and minds, that the wife of a medical man, who has charge of a lady suffering from acute melancholia, with a strong fear of death, for herself, her husband and children, reported verbally to him the day before receiving my letter as follows, "i think mrs. ---- will soon improve, for her hair is getting smooth; and i always notice that our patients get better whenever their hair ceases to be rough and unmanageable." dr. browne attributes the persistently rough condition of the hair in many insane patients, in part to their minds being always somewhat disturbed, and in part to the effects of habit,--that is, to the hair being frequently and strongly erected during their many recurrent paroxysms. in patients in whom the bristling of the hair is extreme, the disease is generally permanent and mortal; but in others, in whom the bristling is moderate, as soon as they recover their health of mind the hair recovers its smoothness. in a previous chapter we have seen that with animals the hairs are erected by the contraction of minute, unstriped, and involuntary muscles, which run to each separate follicle. in addition to this action, mr. j. wood has clearly ascertained by experiment, as he informs me, that with man the hairs on the front of the head which slope forwards, and those on the back which slope backwards, are raised in opposite directions by the contraction of the occipito-frontalis or scalp muscle. so that this muscle seems to aid in the erection of the hairs on the head of man in the same manner as the homologous _panniculus carnosus_ aids, or takes the greater part, in the erection of the spines on the backs of some of the lower animals. _contraction of the platysma myoides muscle_.--this muscle is spread over the sides of the neck, extending downwards to a little beneath the collar-bones, and upwards to the lower part of the cheeks. a portion, called the risorius, is represented in the woodcut (m) fig. 2. the contraction of this muscle draws the corners of the mouth and the lower parts of the checks downwards and backwards. it produces at the same time divergent, longitudinal, prominent ridges on the sides of the neck in the young; and, in old thin persons, fine transverse wrinkles. this muscle is sometimes said not to be under the control of the will; but almost every one, if told to draw the corners of his mouth backwards and downwards with great force, brings it into action. i have, however, heard of a man who can voluntarily act on it only on one side of his neck. sir c. bell[1221] and others have stated that this muscle is strongly contracted under the influence of fear; and duchenne insists so strongly on its importance in the expression of this emotion, that he calls it the _muscle of fright_.[1222] he admits, however, that its contraction is quite inexpressive unless associated with widely open eyes and mouth. he has given a photograph (copied and reduced in the accompanying woodcut) of the same old man as on former occasions, with his eyebrows strongly raised, his mouth opened, and the platysma contracted, all by means of galvanism. the original photograph was shown to twenty-four persons, and they were separately asked, without any explanation being given, what expression was intended: twenty instantly answered, "intense fright" or "horror"; three said pain, and one extreme discomfort. dr. duchenne has given another photograph of the same old man, with the platysma contracted, the eyes and mouth opened, and the eyebrows rendered oblique, by means of galvanism. the expression thus induced is very striking (see plate vii. fig. 2); the obliquity of the eyebrows adding the appearance of great mental distress. the original was shown to fifteen persons; twelve answered terror or horror, and three agony or great suffering. from these cases, and from an examination of the other photographs given by dr. duchenne, together with his remarks thereon, i think there can be little doubt that the contraction of the platysma does add greatly to the expression of fear. nevertheless this muscle ought hardly to be called that of fright, for its contraction is certainly not a necessary concomitant of this state of mind. a man may exhibit extreme terror in the plainest manner by death-like pallor, by drops of perspiration on his skin, and by utter prostration, with all the muscles of his body, including the platysma, completely relaxed. although dr. browne has often seen this muscle quivering and contracting in the insane, he has not been able to connect its action with any emotional condition in them, though he carefully attended to patients suffering from great fear. mr. nicol, on the other hand, has observed three cases in which this muscle appeared to be more or less permanently contracted under the influence of melancholia, associated with much dread; but in one of these cases, various other muscles about the neck and head were subject to spasmodic contractions. dr. w. ogle observed for me in one of the london hospitals about twenty patients, just before they were put under the influence of chloroform for operations. they exhibited some trepidation, but no great terror. in only four of the cases was the platysma visibly contracted; and it did not begin to contract until the patients began to cry. the muscle seemed to contract at the moment of each deep-drawn inspiration; so that it is very doubtful whether the contraction depended at all on the emotion of fear. in a fifth case, the patient, who was not chloroformed, was much terrified; and his platysma was more forcibly and persistently contracted than in the other cases. but even here there is room for doubt, for the muscle which appeared to be unusually developed, was seen by dr. ogle to contract as the man moved his head from the pillow, after the operation was over. as i felt much perplexed why, in any case, a superficial muscle on the neck should be especially affected by fear, i applied to my many obliging correspondents for information about the contraction of this muscle under other circumstances. it would be superfluous to give all the answers which i have received. they show that this muscle acts, often in a variable manner and degree, under many different conditions. it is violently contracted in hydrophobia, and in a somewhat less degree in lockjaw; sometimes in a marked manner during the insensibility from chloroform. dr. w. ogle observed two male patients, suffering from such difficulty in breathing, that the trachea had to be opened, and in both the platysma was strongly contracted. one of these men overheard the conversation of the surgeons surrounding him, and when he was able to speak, declared that he had not been frightened. in some other cases of extreme difficulty of respiration, though not requiring tracheotomy, observed by drs. ogle and langstaff, the platysma was not contracted. mr. j. wood, who has studied with such care the muscles of the human body, as shown by his various publications, has often seen the platysma contracted in vomiting, nausea, and disgust; also in children and adults under the influence of rage,--for instance, in irishwomen, quarrelling and brawling together with angry gesticulations. this may possibly have been due to their high and angry tones; for i know a lady, an excellent musician, who, in singing certain high notes, always contracts her platysma. so does a young man, as i have observed, in sounding certain notes on the flute. mr. j. wood informs me that he has found the platysma best developed in persons with thick necks and broad shoulders; and that in families inheriting these peculiarities, its development is usually associated with much voluntary power over the homologous occipito-frontalis muscle, by which the scalp can be moved. none of the foregoing cases appear to throw any light on the contraction of the platysma from fear; but it is different, i think, with the following cases. the gentleman before referred to, who can voluntarily act on this muscle only on one side of his neck, is positive that it contracts on both sides whenever he is startled. evidence has already been given showing that this muscle sometimes contracts, perhaps for the sake of opening the mouth widely, when the breathing is rendered difficult by disease, and during the deep inspirations of crying-fits before an operation. now, whenever a person starts at any sudden sight or sound, he instantaneously draws a deep breath; and thus the contraction of the platysma may possibly have become associated with the sense of fear. but there is, i believe, a more efficient relation. the first sensation of fear, or the imagination of something dreadful, commonly excites a shudder. i have caught myself giving a little involuntary shudder at a painful thought, and i distinctly perceived that my platysma contracted; so it does if i simulate a shudder. i have asked others to act in this manner; and in some the muscle contracted, but not in others. one of my sons, whilst getting out of bed, shuddered from the cold, and, as he happened to have his hand on his neck, he plainly felt that this muscle strongly contracted. he then voluntarily shuddered, as he had done on former occasions, but the platysma was not then affected. mr. j. wood has also several times observed this muscle contracting in patients, when stripped for examination, and who were not frightened, but shivered slightly from the cold. unfortunately i have not been able to ascertain whether, when the whole body shakes, as in the cold stage of an ague fit, the platysma contracts. but as it certainly often contracts during a shudder; and as a shudder or shiver often accompanies the first sensation of fear, we have, i think, a clue to its action in this latter case.[1223] its contraction, however, is not an invariable concomitant of fear; for it probably never acts under the influence of extreme, prostrating terror. _dilatation of the pupils_.--gratiolet repeatedly insists[1224] that the pupils are enormously dilated whenever terror is felt. i have no reason to doubt the accuracy of this statement, but have failed to obtain confirmatory evidence, excepting in the one instance before given of an insane woman suffering from great fear. when writers of fiction speak of the eyes being widely dilated, i presume that they refer to the eyelids. munro's statement, that with parrots the iris is affected by the passions, independently of the amount of light, seems to bear on this question; but professor donders informs me, that he has often seen movements in the pupils of these birds which he thinks may be related to their power of accommodation to distance, in nearly the same manner as our own pupils contract when our eyes converge for near vision. gratiolet remarks that the dilated pupils appear as if they were gazing into profound darkness. no doubt the fears of man have often been excited in the dark; but hardly so often or so exclusively, as to account for a fixed and associated habit having thus arisen. it seems more probable, assuming that gratiolet's statement is correct, that the brain is directly affected by the powerful emotion of fear and reacts on the pupils; but professor donders informs me that this is an extremely complicated subject. i may add, as possibly throwing light on the subject, that dr. fyffe, of netley hospital, has observed in two patients that the pupils were distinctly dilated during the cold stage of an ague fit. professor donders has also often seen dilatation of the pupils in incipient faintness. _horror_.--the state of mind expressed by this term implies terror, and is in some, cases almost synonymous with it. many a man must have felt, before the blessed discovery of chloroform, great horror at the thought of an impending surgical operation. he who dreads, as well as hates a man, will feel, as milton uses the word, a horror of him. we feel horror if we see any one, for instance a child, exposed to some instant and crushing danger. almost every one would experience the same feeling in the highest degree in witnessing a man being tortured or going to be tortured. in these cases there is no danger to ourselves; but from the power of the imagination and of sympathy we put ourselves in the position of the sufferer, and feel something akin to fear. [illustration: horror and agony. fig. 21] sir c. bell remarks,[1226] that "horror is full of energy; the body is in the utmost tension, not unnerved by fear." it is, therefore, probable that horror would generally be accompanied by the strong contraction of the brows; but as fear is one of the elements, the eyes and mouth would be opened, and the eyebrows would be raised, as far as the antagonistic action of the corrugators permitted this movement. duchenne has given a photograph[1227] (fig. 21) of the same old man as before, with his eyes somewhat staring, the eyebrows partially raised, and at the same time strongly contracted, the mouth opened, and the platysma in action, all effected by the means of galvanism. he considers that the expression thus produced shows extreme terror with horrible pain or torture. a tortured man, as long as his sufferings allowed him to feel any dread for the future, would probably exhibit horror in an extreme degree. i have shown the original of this photograph to twenty-three persons of both sexes and various ages; and thirteen immediately answered horror, great pain, torture, or agony; three answered extreme fright; so that sixteen answered nearly in accordance with duchenne's belief. six, however, said anger, guided no doubt, by the strongly contracted brows, and overlooking the peculiarly opened mouth. one said disgust. on the whole, the evidence indicates that we have here a fairly good representation of horror and agony. the photograph before referred to (pl. vii. fig. 2) likewise exhibits horror; but in this the oblique eyebrows indicate great mental distress in place of energy. horror is generally accompanied by various gestures, which differ in different individuals. judging from pictures, the whole body is often turned away or shrinks; or the arms are violently protruded as if to push away some dreadful object. the most frequent gesture, as far as can be inferred from the action of persons who endeavour to express a vividly-imagined scene of horror, is the raising of both shoulders, with the bent arms pressed closely against the sides or chest. these movements are nearly the same with those commonly made when we feel very cold; and they are generally accompanied by a shudder, as well as by a deep expiration or inspiration, according as the chest happens at the time to be expanded or contracted. the sounds thus made are expressed by words like _uh_ or _ugh_.[1228] it is not, however, obvious why, when we feel cold or express a sense of horror, we press our bent arms against our bodies, raise our shoulders, and shudder. _conclusion_.--i have now endeavoured to describe the diversified expressions of fear, in its gradations from mere attention to a start of surprise, into extreme terror and horror. some of the signs may be accounted for through the principles of habit, association, and inheritance,--such as the wide opening of the mouth and eyes, with upraised eyebrows, so as to see as quickly as possible all around us, and to hear distinctly whatever sound may reach our ears. for we have thus habitually prepared ourselves to discover and encounter any danger. some of the other signs of fear may likewise be accounted for, at least in part, through these same principles. men, during numberless generations, have endeavoured to escape from their enemies or danger by headlong flight, or by violently struggling with them; and such great exertions will have caused the heart to beat rapidly, the breathing to be hurried, the chest to heave, and the nostrils to be dilated. as these exertions have often been prolonged to the last extremity, the final result will have been utter prostration, pallor, perspiration, trembling of all the muscles, or their complete relaxation. and now, whenever the emotion of fear is strongly felt, though it may not lead to any exertion, the same results tend to reappear, through the force of inheritance and association. nevertheless, it is probable that many or most of the above symptoms of terror, such as the beating of the heart, the trembling of the muscles, cold perspiration, &c., are in large part directly due to the disturbed or interrupted transmission of nerve-force from the cerebro-spinal system to various parts of the body, owing to the mind being so powerfully affected. we may confidently look to this cause, independently of habit and association, in such cases as the modified secretions of the intestinal canal, and the failure of certain glands to act. with respect to the involuntary bristling of the hair, we have good reason to believe that in the case of animals this action, however it may have originated, serves, together with certain voluntary movements, to make them appear terrible to their enemies; and as the same involuntary and voluntary actions are performed by animals nearly related to man, we are led to believe that man has retained through inheritance a relic of them, now become useless. it is certainly a remarkable fact, that the minute unstriped muscles, by which the hairs thinly scattered over man's almost naked body are erected, should have been preserved to the present day; and that they should still contract under the same emotions, namely, terror and rage, which cause the hairs to stand on end in the lower members of the order to which man belongs. chapter xiii. -- self-attention--shame--shyness--modesty: blushing. nature of a blush--inheritance--the parts of the body most affected--blushing in the various races of man--accompanying gestures--confusion of mind--causes of blushing--self-attention, the fundamental element--shyness--shame, from broken moral laws and conventional rules--modesty--theory of blushing--recapitulation. blushing is the most peculiar and the most human of all expressions. monkeys redden from passion, but it would require an overwhelming amount of evidence to make us believe that any animal could blush. the reddening of the face from a blush is due to the relaxation of the muscular coats of the small arteries, by which the capillaries become filled with blood; and this depends on the proper vaso-motor centre being affected. no doubt if there be at the same time much mental agitation, the general circulation will be affected; but it is not due to the action of the heart that the network of minute vessels covering the face becomes under a sense of shame gorged with blood. we can cause laughing by tickling the skin, weeping or frowning by a blow, trembling from the fear of pain, and so forth; but we cannot cause a blush, as dr. burgess remarks,[1301] by any physical means,--that is by any action on the body. it is the mind which must be affected. blushing is not only involuntary; but the wish to restrain it, by leading to self-attention actually increases the tendency. the young blush much more freely than the old, but not during infancy,[1302] which is remarkable, as we know that infants at a very early age redden from passion. i have received authentic accounts of two little girls blushing at the ages of between two and three years; and of another sensitive child, a year older, blushing, when reproved for a fault. many children, at a somewhat more advanced age blush in a strongly marked manner. it appears that the mental powers of infants are not as yet sufficiently developed to allow of their blushing. hence, also, it is that idiots rarely blush. dr. crichton browne observed for me those under his care, but never saw a genuine blush, though he has seen their faces flash, apparently from joy, when food was placed before them, and from anger. nevertheless some, if not utterly degraded, are capable of blushing. a microcephalous idiot, for instance, thirteen years old, whose eyes brightened a little when he was pleased or amused, has been described by dr. behn,[1303] as blushing and turning to one side, when undressed for medical examination. women blush much more than men. it is rare to see an old man, but not nearly so rare to see an old woman blushing. the blind do not escape. laura bridgman, born in this condition, as well as completely deaf, blushes.[1304] the rev. r. h. blair, principal of the worcester college, informs me that three children born blind, out of seven or eight then in the asylum, are great blushers. the blind are not at first conscious that they are observed, and it is a most important part of their education, as mr. blair informs me, to impress this knowledge on their minds; and the impression thus gained would greatly strengthen the tendency to blush, by increasing the habit of self-attention. the tendency to blush is inherited. dr. burgess gives the case[1305] of a family consisting of a father, mother, and ten children, all of whom, without exception, were prone to blush to a most painful degree. the children were grown up; "and some of them were sent to travel in order to wear away this diseased sensibility, but nothing was of the slightest avail." even peculiarities in blushing seem to be inherited. sir james paget, whilst examining the spine of a girl, was struck at her singular manner of blushing; a big splash of red appeared first on one cheek, and then other splashes, variously scattered over the face and neck. he subsequently asked the mother whether her daughter always blushed in this peculiar manner; and was answered, "yes, she takes after me." sir j. paget then perceived that by asking this question he had caused the mother to blush; and she exhibited the same peculiarity as her daughter. in most cases the face, ears and neck are the sole parts which redden; but many persons, whilst blushing intensely, feel that their whole bodies grow hot and tingle; and this shows that the entire surface must be in some manner affected. blushes are said sometimes to commence on the forehead, but more commonly on the cheeks, afterwards spreading to the ears and neck.[1306] in two albinos examined by dr. burgess, the blushes commenced by a small circumscribed spot on the cheeks, over the parotidean plexus of nerves, and then increased into a circle; between this blushing circle and the blush on the neck there was an evident line of demarcation; although both arose simultaneously. the retina, which is naturally red in the albino, invariably increased at the same time in redness.[1307] every one must have noticed how easily after one blush fresh blushes chase each other over the face. blushing is preceded by a peculiar sensation in the skin. according to dr. burgess the reddening of the skin is generally succeeded by a slight pallor, which shows that the capillary vessels contract after dilating. in some rare cases paleness instead of redness is caused under conditions which would naturally induce a blush. for instance, a young lady told me that in a large and crowded party she caught her hair so firmly on the button of a passing servant, that it took some time before she could be extricated; from her sensations she imagined that she had blushed crimson; but was assured by a friend that she had turned extremely pale. i was desirous to learn how far down the body blushes extend; and sir j. paget, who necessarily has frequent opportunities for observation, has kindly attended to this point for me during two or three years. he finds that with women who blush intensely on the face, ears, and nape of neck, the blush does not commonly extend any lower down the body. it is rare to see it as low down as the collar-bones and shoulder-blades; and he has never himself seen a single instance in which it extended below the upper part of the chest. he has also noticed that blushes sometimes die away downwards, not gradually and insensibly, but by irregular ruddy blotches. dr. langstaff has likewise observed for me several women whose bodies did not in the least redden while their faces were crimsoned with blushes. with the insane, some of whom appear to be particularly liable to blushing, dr. j. crichton browne has several times seen the blush extend as far down as the collar-bones, and in two instances to the breasts. he gives me the case of a married woman, aged twenty-seven, who suffered from epilepsy. on the morning after her arrival in the asylum, dr. browne, together with his assistants, visited her whilst she was in bed. the moment that he approached, she blushed deeply over her cheeks and temples; and the blush spread quickly to her ears. she was much agitated and tremulous. he unfastened the collar of her chemise in order to examine the state of her lungs; and then a brilliant blush rushed over her chest, in an arched line over the upper third of each breast, and extended downwards between the breasts nearly to the ensiform cartilage of the sternum. this case is interesting, as the blush did not thus extend downwards until it became intense by her attention being drawn to this part of her person. as the examination proceeded she became composed, and the blush disappeared; but on several subsequent occasions the same phenomena were observed. the foregoing facts show that, as a general rule, with english women, blushing does not extend beneath the neck and upper part of the chest. nevertheless sir j. paget informs me that he has lately heard of a case, on which he can fully rely, in which a little girl, shocked by what she imagined to be an act of indelicacy, blushed all over her abdomen and the upper parts of her legs. moreau also[1308] relates, on the authority of a celebrated painter, that the chest, shoulders, arms, and whole body of a girl, who unwillingly consented to serve as a model, reddened when she was first divested of her clothes. it is a rather curious question why, in most cases the face, ears, and neck alone redden, inasmuch as the whole surface of the body often tingles and grows hot. this seems to depend, chiefly, on the face and adjoining parts of the skin having been habitually exposed to the air, light, and alternations of temperature, by which the small arteries not only have acquired the habit of readily dilating and contracting, but appear to have become unusually developed in comparison with other parts of the surface.[1309] it is probably owing to this same cause, as m. moreau and dr. burgess have remarked, that the face is so liable to redden under various circumstances, such as a fever-fit, ordinary heat, violent exertion, anger, a slight blow, &c.; and on the other hand that it is liable to grow pale from cold and fear, and to be discoloured during pregnancy. the face is also particularly liable to be affected by cutaneous complaints, by small-pox, erysipelas, &c. this view is likewise supported by the fact that the men of certain races, who habitually go nearly naked, often blush over their arms and chests and even down to their waists. a lady, who is a great blusher, informs dr. crichton browne, that when she feels ashamed or is agitated, she blushes over her face, neck, wrists, and hands,--that is, over all the exposed portions of her skin. nevertheless it may be doubted whether the habitual exposure of the skin of the face and neck, and its consequent power of reaction under stimulants of all kinds, is by itself sufficient to account for the much greater tendency in english women of these parts than of others to blush; for the hands are well supplied with nerves and small vessels, and have been as much exposed to the air as the face or neck, and yet the hands rarely blush. we shall presently see that the attention of the mind having been directed much more frequently and earnestly to the face than to any other part of the body, probably affords a sufficient explanation. _blushing in the various races of man_.--the small vessels of the face become filled with blood, from the emotion of shame, in almost all the races of man, though in the very dark races no distinct change of colour can be perceived. blushing is evident in all the aryan nations of europe, and to a certain extent with those of india. but mr. erskine has never noticed that the necks of the hindoos are decidedly affected. with the lepchas of sikhim, mr. scott has often observed a faint blush on the cheeks, base of the ears, and sides of the neck, accompanied by sunken eyes and lowered head. this has occurred when he has detected them in a falsehood, or has accused them of ingratitude. the pale, sallow complexions of these men render a blush much more conspicuous than in most of the other natives of india. with the latter, shame, or it may be in part fear, is expressed, according to mr. scott, much more plainly by the head being averted or bent down, with the eyes wavering or turned askant, than by any change of colour in the skin. the semitic races blush freely, as might have been expected, from their general similitude to the aryans. thus with the jews, it is said in the book of jeremiah (chap. vi. 15), "nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush." mrs. asa gray saw an arab managing his boat clumsily on the nile, and when laughed at by his companions, "he blushed quite to the back of his neck." lady duff gordon remarks that a young arab blushed on coming into her presence.[1310] mr. swinhoe has seen the chinese blushing, but he thinks it is rare; yet they have the expression "to redden with shame." mr. geach informs me that the chinese settled in malacca and the native malays of the interior both blush. some of these people go nearly naked, and he particularly attended to the downward extension of the blush. omitting the cases in which the face alone was seen to blush, mr. geach observed that the face, arms, and breast of a chinaman, aged 24 years, reddened from shame; and with another chinese, when asked why he had not done his work in better style, the whole body was similarly affected. in two malays[1311] he saw the face, neck, breast, and arms blushing; and in a third malay (a bugis) the blush extended down to the waist. the polynesians blush freely. the rev. mr. stack has seen hundreds of instances with the new zealanders. the following case is worth giving, as it relates to an old man who was unusually dark-coloured and partly tattooed. after having let his land to an englishman for a small yearly rental, a strong passion seized him to buy a gig, which had lately become the fashion with the maoris. he consequently wished to draw all the rent for four years from his tenant, and consulted mr. stack whether he could do so. the man was old, clumsy, poor, and ragged, and the idea of his driving himself about in his carriage for display amused mr. stack so much that he could not help bursting out into a laugh; and then "the old man blushed up to the roots of his hair." forster says that "you may easily distinguish a spreading blush" on the cheeks of the fairest women in tahiti.[1312] the natives also of several of the other archipelagoes in the pacific have been seen to blush. mr. washington matthews has often seen a blush on the faces of the young squaws belonging to various wild indian tribes of north america. at the opposite extremity of the continent in tierra del fuego, the natives, according to mr. bridges, "blush much, but chiefly in regard to women; but they certainly blush also at their own personal appearance." this latter statement agrees with what i remember of the fuegian, jemmy button, who blushed when he was quizzed about the care which he took in polishing his shoes, and in otherwise adorning himself. with respect to the aymara indians on the lofty plateaus of bolivia, mr. forbes says,[1313] that from the colour of their skins it is impossible that their blushes should be as clearly visible as in the white races; still under such circumstances as would raise a blush in us, "there can always be seen the same expression of modesty or confusion; and even in the dark, a rise of temperature of the skin of the face can be felt, exactly as occurs in the european." with the indians who inhabit the hot, equable, and damp parts of south america, the skin apparently does not answer to mental excitement so readily as with the natives of the northern and southern parts of the continent, who have long been exposed to great vicissitudes of climate; for humboldt quotes without a protest the sneer of the spaniard, "how can those be trusted, who know not how to blush?"[1314] von spix and martius, in speaking of the aborigines of brazil, assert that they cannot properly be said to blush; "it was only after long intercourse with the whites, and after receiving some education, that we perceived in the indians a change of colour expressive of the emotions of their minds."[1315] it is, however, incredible that the power of blushing could have thus originated; but the habit of self-attention, consequent on their education and new course of life, would have much increased any innate tendency to blush. several trustworthy observers have assured me that they have seen on the faces of negroes an appearance resembling a blush, under circumstances which would have excited one in us, though their skins were of an ebony-black tint. some describe it as blushing brown, but most say that the blackness becomes more intense. an increased supply of blood in the skin seems in some manner to increase its blackness; thus certain exanthematous diseases cause the affected places in the negro to appear blacker, instead of, as with us, redder.[1316] the skin, perhaps, from being rendered more tense by the filling of the capillaries, would reflect a somewhat different tint to what it did before. that the capillaries of the face in the negro become filled with blood, under the emotion of shame, we may feel confident; because a perfectly characterized albino negress, described by buffon,[1317] showed a faint tinge of crimson on her cheeks when she exhibited herself naked. cicatrices of the skin remain for a long time white in the negro, and dr. burgess, who had frequent opportunities of observing a scar of this kind on the face of a negress, distinctly saw that it "invariably became red whenever she was abruptly spoken to, or charged with any trivial offence."[1318] the blush could be seen proceeding from the circumference of the scar towards the middle, but it did not reach the centre. mulattoes are often great blushers, blush succeeding blush over their faces. from these facts there can be no doubt that negroes blush, although no redness is visible on the skin. i am assured by gaika and by mrs. barber that the kafirs of south africa never blush; but this may only mean that no change of colour is distinguishable. gaika adds that under the circumstances which would make a european blush, his countrymen "look ashamed to keep their heads up." it is asserted by four of my informants that the australians, who are almost as black as negroes, never blush. a fifth answers doubtfully, remarking that only a very strong blush could be seen, on account of the dirty state of their skins. three observers state that they do blush;[1319] mr. s. wilson adding that this is noticeable only under a strong emotion, and when the skin is not too dark from long exposure and want of cleanliness. mr. lang answers, "i have noticed that shame almost always excites a blush, which frequently extends as low as the neck." shame is also shown, as he adds, "by the eyes being turned from side to side." as mr. lang was a teacher in a native school, it is probable that he chiefly observed children; and we know that they blush more than adults. mr. g. taplin has seen half-castes blushing, and he says that the aborigines have a word expressive of shame. mr. hagenauer, who is one of those who has never observed the australians to blush, says that he has "seen them looking down to the ground on account of shame;" and the missionary, mr. bulmer, remarks that though "i have not been able to detect anything like shame in the adult aborigines, i have noticed that the eyes of the children, when ashamed, present a restless, watery appearance, as if they did not know where to look." the facts now given are sufficient to show that blushing, whether or not there is any change of colour, is common to most, probably to all, of the races of man. _movements and gestures which accompany blushing_.--under a keen sense of shame there is a strong desire for concealment.[1320] we turn away the whole body, more especially the face, which we endeavour in some manner to hide. an ashamed person can hardly endure to meet the gaze of those present, so that he almost invariably casts down his eyes or looks askant. as there generally exists at the same time a strong wish to avoid the appearance of shame, a vain attempt is made to look direct at the person who causes this feeling; and the antagonism between these opposite tendencies leads to various restless movements in the eyes. i have noticed two ladies who, whilst blushing, to which they are very liable, have thus acquired, as it appears, the oddest trick of incessantly blinking their eyelids with extraordinary rapidity. an intense blush is sometimes accompanied by a slight effusion of tears;[1321] and this, i presume, is due to the lacrymal glands partaking of the increased supply of blood, which we know rushes into the capillaries of the adjoining parts, including the retina. many writers, ancient and modern, have noticed the foregoing movements; and it has already been shown that the aborigines in various parts of the world often exhibit their shame by looking downwards or askant, or by restless movements of their eyes. ezra cries out (ch. ix. 6), "o, my god! i am ashamed, and blush to lift up my head to thee, my god." in isaiah (ch. i. 6) we meet with the words, "i hid not my face from shame." seneca remarks (epist. xi. 5) "that the roman players hang down their heads, fix their eyes on the ground and keep them lowered, but are unable to blush in acting shame." according to macrobius, who lived in the filth century ('saturnalia,' b. vii. c. 11), "natural philosophers assert that nature being moved by shame spreads the blood before herself as a veil, as we see any one blushing often puts his hands before his face." shakspeare makes marcus ('titus andronicus,' act ii, sc. 5) say to his niece, "ah! now thou turn'st away thy face for shame." a lady informs me that she found in the lock hospital a girl whom she had formerly known, and who had become a wretched castaway, and the poor creature, when approached, hid her face under the bed-clothes, and could not be persuaded to uncover it. we often see little children, when shy or ashamed, turn away, and still standing up, bury their faces in their mother's gown; or they throw themselves face downwards on her lap. _confusion of mind_.--most persons, whilst blushing intensely, have their mental powers confused. this is recognized in such common expressions as "she was covered with confusion." persons in this condition lose their presence of mind, and utter singularly inappropriate remarks. they are often much distressed, stammer, and make awkward movements or strange grimaces. in certain cases involuntary twitchings of some of the facial muscles may be observed. i have been informed by a young lady, who blushes excessively, that at such times she does not even know what she is saying. when it was suggested to her that this might be due to her distress from the consciousness that her blushing was noticed, she answered that this could not be the case, "as she had sometimes felt quite as stupid when blushing at a thought in her own room." i will give an instance of the extreme disturbance of mind to which some sensitive men are liable. a gentleman, on whom i can rely, assured me that he had been an eye-witness of the following scene:--a small dinner-party was given in honour of an extremely shy man, who, when he rose to return thanks, rehearsed the speech, which he had evidently learnt by heart, in absolute silence, and did not utter a single word; but he acted as if he were speaking with much emphasis. his friends, perceiving how the case stood, loudly applauded the imaginary bursts of eloquence, whenever his gestures indicated a pause, and the man never discovered that he had remained the whole time completely silent. on the contrary, he afterwards remarked to my friend, with much satisfaction, that he thought he had succeeded uncommonly well. when a person is much ashamed or very shy, and blushes intensely, his heart beats rapidly and his breathing is disturbed. this can hardly fail to affect the circulation of the blood within the brain, and perhaps the mental powers. it seems however doubtful, judging from the still more powerful influence of anger and fear on the circulation, whether we can thus satisfactorily account for the confused state of mind in persons whilst blushing intensely. the true explanation apparently lies in the intimate sympathy which exists between the capillary circulation of the surface of the head and face, and that of the brain. on applying to dr. j. crichton browne for information, he has given me various facts bearing on this subject. when the sympathetic nerve is divided on one side of the head, the capillaries on this side are relaxed and become filled with blood, causing the skin to redden and to grow hot, and at the same time the temperature within the cranium on the same side rises. inflammation of the membranes of the brain leads to the engorgement of the face, ears, and eyes with blood. the first stage of an epileptic fit appears to be the contraction of the vessels of the brain, and the first outward manifestation is, an extreme pallor of countenance. erysipelas of the head commonly induces delirium. even the relief given to a severe headache by burning the skin with strong lotion, depends, i presume, on the same principle. dr. browne has often administered to his patients the vapour of the nitrite of amyl,[1322] which has the singular property of causing vivid redness of the face in from thirty to sixty seconds. this flushing resembles blushing in almost every detail: it begins at several distinct points on the face, and spreads till it involves the whole surface of the head, neck, and front of the chest; but has been observed to extend only in one case to the abdomen. the arteries in the retina become enlarged; the eyes glisten, and in one instance there was a slight effusion of tears. the patients are at first pleasantly stimulated, but, as the flushing increases, they become confused and bewildered. one woman to whom the vapour had often been administered asserted that, as soon as she grew hot, she grew muddled. with persons just commencing to blush it appears, judging from their bright eyes and lively behaviour, that their mental powers are somewhat stimulated. it is only when the blushing is excessive that the mind grows confused. therefore it would seem that the capillaries of the face are affected, both during the inhalation of the nitrite of amyl and during blushing, before that part of the brain is affected on which the mental powers depend. conversely when the brain is primarily affected; the circulation of the skin is so in a secondary manner. dr. browne has frequently observed, as he informs me, scattered red blotches and mottlings on the chests of epileptic patients. in these cases, when the skin on the thorax or abdomen is gently rubbed with a pencil or other object, or, in strongly-marked cases, is merely touched by the finger, the surface becomes suffused in less than half a minute with bright red marks, which spread to some distance on each side of the touched point, and persist for several minutes. these are the _cerebral maculae_ of trousseau; and they indicate, as dr. browne remarks, a highly modified condition of the cutaneous vascular system. if, then, there exists, as cannot be doubted, an intimate sympathy between the capillary circulation in that part of the brain on which our mental powers depend, and in the skin of the face, it is not surprising that the moral causes which induce intense blushing should likewise induce, independently of their own disturbing influence, much confusion of mind. _the nature of the mental states which induce blushing_.--these consist of shyness, shame, and modesty; the essential element in all being self-attention. many reasons can be assigned for believing that originally self-attention directed to personal appearance, in relation to the opinion of others, was the exciting cause; the same effect being subsequently produced, through the force of association, by self-attention in relation to moral conduct. it is not the simple act of reflecting on our own appearance, but the thinking what others think of us, which excites a blush. in absolute solitude the most sensitive person would be quite indifferent about his appearance. we feel blame or disapprobation more acutely than approbation; and consequently depreciatory remarks or ridicule, whether of our appearance or conduct, causes us to blush much more readily than does praise. but undoubtedly praise and admiration are highly efficient: a pretty girl blushes when a man gazes intently at her, though she may know perfectly well that he is not depreciating her. many children, as well as old and sensitive persons blush, when they are much praised. hereafter the question will be discussed, how it has arisen that the consciousness that others are attending to our personal appearance should have led to the capillaries, especially those of the face, instantly becoming filled with blood. my reasons for believing that attention directed to personal appearance, and not to moral conduct, has been the fundamental element in the acquirement of the habit of blushing, will now be given. they are separately light, but combined possess, as it appears to me, considerable weight. it is notorious that nothing makes a shy person blush so much as any remark, however slight, on his personal appearance. one cannot notice even the dress of a woman much given to blushing, without causing her face to crimson. it is sufficient to stare hard at some persons to make them, as coleridge remarks, blush,--"account for that he who can."[1323] with the two albinos observed by dr. burgess,[1324] "the slightest attempt to examine their peculiarities invariably caused them to blush deeply." women are much more sensitive about their personal appearance than men are, especially elderly women in comparison with elderly men, and they blush much more freely. the young of both sexes are much more sensitive on this same head than the old, and they also blush much more freely than the old. children at a very early age do not blush; nor do they show those other signs of self-consciousness which generally accompany blushing; and it is one of their chief charms that they think nothing about what others think of them. at this early age they will stare at a stranger with a fixed gaze and un-blinking eyes, as on an inanimate object, in a manner which we elders cannot imitate. it is plain to every one that young men and women are highly sensitive to the opinion of each other with reference to their personal appearance; and they blush incomparably more in the presence of the opposite sex than in that of their own.[1325] a young man, not very liable to blush, will blush intensely at any slight ridicule of his appearance from a girl whose judgment on any important subject lie would disregard. no happy pair of young lovers, valuing each other's admiration and love more than anything else in the world, probably ever courted each other without many a blush. even the barbarians of tierra del fuego, according to mr. bridges, blush "chiefly in regard to women, but certainly also at their own personal appearance." of all parts of the body, the face is most considered and regarded, as is natural from its being the chief seat of expression and the source of the voice. it is also the chief seat of beauty and of ugliness, and throughout the world is the most ornamented.[1326] the face, therefore, will have been subjected during many generations to much closer and more earnest self-attention than any other part of the body; and in accordance with the principle here advanced we can understand why it should be the most liable to blush. although exposure to alternations of temperature, &c., has probably much increased the power of dilatation and contraction in the capillaries of the face and adjoining parts, yet this by itself will hardly account for these parts blushing much more than the rest of the body; for it does not explain the fact of the hands rarely blushing. with europeans the whole body tingles slightly when the face blushes intensely; and with the races of men who habitually go nearly naked, the blushes extend over a much larger surface than with us. these facts are, to a certain extent, intelligible, as the self-attention of primeval man, as well as of the existing races which still go naked, will not have been so exclusively confined to their faces, as is the case with the people who now go clothed. we have seen that in all parts of the world persons who feel shame for some moral delinquency, are apt to avert, bend down, or hide their faces, independently of any thought about their personal appearance. the object can hardly be to conceal their blushes, for the face is thus averted or hidden under circumstances which exclude any desire to conceal shame, as when guilt is fully confessed and repented of. it is, however, probable that primeval man before he had acquired much moral sensitiveness would have been highly sensitive about his personal appearance, at least in reference to the other sex, and he would consequently have felt distress at any depreciatory remarks about his appearance; and this is one form of shame. and as the face is the part of the body which is most regarded, it is intelligible that any one ashamed of his personal appearance would desire to conceal this part of his body. the habit having been thus acquired, would naturally be carried on when shame from strictly moral causes was felt; and it is not easy otherwise to see why under these circumstances there should be a desire to hide the face more than any other part of the body. the habit, so general with every one who feels ashamed, of turning away, or lowering his eyes, or restlessly moving them from side to side, probably follows from each glance directed towards those present, bringing home the conviction that he is intently regarded; and he endeavours, by not looking at those present, and especially not at their eyes, momentarily to escape from this painful conviction. _shyness_.--this odd state of mind, often called shamefacedness, or false shame, or _mauvaise honte_, appears to be one of the most efficient of all the causes of blushing. shyness is, indeed, chiefly recognized by the face reddening, by the eyes being averted or cast down, and by awkward, nervous movements of the body. many a woman blushes from this cause, a hundred, perhaps a thousand times, to once that she blushes from having done anything deserving blame, and of which she is truly ashamed. shyness seems to depend on sensitiveness to the opinion, whether good or bad, of others, more especially with respect to external appearance. strangers neither know nor care anything about our conduct or character, but they may, and often do, criticize our appearance: hence shy persons are particularly apt to be shy and to blush in the presence of strangers. the consciousness of anything peculiar, or even new, in the dress, or any slight blemish on the person, and more especially, on the face--points which are likely to attract the attention of strangers--makes the shy intolerably shy. on the other hand, in those cases in which conduct and not personal appearance is concerned, we are much more apt to be shy in the presence of acquaintances, whose judgment we in some degree value, than in that of strangers. a physician told me that a young man, a wealthy duke, with whom he had travelled as medical attendant, blushed like a girl, when he paid him his fee; yet this young man probably would not have blushed and been shy, had he been paying a bill to a tradesman. some persons, however, are so sensitive, that the mere act of speaking to almost any one is sufficient to rouse their self-consciousness, and a slight blush is the result. disapprobation or ridicule, from our sensitiveness on this head, causes shyness and blushing much more readily than does approbation; though the latter with some persons is highly efficient. the conceited are rarely shy; for they value themselves much too highly to expect depreciation. why a proud man is often shy, as appears to be the case, is not so obvious, unless it be that, with all his self-reliance, he really thinks much about the opinion of others although in a disdainful spirit. persons who are exceedingly shy are rarely shy in the presence of those with whom they are quite familiar, and of whose good opinion and sympathy they are perfectly assured;--for instance, a girl in the presence of her mother. i neglected to inquire in my printed paper whether shyness can be detected in the different races of man; but a hindoo gentleman assured mr. erskine that it is recognizable in his countrymen. shyness, as the derivation of the word indicates in several languages,[1327] is closely related to fear; yet it is distinct from fear in the ordinary sense. a shy man no doubt dreads the notice of strangers, but can hardly be said to be afraid of them, he may be as bold as a hero in battle, and yet have no self-confidence about trifles in the presence of strangers. almost every one is extremely nervous when first addressing a public assembly, and most men remain so throughout their lives; but this appears to depend on the consciousness of a great coming exertion, with its associated effects on the system, rather than on shyness;[1328] although a timid or shy man no doubt suffers on such occasions infinitely more than another. with very young children it is difficult to distinguish between fear and shyness; but this latter feeling with them has often seemed to me to partake of the character of the wildness of an untamed animal. shyness comes on at a very early age. in one of my own children, when two years and three months old, i saw a trace of what certainly appeared to be shyness, directed towards myself after an absence from home of only a week. this was shown not by a blush, but by the eyes being for a few minutes slightly averted from me. i have noticed on other occasions that shyness or shamefacedness and real shame are exhibited in the eyes of young children before they have acquired the power of blushing. as shyness apparently depends on self-attention, we can perceive how right are those who maintain that reprehending children for shyness, instead of doing them any good, does much harm, as it calls their attention still more closely to themselves. it has been well urged that "nothing hurts young people more than to be watched continually about their feelings, to have their countenances scrutinized, and the degrees of their sensibility measured by the surveying eye of the unmerciful spectator. under the constraint of such examinations they can think of nothing but that they are looked at, and feel nothing but shame or apprehension."[1329] _moral causes: guilt_.--with respect to blushing from strictly moral causes, we meet with the same fundamental principle as before, namely, regard for the opinion of others. it is not the conscience which raises a blush, for a man may sincerely regret some slight fault committed in solitude, or he may suffer the deepest remorse for an undetected crime, but he will not blush. "i blush," says dr. burgess,[1330] "in the presence of my accusers." it is not the sense of guilt, but the thought that others think or know us to be guilty which crimsons the face. a man may feel thoroughly ashamed at having told a small falsehood, without blushing; but if he even suspects that he is detected he will instantly blush, especially if detected by one whom he reveres. on the other hand, a man may be convinced that god witnesses all his actions, and he may feel deeply conscious of some fault and pray for forgiveness; but this will not, as a lady who is a great blusher believes, ever excite a blush. the explanation of this difference between the knowledge by god and man of our actions lies, i presume, in man's disapprobation of immoral conduct being somewhat akin in nature to his depreciation of our personal appearance, so that through association both lead to similar results; whereas the disapprobation of god brings up no such association. many a person has blushed intensely when accused of some crime, though completely innocent of it. even the thought, as the lady before referred to has observed to me, that others think that we have made an unkind or stupid remark, is amply sufficient to cause a blush, although we know all the time that we have been completely misunderstood. an action may be meritorious or of an indifferent nature, but a sensitive person, if he suspects that others take a different view of it, will blush. for instance, a lady by herself may give money to a beggar without a trace of a blush, but if others are present, and she doubts whether they approve, or suspects that they think her influenced by display, she will blush. so it will be, if she offers to relieve the distress of a decayed gentlewoman, more particularly of one whom she had previously known under better circumstances, as she cannot then feel sure how her conduct will be viewed. but such cases as these blend into shyness. _breaches of etiquette_.--the rules of _etiquette_ always refer to conduct in the presence of, or towards others. they have no necessary connection with the moral sense, and are often meaningless. nevertheless as they depend on the fixed custom of our equals and superiors, whose opinion we highly regard, they are considered almost as binding as are the laws of honour to a gentleman. consequently the breach of the laws of etiquette, that is, any impoliteness or _gaucherie_, any impropriety, or an inappropriate remark, though quite accidental, will cause the most intense blushing of which a man is capable. even the recollection of such an act, after an interval of many years, will make the whole body to tingle. so strong, also, is the power of sympathy that a sensitive person, as a lady has assured me, will sometimes blush at a flagrant breach of etiquette by a perfect stranger, though the act may in no way concern her. _modesty_.--this is another powerful agent in exciting blushes; but the word modesty includes very different states of the mind. it implies humility, and we often judge of this by persons being greatly pleased and blushing at slight praise, or by being annoyed at praise which seems to them too high according to their own humble standard of themselves. blushing here has the usual signification of regard for the opinion of others. but modesty frequently relates to acts of indelicacy; and indelicacy is an affair of etiquette, as we clearly see with the nations that go altogether or nearly naked. he who is modest, and blushes easily at acts of this nature, does so because they are breaches of a firmly and wisely established etiquette. this is indeed shown by the derivation of the word _modest_ from _modus_, a measure or standard of behaviour. a blush due to this form of modesty is, moreover, apt to be intense, because it generally relates to the opposite sex; and we have seen how in all cases our liability to blush is thus increased. we apply the term 'modest,' as it would appear, to those who have an humble opinion of themselves, and to those who are extremely sensitive about an indelicate word or deed, simply because in both cases blushes are readily excited, for these two frames of mind have nothing else in common. shyness also, from this same cause, is often mistaken for modesty in the sense of humility. some persons flush up, as i have observed and have been assured, at any sudden and disagreeable recollection. the commonest cause seems to be the sudden remembrance of not having done something for another person which had been promised. in this case it may be that the thought passes half unconsciously through the mind, "what will he think of me?" and then the flush would partake of the nature of a true blush. but whether such flushes are in most cases due to the capillary circulation being affected, is very doubtful; for we must remember that almost every strong emotion, such as anger or great joy, acts on the heart, and causes the face to redden. the fact that blushes may be excited in absolute solitude seems opposed to the view here taken, namely that the habit originally arose from thinking about what others think of us. several ladies, who are great blushers, are unanimous in regard to solitude; and some of them believe that they have blushed in the dark. from what mr. forbes has stated with respect to the aymaras, and from my own sensations, i have no doubt that this latter statement is correct. shakspeare, therefore, erred when he made juliet, who was not even by herself, say to romeo (act ii. sc. 2):-- "thou know'st the mask of night is on my face; else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek, for that which thou hast heard me speak to-night." but when a blush is excited in solitude, the cause almost always relates to the thoughts of others about us--to acts done in their presence, or suspected by them; or again when we reflect what others would have thought of us had they known of the act. nevertheless one or two of my informants believe that they have blushed from shame at acts in no way relating to others. if this be so, we must attribute the result to the force of inveterate habit and association, under a state of mind closely analogous to that which ordinarily excites a blush; nor need we feel surprise at this, as even sympathy with another person who commits a flagrant breach of etiquette is believed, as we have just seen, sometimes to cause a blush. finally, then, i conclude that blushing,--whether due to shyness--to shame for a real crime--to shame from a breach of the laws of etiquette--to modesty from humility--to modesty from an indelicacy--depends in all cases on the same principle; this principle being a sensitive regard for the opinion, more particularly for the depreciation of others, primarily in relation to our personal appearance, especially of our faces; and secondarily, through the force of association and habit, in relation to the opinion of others on our conduct. _theory of blushing_.--we have now to consider, why should the thought that others are thinking about us affect our capillary circulation? sir c. bell insists[1331] that blushing "is a provision for expression, as may be inferred from the colour extending only to the surface of the face, neck, and breast, the parts most exposed. it is not acquired; it is from the beginning." dr. burgess believes that it was designed by the creator in "order that the soul might have sovereign power of displaying in the cheeks the various internal emotions of the moral feelings;" so as to serve as a check on ourselves, and as a sign to others, that we were violating rules which ought to be held sacred. gratiolet merely remarks,--"or, comme il est dans l'ordre de la nature que l'etre social le plus intelligent soit aussi le plus intelligible, cette faculte de rougeur et de paleur qui distingue l'homme, est un signe naturel de sa haute perfection." the belief that blushing was specially designed by the creator is opposed to the general theory of evolution, which is now so largely accepted; but it forms no part of my duty here to argue on the general question. those who believe in design, will find it difficult to account for shyness being the most frequent and efficient of all the causes of blushing, as it makes the blusher to suffer and the beholder uncomfortable, without being of the least service to either of them. they will also find it difficult to account for negroes and other dark-coloured races blushing, in whom a change of colour in the skin is scarcely or not at all visible. no doubt a slight blush adds to the beauty of a maiden's face; and the circassian women who are capable of blushing, invariably fetch a higher price in the seraolio of the sultan than less susceptible women.[1332] but the firmest believer in the efficacy of sexual selection will hardly suppose that blushing was acquired as a sexual ornament. this view would also be opposed to what has just been said about the dark-coloured races blushing in an invisible manner. the hypothesis which appears to me the most probable, though it may at first seem rash, is that attention closely directed to any part of the body tends to interfere with the ordinary and tonic contraction of the small arteries of that part. these vessels, in consequence, become at such times more or less relaxed, and are instantly filled with arterial blood. this tendency will have been much strengthened, if frequent attention has been paid during many generations to the same part, owing to nerve-force readily flowing along accustomed channels, and by the power of inheritance. whenever we believe that others are depreciating or even considering our personal appearance, our attention is vividly directed to the outer and visible parts of our bodies; and of all such parts we are most sensitive about our faces, as no doubt has been the case during many past generations. therefore, assuming for the moment that the capillary vessels can be acted on by close attention, those of the face will have become eminently susceptible. through the force of association, the same effects will tend to follow whenever we think that others are considering or censuring our actions or character. as the basis of this theory rests on mental attention having some power to influence the capillary circulation, it will be necessary to give a considerable body of details, bearing more or less directly on this subject. several observers,[1333] who from their wide experience and knowledge are eminently capable of forming a sound judgment, are convinced that attention or consciousness (which latter term sir h. holland thinks the more explicit) concentrated on almost any part of the body produces some direct physical effect on it. this applies to the movements of the involuntary muscles, and of the voluntary muscles when acting involuntarily,--to the secretion of the glands,--to the activity of the senses and sensations,--and even to the nutrition of parts. it is known that the involuntary movements of the heart are affected if close attention be paid to them. gratiolet[1334] gives the case of a man, who by continually watching and counting his own pulse, at last caused one beat out of every six to intermit. on the other hand, my father told me of a careful observer, who certainly had heart-disease and died from it, and who positively stated that his pulse was habitually irregular to an extreme degree; yet to his great disappointment it invariably became regular as soon as my father entered the room. sir h. holland remarks,[1335] that "the effect upon the circulation of a part from the consciousness suddenly directed and fixed upon it, is often obvious and immediate." professor laycock, who has particularly attended to phenomena of this nature,[1336] insists that "when the attention is directed to any portion of the body, innervation and circulation are excited locally, and the functional activity of that portion developed." it is generally believed that the peristaltic movements of the intestines are influenced by attention being paid to them at fixed recurrent periods; and these movements depend on the contraction of unstriped and involuntary muscles. the abnormal action of the voluntary muscles in epilepsy, chorea, and hysteria is known to be influenced by the expectation of an attack, and by the sight of other patients similarly affected.[1337] so it is with the involuntary acts of yawning and laughing. certain glands are much influenced by thinking of them, or of the conditions under which they have been habitually excited. this is familiar to every one in the increased flow of saliva, when the thought, for instance, of intensely acid fruit is kept before the mind. it was shown in our sixth chapter, that an earnest and long-continued desire either to repress, or to increase, the action of the lacrymal glands is effectual. some curious cases have been recorded in the case of women, of the power of the mind on the mammary glands; and still more remarkable ones in relation to the uterine functions.[1339] [1335] 'chapters on mental physiology,' 1858, p. 111. [1336] 'mind find brain,' vol. ii. 1860, p. 327. [1337] 'chapters on mental physiology,' pp. 104-106. [1338] see gratiolet on this subject, de la phys. p. 287. [1339] dr. j. crichton browne, from his observations on the insane, is convinced that attention directed for a prolonged period on any part or organ may ultimately influence its capillary circulation and nutrition. he has given me some extraordinary cases; one of these, which cannot here be related in full, refers to a married woman fifty years of age, who laboured under the firm and long-continued delusion that she was pregnant. when the expected period arrived, she acted precisely as if she had been really delivered of a child, and seemed to suffer extreme pain, so that the perspiration broke out on her forehead. the result was that a state of things returned, continuing for three days, which had ceased during the six previous years. mr. braid gives, in his 'magic, hypnotism,' &c., 1852, p. 95, and in his other works analogous cases, as well as other facts showing the great influence of the will on the mammary glands, even on one breast alone. when we direct our whole attention to any one sense, its acuteness is increased;[1340] and the continued habit of close attention, as with blind people to that of hearing, and with the blind and deaf to that of touch, appears to improve the sense in question permanently. there is, also, some reason to believe, judging from the capacities of different races of man, that the effects are inherited. turning to ordinary sensations, it is well known that pain is increased by attending to it; and sir b. brodie goes so far as to believe that pain may be felt in any part of the body to which attention is closely drawn.[1341] sir h. holland also remarks that we become not only conscious of the existence of a part subjected to concentrated attention, but we experience in it various odd sensations as of weight, heat, cold, tingling, or itching.[1342] lastly, some physiologists maintain that the mind can influence the nutrition of parts. sir j. paget has given a curious instance of the power, not indeed of the mind, but of the nervous system, on the hair. a lady "who is subject to attacks of what is called nervous headache, always finds in the morning after such an one, that some patches of her hair are white, as if powdered with starch. the change is effected in a night, and in a few days after, the hairs gradually regain their dark brownish colour."[1343] we thus see that close attention certainly affects various parts and organs, which are not properly under the control of the will. by what means attention--perhaps the most wonderful of all the wondrous powers of the mind--is effected, is an extremely obscure subject. according to muller,[1344] the process by which the sensory cells of the brain are rendered, through the will, susceptible of receiving more intense and distinct impressions, is closely analogous to that by which the motor cells are excited to send nerve-force to the voluntary muscles. there are many points of analogy in the action of the sensory and motor nerve-cells; for instance, the familiar fact that close attention to any one sense causes fatigue, like the prolonged exertion of any one muscle.[1345] when therefore we voluntarily concentrate our attention on any part of the body, the cells of the brain which receive impressions or sensations from that part are, it is probable, in some unknown manner stimulated into activity. this may account, without any local change in the part to which our attention is earnestly directed, for pain or odd sensations being there felt or increased. if, however, the part is furnished with muscles, we cannot feel sure, as mr. michael foster has remarked to me, that some slight impulse may not be unconsciously sent to such muscles; and this would probably cause an obscure sensation in the part. in a large number of cases, as with the salivary and lacrymal glands, intestinal canal, &c., the power of attention seems to rest, either chiefly, or as some physiologists think, exclusively, on the vaso-motor system being affected in such a manner that more blood is allowed to flow into the capillaries of the part in question. this increased action of the capillaries may in some cases be combined with the simultaneously increased activity of the sensorium. the manner in which the mind affects the vasomotor system may be conceived in the following manner. when we actually taste sour fruit, an impression is sent through the gustatory nerves to a certain part of the sensorium; this transmits nerve-force to the vasomotor centre, which consequently allows the muscular coats of the small arteries that permeate the salivary glands to relax. hence more blood flows into these glands, and they secrete a copious supply of saliva. now it does not seem an improbable assumption, that, when we reflect intently on a sensation, the same part of the sensorium, or a closely connected part of it, is brought into a state of activity, in the same manner as when we actually perceive the sensation. if so, the same cells in the brain will be excited, though, perhaps, in a less degree, by vividly thinking about a sour taste, as by perceiving it; and they will transmit in the one case, as in the other, nerve-force to the vaso-motor centre with the same results. to give another, and, in some respects, more appropriate illustration. if a man stands before a hot fire, his face reddens. this appears to be due, as mr. michael foster informs me, in part to the local action of the heat, and in part to a reflex action from the vaso-motor centres.[1346] in this latter case, the heat affects the nerves of the face; these transmit an impression to the sensory cells of the brain, which act on the vaso-motor centre, and this reacts on the small arteries of the face, relaxing them and allowing them to become filled with blood. here, again, it seems not improbable that if we were repeatedly to concentrate with great earnestness our attention on the recollection of our heated faces, the same part of the sensorium which gives us the consciousness of actual heat would be in some slight degree stimulated, and would in consequence tend to transmit some nerve-force to the vaso-motor centres, so as to relax the capillaries of the face. now as men during endless generations have had their attention often and earnestly directed to their personal appearance, and especially to their faces, any incipient tendency in the facial capillaries to be thus affected will have become in the course of time greatly strengthened through the principles just referred to, namely, nerve-force passing readily along accustomed channels, and inherited habit. thus, as it appears to me, a plausible explanation is afforded of the leading phenomena connected with the act of blushing. _recapitulation_.--men and women, and especially the young, have always valued, in a high degree, their personal appearance; and have likewise regarded the appearance of others. the face has been the chief object of attention, though, when man aboriginally went naked, the whole surface of his body would have been attended to. our self-attention is excited almost exclusively by the opinion of others, for no person living in absolute solitude would care about his appearance. every one feels blame more acutely than praise. now, whenever we know, or suppose, that others are depreciating our personal appearance, our attention is strongly drawn towards ourselves, more especially to our faces. the probable effect of this will be, as has just been explained, to excite into activity that part of the sensorium, which receives the sensory nerves of the face; and this will react through the vaso-motor system on the facial capillaries. by frequent reiteration during numberless generations, the process will have become so habitual, in association with the belief that others are thinking of us, that even a suspicion of their depreciation suffices to relax the capillaries, without any conscious thought about our faces. with some sensitive persons it is enough even to notice their dress to produce the same effect. through the force, also, of association and inheritance our capillaries are relaxed, whenever we know, or imagine, that any one is blaming, though in silence, our actions, thoughts, or character; and, again, when we are highly praised. on this hypothesis we can understand how it is that the face blushes much more than any other part of the body, though the whole surface is somewhat affected, more especially with the races which still go nearly naked. it is not at all surprising that the dark-coloured races should blush, though no change of colour is visible in their skins. from the principle of inheritance it is not surprising that persons born blind should blush. we can understand why the young are much more affected than the old, and women more than men; and why the opposite sexes especially excite each other's blushes. it becomes obvious why personal remarks should be particularly liable to cause blushing, and why the most powerful of all the causes is shyness; for shyness relates to the presence and opinion of others, and the shy are always more or less self-conscious. with respect to real shame from moral delinquencies, we can perceive why it is not guilt, but the thought that others think us guilty, which raises a blush. a man reflecting on a crime committed in solitude, and stung by his conscience, does not blush; yet he will blush under the vivid recollection of a detected fault, or of one committed in the presence of others, the degree of blushing being closely related to the feeling of regard for those who have detected, witnessed, or suspected his fault. breaches of conventional rules of conduct, if they are rigidly insisted on by our equals or superiors, often cause more intense blushes even than a detected crime, and an act which is really criminal, if not blamed by our equals, hardly raises a tinge of colour on our cheeks. modesty from humility, or from an indelicacy, excites a vivid blush, as both relate to the judgment or fixed customs of others. from the intimate sympathy which exists between the capillary circulation of the surface of the head and of the brain, whenever there is intense blushing, there will be some, and often great, confusion of mind. this is frequently accompanied by awkward movements, and sometimes by the involuntary twitching of certain muscles. as blushing, according to this hypothesis, is an indirect result of attention, originally directed to our personal appearance, that is to the surface of the body, and more especially to the face, we can understand the meaning of the gestures which accompany blushing throughout the world. these consist in hiding the face, or turning it towards the ground, or to one side. the eyes are generally averted or are restless, for to look at the man who causes us to feel shame or shyness, immediately brings home in an intolerable manner the consciousness that his gaze is directed on us. through the principle of associated habit, the same movements of the face and eyes are practised, and can, indeed, hardly be avoided, whenever we know or believe that, others are blaming, or too strongly praising, our moral conduct. chapter xiv. -- concluding remarks and summary. the three leading principles which have determined the chief movements of expression--their inheritance--on the part which the will and intention have played in the acquirement of various expressions--the instinctive recognition of expression--the bearing of our subject on the specific unity of the races of man--on the successive acquirement of various expressions by the progenitors of man--the importance of expression--conclusion. i have now described, to the best of my ability, the chief expressive actions in man, and in some few of the lower animals. i have also attempted to explain the origin or development of these actions through the three principles given in the first chapter. the first of these principles is, that movements which are serviceable in gratifying some desire, or in relieving some sensation, if often repeated, become so habitual that they are performed, whether or not of any service, whenever the same desire or sensation is felt, even in a very weak degree. our second principle is that of antithesis. the habit of voluntarily performing opposite movements under opposite impulses has become firmly established in us by the practice of our whole lives. hence, if certain actions have been regularly performed, in accordance with our first principle, under a certain frame of mind, there will be a strong and involuntary tendency to the performance of directly opposite actions, whether or not these are of any use, under the excitement of an opposite frame of mind. our third principle is the direct action of the excited nervous system on the body, independently of the will, and independently, in large part, of habit. experience shows that nerve-force is generated and set free whenever the cerebro-spinal system is excited. the direction which this nerve-force follows is necessarily determined by the lines of connection between the nerve-cells, with each other and with various parts of the body. but the direction is likewise much influenced by habit; inasmuch as nerve-force passes readily along accustomed channels. the frantic and senseless actions of an enraged man may be attributed in part to the undirected flow of nerve-force, and in part to the effects of habit, for these actions often vaguely represent the act of striking. they thus pass into gestures included under our first principle; as when an indignant man unconsciously throws himself into a fitting attitude for attacking his opponent, though without any intention of making an actual attack. we see also the influence of habit in all the emotions and sensations which are called exciting; for they have assumed this character from having habitually led to energetic action; and action affects, in an indirect manner, the respiratory and circulatory system; and the latter reacts on the brain. whenever these emotions or sensations are even slightly felt by us, though they may not at the time lead to any exertion, our whole system is nevertheless disturbed through the force of habit and association. other emotions and sensations are called depressing, because they have not habitually led to energetic action, excepting just at first, as in the case of extreme pain, fear, and grief, and they have ultimately caused complete exhaustion; they are consequently expressed chiefly by negative signs and by prostration. again, there are other emotions, such as that of affection, which do not commonly lead to action of any kind, and consequently are not exhibited by any strongly marked outward signs. affection indeed, in as far as it is a pleasurable sensation, excites the ordinary signs of pleasure. on the other hand, many of the effects due to the excitement of the nervous system seem to be quite independent of the flow of nerve-force along the channels which have been rendered habitual by former exertions of the will. such effects, which often reveal the state of mind of the person thus affected, cannot at present be explained; for instance, the change of colour in the hair from extreme terror or grief,--the cold sweat and the trembling of the muscles from fear,--the modified secretions of the intestinal canal,--and the failure of certain glands to act. notwithstanding that much remains unintelligible in our present subject, so many expressive movements and actions can be explained to a certain extent through the above three principles, that we may hope hereafter to see all explained by these or by closely analogous principles. actions of all kinds, if regularly accompanying any state of the mind, are at once recognized as expressive. these may consist of movements of any part of the body, as the wagging of a dog's tail, the shrugging of a man's shoulders, the erection of the hair, the exudation of perspiration, the state of the capillary circulation, laboured breathing, and the use of the vocal or other sound-producing instruments. even insects express anger, terror, jealousy, and love by their stridulation. with man the respiratory organs are of especial importance in expression, not only in a direct, but in a still higher degree in an indirect manner. few points are more interesting in our present subject than the extraordinarily complex chain of events which lead to certain expressive movements. take, for instance, the oblique eyebrows of a man suffering from grief or anxiety. when infants scream loudly from hunger or pain, the circulation is affected, and the eyes tend to become gorged with blood: consequently the muscles surrounding the eyes are strongly contracted as a protection: this action, in the course of many generations, has become firmly fixed and inherited: but when, with advancing years and culture, the habit of screaming is partially repressed, the muscles round the eyes still tend to contract, whenever even slight distress is felt: of these muscles, the pyramidals of the nose are less under the control of the will than are the others and their contraction can be checked only by that of the central fasciae of the frontal muscle: these latter fasciae draw up the inner ends of the eyebrows, and wrinkle the forehead in a peculiar manner, which we instantly recognize as the expression of grief or anxiety. slight movements, such as these just described, or the scarcely perceptible drawing down of the corners of the mouth, are the last remnants or rudiments of strongly marked and intelligible movements. they are as full of significance to us in regard to expression, as are ordinary rudiments to the naturalist in the classification and genealogy of organic beings. that the chief expressive actions, exhibited by man and by the lower animals, are now innate or inherited,--that is, have not been learnt by the individual,--is admitted by every one. so little has learning or imitation to do with several of them that they are from the earliest days and throughout life quite beyond our control; for instance, the relaxation of the arteries of the skin in blushing, and the increased action of the heart in anger. we may see children, only two or three years old, and even those born blind, blushing from shame; and the naked scalp of a very young infant reddens from passion. infants scream from pain directly after birth, and all their features then assume the same form as during subsequent years. these facts alone suffice to show that many of our most important expressions have not been learnt; but it is remarkable that some, which are certainly innate, require practice in the individual, before they are performed in a full and perfect manner; for instance, weeping and laughing. the inheritance of most of our expressive actions explains the fact that those born blind display them, as i hear from the rev. r. h. blair, equally well with those gifted with eyesight. we can thus also understand the fact that the young and the old of widely different races, both with man and animals, express the same state of mind by the same movements. we are so familiar with the fact of young and old animals displaying their feelings in the same manner, that we hardly perceive how remarkable it is that a young puppy should wag its tail when pleased, depress its ears and uncover its canine teeth when pretending to be savage, just like an old dog; or that a kitten should arch its little back and erect its hair when frightened and angry, like an old cat. when, however, we turn to less common gestures in ourselves, which we are accustomed to look at as artificial or conventional,--such as shrugging the shoulders, as a sign of impotence, or the raising the arms with open hands and extended fingers, as a sign of wonder,--we feel perhaps too much surprise at finding that they are innate. that these and some other gestures are inherited, we may infer from their being performed by very young children, by those born blind, and by the most widely distinct races of man. we should also bear in mind that new and highly peculiar tricks, in association with certain states of the mind, are known to have arisen in certain individuals, and to have been afterwards transmitted to their offspring, in some cases, for more than one generation. certain other gestures, which seem to us so natural that we might easily imagine that they were innate, apparently have been learnt like the words of a language. this seems to be the case with the joining of the uplifted hands, and the turning up of the eyes, in prayer. so it is with kissing as a mark of affection; but this is innate, in so far as it depends on the pleasure derived from contact with a beloved person. the evidence with respect to the inheritance of nodding and shaking the head, as signs of affirmation and negation, is doubtful; for they are not universal, yet seem too general to have been independently acquired by all the individuals of so many races. we will now consider how far the will and consciousness have come into play in the development of the various movements of expression. as far as we can judge, only a few expressive movements, such as those just referred to, are learnt by each individual; that is, were consciously and voluntarily performed during the early years of life for some definite object, or in imitation of others, and then became habitual. the far greater number of the movements of expression, and all the more important ones, are, as we have seen, innate or inherited; and such cannot be said to depend on the will of the individual. nevertheless, all those included under our first principle were at first voluntarily performed for a definite object,--namely, to escape some danger, to relieve some distress, or to gratify some desire. for instance, there can hardly be a doubt that the animals which fight with their teeth, have acquired the habit of drawing back their ears closely to their heads, when feeling savage, from their progenitors having voluntarily acted in this manner in order to protect their ears from being torn by their antagonists; for those animals which do not fight with their teeth do not thus express a savage state of mind. we may infer as highly probable that we ourselves have acquired the habit of contracting the muscles round the eyes, whilst crying gently, that is, without the utterance of any loud sound, from our progenitors, especially during infancy, having experienced, during the act of screaming, an uncomfortable sensation in their eyeballs. again, some highly expressive movements result from the endeavour to cheek or prevent other expressive movements; thus the obliquity of the eyebrows and the drawing down of the corners of the mouth follow from the endeavour to prevent a screaming-fit from coming on, or to cheek it after it has come on. here it is obvious that the consciousness and will must at first have come into play; not that we are conscious in these or in other such cases what muscles are brought into action, any more than when we perform the most ordinary voluntary movements. with respect to the expressive movements due to the principle of antithesis, it is clear that the will has intervened, though in a remote and indirect manner. so again with the movements coming under our third principle; these, in as far as they are influenced by nerve-force readily passing along habitual channels, have been determined by former and repeated exertions of the will. the effects indirectly due to this latter agency are often combined in a complex manner, through the force of habit and association, with those directly resulting from the excitement of the cerebro-spinal system. this seems to be the case with the increased action of the heart under the influence of any strong emotion. when an animal erects its hair, assumes a threatening attitude, and utters fierce sounds, in order to terrify an enemy, we see a curious combination of movements which were originally voluntary with those that are involuntary. it is, however, possible that even strictly involuntary actions, such as the erection of the hair, may have been affected by the mysterious power of the will. some expressive movements may have arisen spontaneously, in association with certain states of the mind, like the tricks lately referred to, and afterwards been inherited. but i know of no evidence rendering this view probable. the power of communication between the members of the same tribe by means of language has been of paramount importance in the development of man; and the force of language is much aided by the expressive movements of the face and body. we perceive this at once when we converse on an important subject with any person whose face is concealed. nevertheless there are no grounds, as far as i can discover, for believing that any muscle has been developed or even modified exclusively for the sake of expression. the vocal and other sound-producing organs, by which various expressive noises are produced, seem to form a partial exception; but i have elsewhere attempted to show that these organs were first developed for sexual purposes, in order that one sex might call or charm the other. nor can i discover grounds for believing that any inherited movement, which now serves as a means of expression, was at first voluntarily and consciously performed for this special purpose,--like some of the gestures and the finger-language used by the deaf and dumb. on the contrary, every true or inherited movement of expression seems to have had some natural and independent origin. but when once acquired, such movements may be voluntarily and consciously employed as a means of communication. even infants, if carefully attended to, find out at a very early age that their screaming brings relief, and they soon voluntarily practise it. we may frequently see a person voluntarily raising his eyebrows to express surprise, or smiling to express pretended satisfaction and acquiescence. a man often wishes to make certain gestures conspicuous or demonstrative, and will raise his extended arms with widely opened fingers above his head, to show astonishment, or lift his shoulders to his ears, to show that he cannot or will not do something. the tendency to such movements will be strengthened or increased by their being thus voluntarily and repeatedly performed; and the effects may be inherited. it is perhaps worth consideration whether movements at first used only by one or a few individuals to express a certain state of mind may not sometimes have spread to others, and ultimately have become universal, through the power of conscious and unconscious imitation. that there exists in man a strong tendency to imitation, independently of the conscious will, is certain. this is exhibited in the most extraordinary manner in certain brain diseases, especially at the commencement of inflammatory softening of the brain, and has been called the "echo sign." patients thus affected imitate, without understanding every absurd gesture which is made, and every word which is uttered near them, even in a foreign language.[1401] in the case of animals, the jackal and wolf have learnt under confinement to imitate the barking of the dog. how the barking of the dog, which serves to express various emotions and desires, and which is so remarkable from having been acquired since the animal was domesticated, and from being inherited in different degrees by different breeds, was first learnt we do not know; but may we not suspect that imitation has had something to do with its acquisition, owing to dogs having long lived in strict association with so loquacious an animal as man? in the course of the foregoing remarks and throughout this volume, i have often felt much difficulty about the proper application of the terms, will, consciousness, and intention. actions, which were at first voluntary, soon became habitual, and at last hereditary, and may then be performed even in opposition to the will. although they often reveal the state of the mind, this result was not at first either intended or expected. even such words as that "certain movements serve as a means of expression," are apt to mislead, as they imply that this was their primary purpose or object. this, however, seems rarely or never to have been the case; the movements having been at first either of some direct use, or the indirect effect of the excited state of the sensorium. an infant may scream either intentionally or instinctively to show that it wants food; but it has no wish or intention to draw its features into the peculiar form which so plainly indicates misery; yet some of the most characteristic expressions exhibited by man are derived from the act of screaming, as has been explained. although most of our expressive actions are innate or instinctive, as is admitted by everyone, it is a different question whether we have any instinctive power of recognizing them. this has generally been assumed to be the case; but the assumption has been strongly controverted by m. lemoine.[1402] monkeys soon learn to distinguish, not only the tones of voice of their masters, but the expression of their faces, as is asserted by a careful observer.[1403] dogs well know the difference between caressing and threatening gestures or tones; and they seem to recognize a compassionate tone. but as far as i can make out, after repeated trials, they do not understand any movement confined to the features, excepting a smile or laugh; and this they appear, at least in some cases, to recognize. this limited amount of knowledge has probably been gained, both by monkeys and dogs, through their associating harsh or kind treatment with our actions; and the knowledge certainly is not instinctive. children, no doubt, would soon learn the movements of expression in their elders in the same manner as animals learn those of man. moreover, when a child cries or laughs, he knows in a general manner what he is doing and what he feels; so that a very small exertion of reason would tell him what crying or laughing meant in others. but the question is, do our children acquire their knowledge of expression solely by experience through the power of association and reason? as most of the movements of expression must have been gradually acquired, afterwards becoming instinctive, there seems to be some degree of _a priori_ probability that their recognition would likewise have become instinctive. there is, at least, no greater difficulty in believing this than in admitting that, when a female quadruped first bears young, she knows the cry of distress of her offspring, or than in admitting that many animals instinctively recognize and fear their enemies; and of both these statements there can be no reasonable doubt. it is however extremely difficult to prove that our children instinctively recognize any expression. i attended to this point in my first-born infant, who could not have learnt anything by associating with other children, and i was convinced that he understood a smile and received pleasure from seeing one, answering it by another, at much too early an age to have learnt anything by experience. when this child was about four months old, i made in his presence many odd noises and strange grimaces, and tried to look savage; but the noises, if not too loud, as well as the grimaces, were all taken as good jokes; and i attributed this at the time to their being preceded or accompanied by smiles. when five months old, he seemed to understand a compassionate, expression and tone of voice. when a few days over six months old, his nurse pretended to cry, and i saw that his face instantly assumed a melancholy expression, with the corners of the mouth strongly depressed; now this child could rarely have seen any other child crying, and never a grown-up person crying, and i should doubt whether at so early an age he could have reasoned on the subject. therefore it seems to me that an innate feeling must have told him that the pretended crying of his nurse expressed grief; and this through the instinct of sympathy excited grief in him. m. lemoine argues that, if man possessed an innate knowledge of expression, authors and artists would not have found it so difficult, as is notoriously the case, to describe and depict the characteristic signs of each particular state of mind. but this does not seem to me a valid argument. we may actually behold the expression changing in an unmistakable manner in a man or animal, and yet be quite unable, as i know from experience, to analyse the nature of the change. in the two photographs given by duchenne of the same old man (plate iii. figs. 5 and 6), almost every one recognized that the one represented a true, and the other a false smile; but i have found it very difficult to decide in what the whole amount of difference consists. it has often struck me as a curious fact that so many shades of expression are instantly recognized without any conscious process of analysis on our part. no one, i believe, can clearly describe a sullen or sly expression; yet many observers are unanimous that these expressions can be recognized in the various races of man. almost everyone to whom i showed duchenne's photograph of the young man with oblique eyebrows (plate ii. fig. 2) at once declared that it expressed grief or some such feeling; yet probably not one of these persons, or one out of a thousand persons, could beforehand have told anything precise about the obliquity of the eyebrows with their inner ends puckered, or about the rectangular furrows on the forehead. so it is with many other expressions, of which i have had practical experience in the trouble requisite in instructing others what points to observe. if, then, great ignorance of details does not prevent our recognizing with certainty and promptitude various expressions, i do not see how this ignorance can be advanced as an argument that our knowledge, though vague and general, is not innate. i have endeavoured to show in considerable detail that all the chief expressions exhibited by man are the same throughout the world. this fact is interesting, as it affords a new argument in favour of the several races being descended from a single parent-stock, which must have been almost completely human in structure, and to a large extent in mind, before the period at which the races diverged from each other. no doubt similar structures, adapted for the same purpose, have often been independently acquired through variation and natural selection by distinct species; but this view will not explain close similarity between distinct species in a multitude of unimportant details. now if we bear in mind the numerous points of structure having no relation to expression, in which all the races of man closely agree, and then add to them the numerous points, some of the highest importance and many of the most trifling value, on which the movements of expression directly or indirectly depend, it seems to me improbable in the highest degree that so much similarity, or rather identity of structure, could have been acquired by independent means. yet this must have been the case if the races of man are descended from several aboriginally distinct species. it is far more probable that the many points of close similarity in the various races are due to inheritance from a single parent-form, which had already assumed a human character. it is a curious, though perhaps an idle speculation, how early in the long line of our progenitors the various expressive movements, now exhibited by man, were successively acquired. the following remarks will at least serve to recall some of the chief points discussed in this volume. we may confidently believe that laughter, as a sign of pleasure or enjoyment, was practised by our progenitors long before they deserved to be called human; for very many kinds of monkeys, when pleased, utter a reiterated sound, clearly analogous to our laughter, often accompanied by vibratory movements of their jaws or lips, with the corners of the mouth drawn backwards and upwards, by the wrinkling of the cheeks, and even by the brightening of the eyes. we may likewise infer that fear was expressed from an extremely remote period, in almost the same manner as it now is by man; namely, by trembling, the erection of the hair, cold perspiration, pallor, widely opened eyes, the relaxation of most of the muscles, and by the whole body cowering downwards or held motionless. suffering, if great, will from the first have caused screams or groans to be uttered, the body to be contorted, and the teeth to be ground together. but our progenitors will not have exhibited those highly expressive movements of the features which accompany screaming and crying until their circulatory and respiratory organs, and the muscles surrounding the eyes, had acquired their present structure. the shedding of tears appears to have originated through reflex action from the spasmodic contraction of the eyelids, together perhaps with the eyeballs becoming gorged with blood during the act of screaming. therefore weeping probably came on rather late in the line of our descent; and this conclusion agrees with the fact that our nearest allies, the anthropomorphous apes, do not weep. but we must here exercise some caution, for as certain monkeys, which are not closely related to man, weep, this habit might have been developed long ago in a sub-branch of the group from which man is derived. our early progenitors, when suffering from grief or anxiety, would not have made their eyebrows oblique, or have drawn down the corners of their mouth, until they had acquired the habit of endeavouring to restrain their screams. the expression, therefore, of grief and anxiety is eminently human. rage will have been expressed at a very early period by threatening or frantic gestures, by the reddening of the skin, and by glaring eyes, but not by frowning. for the habit of frowning seems to have been acquired chiefly from the corrugators being the first muscles to contract round the eyes, whenever during infancy pain, anger, or distress is felt, and there consequently is a near approach to screaming; and partly from a frown serving as a shade in difficult and intent vision. it seems probable that this shading action would not have become habitual until man had assumed a completely upright position, for monkeys do not frown when exposed to a glaring light. our early progenitors, when enraged, would probably have exposed their teeth more freely than does man, even when giving full vent to his rage, as with the insane. we may, also, feel almost certain that they would have protruded their lips, when sulky or disappointed, in a greater degree than is the case with our own children, or even with the children of existing savage races. our early progenitors, when indignant or moderately angry, would not have held their heads erect, opened their chests, squared their shoulders, and clenched their fists, until they had acquired the ordinary carriage and upright attitude of man, and had learnt to fight with their fists or clubs. until this period had arrived the antithetical gesture of shrugging the shoulders, as a sign of impotence or of patience, would not have been developed. from the same reason astonishment would not then have been expressed by raising the arms with open hands and extended fingers. nor, judging from the actions of monkeys, would astonishment have been exhibited by a widely opened mouth; but the eyes would have been opened and the eyebrows arched. disgust would have been shown at a very early period by movements round the mouth, like those of vomiting,--that is, if the view which i have suggested respecting the source of the expression is correct, namely, that our progenitors had the power, and used it, of voluntarily and quickly rejecting any food from their stomachs which they disliked. but the more refined manner of showing contempt or disdain, by lowering the eyelids, or turning away the eyes and face, as if the despised person were not worth looking at, would not probably have been acquired until a much later period. of all expressions, blushing seems to be the most strictly human; yet it is common to all or nearly all the races of man, whether or not any change of colour is visible in their skin. the relaxation of the small arteries of the surface, on which blushing depends, seems to have primarily resulted from earnest attention directed to the appearance of our own persons, especially of our faces, aided by habit, inheritance, and the ready flow of nerve-force along accustomed channels; and afterwards to have been extended by the power of association to self-attention directed to moral conduct. it can hardly be doubted that many animals are capable of appreciating beautiful colours and even forms, as is shown by the pains which the individuals of one sex take in displaying their beauty before those of the opposite sex. but it does not seem possible that any animal, until its mental powers had been developed to an equal or nearly equal degree with those of man, would have closely considered and been sensitive about its own personal appearance. therefore we may conclude that blushing originated at a very late period in the long line of our descent. from the various facts just alluded to, and given in the course of this volume, it follows that, if the structure of our organs of respiration and circulation had differed in only a slight degree from the state in which they now exist, most of our expressions would have been wonderfully different. a very slight change in the course of the arteries and veins which run to the head, would probably have prevented the blood from accumulating in our eyeballs during violent expiration; for this occurs in extremely few quadrupeds. in this case we should not have displayed some of our most characteristic expressions. if man had breathed water by the aid of external branchiae (though the idea is hardly conceivable), instead of air through his mouth and nostrils, his features would not have expressed his feelings much more efficiently than now do his hands or limbs. rage and disgust, however, would still have been shown by movements about the lips and mouth, and the eyes would have become brighter or duller according to the state of the circulation. if our ears had remained movable, their movements would have been highly expressive, as is the case with all the animals which fight with their teeth; and we may infer that our early progenitors thus fought, as we still uncover the canine tooth on one side when we sneer at or defy any one, and we uncover all our teeth when furiously enraged. the movements of expression in the face and body, whatever their origin may have been, are in themselves of much importance for our welfare. they serve as the first means of communication between the mother and her infant; she smiles approval, and thus encourages her child on the right path, or frowns disapproval. we readily perceive sympathy in others by their expression; our sufferings are thus mitigated and our pleasures increased; and mutual good feeling is thus strengthened. the movements of expression give vividness and energy to our spoken words. they reveal the thoughts and intentions of others more truly than do words, which may be falsified. whatever amount of truth the so-called science of physiognomy may contain, appears to depend, as haller long ago remarked,[1404] on different persons bringing into frequent use different facial muscles, according to their dispositions; the development of these muscles being perhaps thus increased, and the lines or furrows on the face, due to their habitual contraction, being thus rendered deeper and more conspicuous. the free expression by outward signs of an emotion intensifies it. on the other hand, the repression, as far as this is possible, of all outward signs softens our emotions.[1405] he who gives way to violent gestures will increase his rage; he who does not control the signs of fear will experience fear in a greater degree; and he who remains passive when overwhelmed with grief loses his best chance of recovering elasticity of mind. these results follow partly from the intimate relation which exists between almost all the emotions and their outward manifestations; and partly from the direct influence of exertion on the heart, and consequently on the brain. even the simulation of an emotion tends to arouse it in our minds. shakespeare, who from his wonderful knowledge of the human mind ought to be an excellent judge, says:-- is it not monstrous that this player here, but in a fiction, in a dream of passion, could force his soul so to his own conceit, that, from her working, all his visage wann'd; tears in his eyes, distraction in 's aspect, a broken voice, and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit? and all for nothing! _hamlet_, act ii. sc. 2. we have seen that the study of the theory of expression confirms to a certain limited extent the conclusion that man is derived from some lower animal form, and supports the belief of the specific or sub-specific unity of the several races; but as far as my judgment serves, such confirmation was hardly needed. we have also seen that expression in itself, or the language of the emotions, as it has sometimes been called, is certainly of importance for the welfare of mankind. to understand, as far as possible, the source or origin of the various expressions which may be hourly seen on the faces of the men around us, not to mention our domesticated animals, ought to possess much interest for us. from these several causes, we may conclude that the philosophy of our subject has well deserved the attention which it has already received from several excellent observers, and that it deserves still further attention, especially from any able physiologist. footnotes: [footnote 1: j. parsons, in his paper in the appendix to the 'philosophical transactions' for 1746, p. 41, gives a list of forty-one old authors who have written on expression.] [footnote 2: conferences sur l'expression des differents caracteres des passions.' paris, 4to, 1667. i always quote from the republication of the 'conferences' in the edition of lavater, by moreau, which appeared in 1820, as given in vol. ix. p. 257.] [footnote 3: 'discours par pierre camper sur le moyen de representer les diverses passions,' &c. 1792. 1844] [footnote 4: i always quote from the third edition, 1844, which was published after the death of sir c. bell, and contains his latest corrections. the first edition of 1806 is much inferior in merit, and does not include some of his more important views.] [footnote 5: 'de la physionomie et de la parole,' par albert lemoine, 1865, p. 101.] [footnote 6: 'l'art de connaitre les hommes,' &c., par g. lavater.] [footnote 7: 'handbuch der systematischen anatomie des menschen.' band i. dritte abtheilung, 1858.] [footnote 8: 'the senses and the intellect,' 2nd edit. 1864, pp. 96 and 288. the preface to the first edition of this work is dated june, 1855. see also the 2nd edition of mr. bain's work on the 'emotions and will.'] [footnote 9: 'the anatomy of expression,' 3rd edit. p. 121.] [footnote 10: 'essays, scientific, political, and speculative,' second series, 1863, p. 111. there is a discussion on laughter in the first series of essays, which discussion seems to me of very inferior value.] [footnote 11: since the publication of the essay just referred to, mr. spencer has written another, on "morals and moral sentiments," in the 'fortnightly review,' april 1, 1871, p. 426. he has, also, now published his final conclusions in vol. ii. of the second edit. of the 'principles of psychology,' 1872, p. 539. i may state, in order that i may not be accused of trespassing on mr. spencer's domain, that i announced in my 'descent of man,' that i had then written a part of the present volume: my first ms. notes on the subject of expression bear the date of the year 1838.] [footnote 12: 'anatomy of expression,' 3rd edit. pp. 98, 121, 131.] [footnote 13: professor owen expressly states (proc. zoolog. soc. 1830, p. 28) that this is the case with respect to the orang, and specifies all the more important muscles which are well known to serve with man for the expression of his feelings. see, also, a description of several of the facial muscles in the chimpanzee, by prof. macalister, in 'annals and magazine of natural history,' vol. vii. may, 1871, p. 342.] [footnote 14: 'anatomy of expression,' pp. 121, 138.] [footnote 15: 'de la physionomie,' pp. 12, 73.] [footnote 16: 'mecanisme de la physionomie humaine,' 8vo edit. p. 31.] [footnote 17: 'elements of physiology,' english translation, vol. ii. p. 934.] [footnote 18: 'anatomy of expression,' 3rd edit. p. 198.] [footnote 19: see remarks to this effect in lessing's 'lacooon,' translated by w. ross, 1836, p. 19.] [footnote 20: mr. partridge in todd's 'cyclopaedia of anatomy and physiology,' vol. ii. p. 227.] [footnote 21: 'la physionomie,' par g. lavater, tom. iv. 1820, p. 274. on the number of the facial muscles, see vol. iv. pp. 209-211.] [footnote 22: 'mimik und physiognomik,' 1867, s. 91.] [footnote 101: mr. herbert spencer ('essays,' second series, 1863, p. 138) has drawn a clear distinction between emotions and sensations, the latter being "generated in our corporeal framework." he classes as feelings both emotions and-sensations.] [footnote 102: muller, 'elements of physiology,' eng. translat. vol. ii. p. 939. see also mr. h. spencer's interesting speculations on the same subject, and on the genesis of nerves, in his 'principles of biology,' vol. ii. p. 346;

"many years after his death, his son married a lady who had never heard of the family incident. she, however, observed precisely the same peculiarity in her husband; but his nose, from not being particularly prominent, has never as yet suffered from the blows. the trick does not occur when he is half-asleep, as, for example, when dozing in his arm-chair, but the moment he is fast asleep it is apt to begin. it is, as with his father, intermittent; sometimes ceasing for many nights, and sometimes almost incessant during a part of every night. it is performed, as it was by his father, with his right hand. "one of his children, a girl, has inherited the same trick. she performs it, likewise, with the right hand, but in a slightly modified form; for, after raising the arm, she does not allow the wrist to drop upon the bridge of the nose, but the palm of the half-closed hand falls over and down the nose, striking it rather rapidly. it is also very intermittent with this child, not occurring for periods of some months, but sometimes occurring almost incessantly."] [footnote 109: prof. huxley remarks ('elementary physiology,' 5th edit. p. 305) that reflex actions proper to the spinal cord are natural;

but what this is i cannot say. he has given a figure (album, fig. 48) in which one half of the face is made, by galvanizing the proper muscles, to smile; whilst the other half is similarly made to begin crying. almost all those (viz. nineteen out of twenty-one persons) to whom i showed the smiling half of the face instantly recognized the expression; but, with respect to the other half, only six persons out of twenty-one recognized it,--that is, if we accept such terms as "grief," "misery," "annoyance," as correct;--whereas, fifteen persons were ludicrously mistaken; some of them saying the face expressed "fun," "satisfaction," "cunning," "disgust," &c. we may infer from this that there is something wrong in the expression. some of the fifteen persons may, however, have been partly misled by not expecting to see an old man crying, and by tears not being secreted. with respect to another figure by dr. duchenne (fig. 49), in which the muscles of half the face are galvanized in order to represent a man beginning to cry, with the eyebrow on the same side rendered oblique, which is characteristic of misery, the expression was recognized by a greater proportional number of persons. out of twenty-three persons, fourteen answered correctly, "sorrow," "distress," "grief," "just going to cry," "endurance of pain," &c. on the other hand, nine persons either could form no opinion or were entirely wrong, answering, "cunning leer," "jocund," "looking at an intense light," "looking at a distant object," &c.] [footnote 605: mrs. gaskell, 'mary barton,' new edit. p. 84.] [footnote 606: 'mimik und physiognomik,' 1867, s. 102. duchenne, mecanisme de la phys. humaine, album, p. 34.] [footnote 607: dr. duchenne makes this remark, ibid. p. 39.] [footnote 608: 'the origin of civilization,' 1870, p. 355.] [footnote 609: see, for instance, mr. marshall's account of an idiot in philosoph. transact. 1864, p. 526. with respect to cretins, see dr. piderit, 'mimik und physiognomik,' 1867, s. 61.] [footnote 610: 'new zealand and its inhabitants,' 1855, p. 175.] [footnote 611: 'de la physionomie,' 1865, p. 126.] [footnote 612: 'the anatomy of expression,' 1844, p. 106. see also his paper in the 'philosophical transactions,' 1822, p. 284, ibid. 1823, pp. 166 and 289. also 'the nervous system of the human body,' 3rd edit. 1836, p. 175.] [footnote 613: see dr. brinton's account of the act of vomiting, in todd's cyclop. of anatomy and physiology, 1859, vol. v. supplement, p. 318.] [footnote 614: i am greatly indebted to mr. bowman for having introduced me to prof. donders, and for his aid in persuading this great physiologist to undertake the investigation of the present subject. i am likewise much indebted to mr. bowman for having given me, with the utmost kindness, information on many points.] [footnote 615: this memoir first appeared in the 'nederlandsch archief voor genees en natuurkiinde,' deel 5, 1870. it has been translated by dr. w. d. moore, under the title of "on the action of the eyelids in determination of blood from expiratory effort," in 'archives of medicine,' edited by dr. l. s. beale, 1870, vol. v. p. 20.] [footnote 616: prof. donders remarks (ibid. p. 28), that, "after injury to the eye, after operations, and in some forms of internal inflammation, we attach great value to the uniform support of the closed eyelids, and we increase this in many instances by the application of a bandage. in both cases we carefully endeavour to avoid great expiratory pressure, the disadvantage of which is well known." mr. bowman informs me that in the excessive photophobia, accompanying what is called scrofulous ophthalmia in children, when the light is so very painful that during weeks or months it is constantly excluded by the most forcible closure of the lids, he has often been struck on opening the lids by the paleness of the eye,--not an unnatural paleness, but an absence of the redness that might have been expected when the surface is somewhat inflamed, as is then usually the case; and this paleness he is inclined to attribute to the forcible closure of the eyelids.] [footnote 617: donders, ibid. p. 36.] [footnote 618: mr. hensleigh wedgwood (dict. of english etymology, 1859, vol. i. p. 410) says, "the verb to weep comes from anglo-saxon _wop_, the primary meaning of which is simply outcry."] [footnote 619: 'de la physionomie,' 1865, p. 217.] [footnote 620: 'ceylon,' 3rd edit. 1859, vol. ii. pp. 364, 376. i applied to mr. thwaites, in ceylon, for further information with respect to the weeping of the elephant; and in consequence received a letter from the rev. mr glenie, who, with others, kindly observed for me a herd of recently captured elephants. these, when irritated, screamed violently; but it is remarkable that they never when thus screaming contracted the muscles round the eyes. nor did they shed tears; and the native hunters asserted that they had never observed elephants weeping. nevertheless, it appears to me impossible to doubt sir e. tennent's distinct details about their weeping, supported as they are by the positive assertion of the keeper in the zoological gardens. it is certain that the two elephants in the gardens, when they began to trumpet loudly, invariably contracted their orbicular muscles. i can reconcile these conflicting statements only by supposing that the recently captured elephants in ceylon, from being enraged or frightened, desired to observe their persecutors, and consequently did not contract their orbicular muscles, so that their vision might not be impeded. those seen weeping by sir e. tennent were prostrate, and had given up the contest in despair. the elephants which trumpeted in the zoological gardens at the word of command, were, of course, neither alarmed nor enraged.] [footnote 621: bergeon, as quoted in the 'journal of anatomy and physiology,' nov. 1871, p. 235.] [footnote 622: see, for instance, a case given by sir charles bell, 'philosophical transactions,' 1823, p. 177.] [footnote 623: see, on these several points, prof. donders 'on the anomalies of accommodation and refraction of the eye,' 1864, p. 573.] [footnote 624: quoted by sir j. lubbock, 'prehistoric times,' 1865, p. 458.] [footnote 701: the above descriptive remarks are taken in part from my own observations, but chiefly from gratiolet ('de la physionomie,' pp. 53, 337;

both here standing in antagonism to the frontal muscle. i am unable to understand, judging from henle's drawings (woodcut, fig. 3), how the corrugator can act in the manner described by duchenne. see, also, on this subject, prof. donders' remarks in the 'archives of medicine,' 1870, vol. v. p. 34. mr. j. wood, who is so well known for his careful study of the muscles of the human frame, informs me that he believes the account which i have given of the action of the corrugator to be correct. but this is not a point of any importance with respect to the expression which is caused by the obliquity of the eyebrows, nor of much importance to the theory of its origin.] [footnote 704: i am greatly indebted to dr. duchenne for permission to have these two photographs (figs. 1 and 2) reproduced by the heliotype process from his work in folio. many of the foregoing remarks on the furrowing of the skin, when the eyebrows are rendered oblique, are taken from his excellent discussion on this subject.] [footnote 705: mecanisme de la phys. humaine, album, p. 15.] [footnote 706: henle, handbuch der anat. des menschen, 1858, b. i. s. 148, figs. 68 and 69.] [footnote 707: see the account of the action of this muscle by dr. duchenne, 'mecanisme de la physionomie humaine, album (1862), viii. p. 34.] [footnote 801: herbert spencer, 'essays scientific,' &c., 1858, p. 360.] [footnote 802: f. lieber on the vocal sounds of l. bridgman, 'smithsonian contributions,' 1851, vol. ii. p. 6.] [footnote 803: see, also, mr. marshall, in phil. transact. 1864, p. 526.] [footnote 804: mr. bain ('the emotions and the will,' 1865, p. 247) has a long and interesting discussion on the ludicrous. the quotation above given about the laughter of the gods is taken from this work. see, also, mandeville, 'the fable of the bees,' vol. ii. p. 168.] [footnote 805: 'the physiology of laughter,' essays, second series, 1863, p. 114.] [footnote 806: j. lister in 'quarterly journal of microscopical science,' 1853, vol. 1. p. 266.] [footnote 807: 'de la physionomie,' p. 186.] [footnote 808: sir c. bell (anat. of expression, p. 147) makes some remarks on the movement of the diaphragm during laughter.] [footnote 809: 'mecanisme de la physionomie humaine,' album, legende vi.] [footnote 810: handbuch der system. anat. des menschen, 1858, b. i. s. 144. see my woodcut (h. fig. 2).] [footnote 811: see, also, remarks to the same effect by dr. j. crichton browne in 'journal of mental science,' april, 1871, p. 149.] [footnote 812: c. vogt, 'memoire sur les microcephales,' 1867, p. 21.] [footnote 813: sir c. bell, 'anatomy of expression,' p. 133.] [footnote 814: 'mimik und physiognomik,' 1867, s. 63-67.] [footnote 815: sir t. reynolds remarks ('discourses,' xii. p. 100), "it is curious to observe, and it is certainly true, that the extremes of contrary passions are, with very little variation, expressed by the same action." he gives as an instance the frantic joy of a bacchante and the grief of a mary magdalen.] [footnote 816: dr. piderit has come to the same conclusion, ibid. s. 99.] [footnote 817: 'la physionomie,' par g. lavater, edit. of 1820, vol. iv. p. 224. see, also, sir c. bell, 'anatomy of expression,' p. 172, for the quotation given below.] [footnote 818: a 'dictionary of english etymology,' 2nd edit. 1872, introduction, p. xliv.] [footnote 819: crantz, quoted by tylor, 'primitive culture,' 1871, vol. i. p. 169.] [footnote 820: f. lieber, 'smithsonian contributions,' 1851, vol. ii. p. 7.] [footnote 821: mr. bain remarks ('mental and moral science,' 1868, p. 239), "tenderness is a pleasurable emotion, variously stimulated, whose effort is to draw human beings into mutual embrace."] [footnote 822: sir j. lubbock, 'prehistoric times,' 2nd edit. 1869, p. 552, gives full authorities for these statements. the quotation from steele is taken from this work.] [footnote 823: see a full acount,{sic} with references, by e. b. tylor, 'researches into the early history of mankind,' 2nd edit. 1870, p. 51.] [footnote 824: 'the descent of man,' vol. ii. p. 336.] [footnote 825: dr. mandsley has a discussion to this effect in his 'body and mind,' 1870, p. 85.] [footnote 826: 'the anatomy of expression,' p. 103, and 'philosophical transactions,' 1823, p. 182.] [footnote 827: 'the origin of language,' 1866, p. 146. mr. tylor ('early history of mankind,' 2nd edit. 1870, p. 48) gives a more complex origin to the position of the hands during prayer.] [footnote 901: 'anatomy of expression,' pp. 137, 139. it is not surprising that the corrugators should have become much more developed in man than in the anthropoid apes;

and this is effected partly by the corrugators. this movement would have been more especially serviceable to man, as soon as his early progenitors held their heads erect. lastly, prof. donders believes ('archives of medicine,' ed. by l. beale, 1870, vol. v. p. 34), that the corrugators are brought into action in causing the eyeball to advance in accommodation for proximity in vision.] [footnote 902: 'mecanisme de la physionomie humaine,' album, legende iii.] [footnote 903: 'mimik und physiognomik,' s. 46.] [footnote 904: 'history of the abipones,' eng. translat. vol. ii. p. 59, as quoted by lubbock, 'origin of civilisation,' 1870, p. 355.] [footnote 905: 'de la physionomie,' pp. 15, 144, 146. mr. herbert spencer accounts for frowning exclusively by the habit of contracting the brows as a shade to the eyes in a bright light: see 'principles of physiology,' 2nd edit. 1872, p. 546.] [footnote 906: gratiolet remarks (de la phys. p. 35), "quand l'attention est fixee sur quelque image interieure, l'oeil regarde dons le vide et s'associe automatiquement a la contemplation de l'esprit." but this view hardly deserves to be called an explanation.] [footnote 907: 'miles gloriosus,' act ii. sc. 2.] [footnote 908: the original photograph by herr kindermann is much more expressive than this copy, as it shows the frown on the brow more plainly.] [footnote 909: 'mecanisme de la physionomie humaine,' album, legende iv. figs. 16-18.] [footnote 910: hensleigh wedgwood on 'the origin of language,' 1866, p. 78.] [footnote 911: muller, as quoted by huxley, 'man's place in nature,' 1863, p. 38.] [footnote 912: i have given several instances in my 'descent of man,' vol. i. chap. iv.] [footnote 913: 'anatomy of expression.' p. 190.] [footnote 914: 'de la physionomie,' pp. 118-121.] [footnote 915: 'mimik und physiognomik,' s. 79.] [footnote 1001: see some remarks to this effect by mr. bain, 'the emotions and the will,' 2nd edit. 1865, p. 127.] [footnote 1002: rengger, naturgesch. der saugethiere von paraguay, 1830, s. 3.] [footnote 1003: sir c. bell, 'anatomy of expression,' p. 96. on the other hand, dr. burgess ('physiology of blushing,' 1839, p. 31) speaks of the reddening of a cicatrix in a negress as of the nature of a blush.] [footnote 1004: moreau and gratiolet have discussed the colour of the face under the influence of intense passion: see the edit. of 1820 of lavater, vol. iv. pp. 282 and 300;

and now that more time has elapsed, i have endeavoured to profit by the fiery ordeal through which the book has passed, and have taken advantage of all the criticisms which seem to me sound. i am also greatly indebted to a large number of correspondents for the communication of a surprising number of new facts and remarks. these have been so numerous, that i have been able to use only the more important ones; and of these, as well as of the more important corrections, i will append a list. some new illustrations have been introduced, and four of the old drawings have been replaced by better ones, done from life by mr. t.w. wood. i must especially call attention to some observations which i owe to the kindness of prof. huxley (given as a supplement at the end of part i.), on the nature of the differences between the brains of man and the higher apes. i have been particularly glad to give these observations, because during the last few years several memoirs on the subject have appeared on the continent, and their importance has been, in some cases, greatly exaggerated by popular writers. i may take this opportunity of remarking that my critics frequently assume that i attribute all changes of corporeal structure and mental power exclusively to the natural selection of such variations as are often called spontaneous; whereas, even in the first edition of the 'origin of species,' i distinctly stated that great weight must be attributed to the inherited effects of use and disuse, with respect both to the body and mind. i also attributed some amount of modification to the direct and prolonged action of changed conditions of life. some allowance, too, must be made for occasional reversions of structure; nor must we forget what i have called "correlated" growth, meaning, thereby, that various parts of the organisation are in some unknown manner so connected, that when one part varies, so do others; and if variations in the one are accumulated by selection, other parts will be modified. again, it has been said by several critics, that when i found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, i invented sexual selection; i gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'origin of species,' and i there stated that it was applicable to man. this subject of sexual selection has been treated at full length in the present work, simply because an opportunity was here first afforded me. i have been struck with the likeness of many of the half-favourable criticisms on sexual selection, with those which appeared at first on natural selection; such as, that it would explain some few details, but certainly was not applicable to the extent to which i have employed it. my conviction of the power of sexual selection remains unshaken; but it is probable, or almost certain, that several of my conclusions will hereafter be found erroneous; this can hardly fail to be the case in the first treatment of a subject. when naturalists have become familiar with the idea of sexual selection, it will, as i believe, be much more largely accepted; and it has already been fully and favourably received by several capable judges. down, beckenham, kent, september, 1874. first edition february 24, 1871. second edition september, 1874. contents. introduction. part i. the descent or origin of man. chapter i. the evidence of the descent of man from some lower form. nature of the evidence bearing on the origin of man--homologous structures in man and the lower animals--miscellaneous points of correspondence-- development--rudimentary structures, muscles, sense-organs, hair, bones, reproductive organs, etc.--the bearing of these three great classes of facts on the origin of man. chapter ii. on the manner of development of man from some lower form. variability of body and mind in man--inheritance--causes of variability-- laws of variation the same in man as in the lower animals--direct action of the conditions of life--effects of the increased use and disuse of parts-- arrested development--reversion--correlated variation--rate of increase-- checks to increase--natural selection--man the most dominant animal in the world--importance of his corporeal structure--the causes which have led to his becoming erect--consequent changes of structure--decrease in size of the canine teeth--increased size and altered shape of the skull--nakedness --absence of a tail--defenceless condition of man. chapter iii. comparison of the mental powers of man and the lower animals. the difference in mental power between the highest ape and the lowest savage, immense--certain instincts in common--the emotions--curiosity-- imitation--attention--memory--imagination--reason--progressive improvement --tools and weapons used by animals--abstraction, self-consciousness-- language--sense of beauty--belief in god, spiritual agencies, superstitions. chapter iv. comparison of the mental powers of man and the lower animals--continued. the moral sense--fundamental proposition--the qualities of social animals-- origin of sociability--struggle between opposed instincts--man a social animal--the more enduring social instincts conquer other less persistent instincts--the social virtues alone regarded by savages--the self-regarding virtues acquired at a later stage of development--the importance of the judgment of the members of the same community on conduct--transmission of moral tendencies--summary. chapter v. on the development of the intellectual and moral faculties during primeval and civilised times. advancement of the intellectual powers through natural selection-- importance of imitation--social and moral faculties--their development within the limits of the same tribe--natural selection as affecting civilised nations--evidence that civilised nations were once barbarous. chapter vi. on the affinities and genealogy of man. position of man in the animal series--the natural system genealogical-- adaptive characters of slight value--various small points of resemblance between man and the quadrumana--rank of man in the natural system-- birthplace and antiquity of man--absence of fossil connecting-links--lower stages in the genealogy of man, as inferred firstly from his affinities and secondly from his structure--early androgynous condition of the vertebrata --conclusion. chapter vii. on the races of man. the nature and value of specific characters--application to the races of man--arguments in favour of, and opposed to, ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species--sub-species--monogenists and polygenists-- convergence of character--numerous points of resemblance in body and mind between the most distinct races of man--the state of man when he first spread over the earth--each race not descended from a single pair--the extinction of races--the formation of races--the effects of crossing-- slight influence of the direct action of the conditions of life--slight or no influence of natural selection--sexual selection. part ii. sexual selection. chapter viii. principles of sexual selection. secondary sexual characters--sexual selection--manner of action--excess of males--polygamy--the male alone generally modified through sexual selection--eagerness of the male--variability of the male--choice exerted by the female--sexual compared with natural selection--inheritance at corresponding periods of life, at corresponding seasons of the year, and as limited by sex--relations between the several forms of inheritance--causes why one sex and the young are not modified through sexual selection-- supplement on the proportional numbers of the two sexes throughout the animal kingdom-- the proportion of the sexes in relation to natural selection. chapter ix. secondary sexual characters in the lower classes of the animal kingdom. these characters are absent in the lowest classes--brilliant colours-- mollusca--annelids--crustacea, secondary sexual characters strongly developed;

and this especially holds good with the younger and rising naturalists. the greater number accept the agency of natural selection; though some urge, whether with justice the future must decide, that i have greatly overrated its importance. of the older and honoured chiefs in natural science, many unfortunately are still opposed to evolution in every form. in consequence of the views now adopted by most naturalists, and which will ultimately, as in every other case, be followed by others who are not scientific, i have been led to put together my notes, so as to see how far the general conclusions arrived at in my former works were applicable to man. this seemed all the more desirable, as i had never deliberately applied these views to a species taken singly. when we confine our attention to any one form, we are deprived of the weighty arguments derived from the nature of the affinities which connect together whole groups of organisms--their geographical distribution in past and present times, and their geological succession. the homological structure, embryological development, and rudimentary organs of a species remain to be considered, whether it be man or any other animal, to which our attention may be directed; but these great classes of facts afford, as it appears to me, ample and conclusive evidence in favour of the principle of gradual evolution. the strong support derived from the other arguments should, however, always be kept before the mind. the sole object of this work is to consider, firstly, whether man, like every other species, is descended from some pre-existing form; secondly, the manner of his development; and thirdly, the value of the differences between the so-called races of man. as i shall confine myself to these points, it will not be necessary to describe in detail the differences between the several races--an enormous subject which has been fully described in many valuable works. the high antiquity of man has recently been demonstrated by the labours of a host of eminent men, beginning with m. boucher de perthes; and this is the indispensable basis for understanding his origin. i shall, therefore, take this conclusion for granted, and may refer my readers to the admirable treatises of sir charles lyell, sir john lubbock, and others. nor shall i have occasion to do more than to allude to the amount of difference between man and the anthropomorphous apes; for prof. huxley, in the opinion of most competent judges, has conclusively shewn that in every visible character man differs less from the higher apes, than these do from the lower members of the same order of primates. this work contains hardly any original facts in regard to man; but as the conclusions at which i arrived, after drawing up a rough draft, appeared to me interesting, i thought that they might interest others. it has often and confidently been asserted, that man's origin can never be known: but ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science. the conclusion that man is the co-descendant with other species of some ancient, lower, and extinct form, is not in any degree new. lamarck long ago came to this conclusion, which has lately been maintained by several eminent naturalists and philosophers; for instance, by wallace, huxley, lyell, vogt, lubbock, buchner, rolle, etc. (1. as the works of the first- named authors are so well known, i need not give the titles; but as those of the latter are less well known in england, i will give them:--'sechs vorlesungen über die darwin'sche theorie:' zweite auflage, 1868, von dr l. buchner; translated into french under the title 'conférences sur la théorie darwinienne,' 1869. 'der mensch im lichte der darwin'sche lehre,' 1865, von dr. f. rolle. i will not attempt to give references to all the authors who have taken the same side of the question. thus g. canestrini has published ('annuario della soc. d. nat.,' modena, 1867, page 81) a very curious paper on rudimentary characters, as bearing on the origin of man. another work has (1869) been published by dr. francesco barrago, bearing in italian the title of "man, made in the image of god, was also made in the image of the ape."), and especially by haeckel. this last naturalist, besides his great work, 'generelle morphologie' (1866), has recently (1868, with a second edition in 1870), published his 'natürliche schöpfungsgeschichte,' in which he fully discusses the genealogy of man. if this work had appeared before my essay had been written, i should probably never have completed it. almost all the conclusions at which i have arrived i find confirmed by this naturalist, whose knowledge on many points is much fuller than mine. wherever i have added any fact or view from prof. haeckel's writings, i give his authority in the text; other statements i leave as they originally stood in my manuscript, occasionally giving in the foot-notes references to his works, as a confirmation of the more doubtful or interesting points. during many years it has seemed to me highly probable that sexual selection has played an important part in differentiating the races of man; but in my 'origin of species' (first edition, page 199) i contented myself by merely alluding to this belief. when i came to apply this view to man, i found it indispensable to treat the whole subject in full detail. (2. prof. haeckel was the only author who, at the time when this work first appeared, had discussed the subject of sexual selection, and had seen its full importance, since the publication of the 'origin'; and this he did in a very able manner in his various works.) consequently the second part of the present work, treating of sexual selection, has extended to an inordinate length, compared with the first part; but this could not be avoided. i had intended adding to the present volumes an essay on the expression of the various emotions by man and the lower animals. my attention was called to this subject many years ago by sir charles bell's admirable work. this illustrious anatomist maintains that man is endowed with certain muscles solely for the sake of expressing his emotions. as this view is obviously opposed to the belief that man is descended from some other and lower form, it was necessary for me to consider it. i likewise wished to ascertain how far the emotions are expressed in the same manner by the different races of man. but owing to the length of the present work, i have thought it better to reserve my essay for separate publication. part i. the descent or origin of man. chapter i. the evidence of the descent of man from some lower form. nature of the evidence bearing on the origin of man--homologous structures in man and the lower animals--miscellaneous points of correspondence-- development--rudimentary structures, muscles, sense-organs, hair, bones, reproductive organs, etc.--the bearing of these three great classes of facts on the origin of man. he who wishes to decide whether man is the modified descendant of some pre- existing form, would probably first enquire whether man varies, however slightly, in bodily structure and in mental faculties; and if so, whether the variations are transmitted to his offspring in accordance with the laws which prevail with the lower animals. again, are the variations the result, as far as our ignorance permits us to judge, of the same general causes, and are they governed by the same general laws, as in the case of other organisms; for instance, by correlation, the inherited effects of use and disuse, etc.? is man subject to similar malconformations, the result of arrested development, of reduplication of parts, etc., and does he display in any of his anomalies reversion to some former and ancient type of structure? it might also naturally be enquired whether man, like so many other animals, has given rise to varieties and sub-races, differing but slightly from each other, or to races differing so much that they must be classed as doubtful species? how are such races distributed over the world; and how, when crossed, do they react on each other in the first and succeeding generations? and so with many other points. the enquirer would next come to the important point, whether man tends to increase at so rapid a rate, as to lead to occasional severe struggles for existence; and consequently to beneficial variations, whether in body or mind, being preserved, and injurious ones eliminated. do the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace one another, so that some finally become extinct? we shall see that all these questions, as indeed is obvious in respect to most of them, must be answered in the affirmative, in the same manner as with the lower animals. but the several considerations just referred to may be conveniently deferred for a time: and we will first see how far the bodily structure of man shews traces, more or less plain, of his descent from some lower form. in succeeding chapters the mental powers of man, in comparison with those of the lower animals, will be considered. the bodily structure of man. it is notorious that man is constructed on the same general type or model as other mammals. all the bones in his skeleton can be compared with corresponding bones in a monkey, bat, or seal. so it is with his muscles, nerves, blood-vessels and internal viscera. the brain, the most important of all the organs, follows the same law, as shewn by huxley and other anatomists. bischoff (1. 'grosshirnwindungen des menschen,' 1868, s. 96. the conclusions of this author, as well as those of gratiolet and aeby, concerning the brain, will be discussed by prof. huxley in the appendix alluded to in the preface to this edition.), who is a hostile witness, admits that every chief fissure and fold in the brain of man has its analogy in that of the orang; but he adds that at no period of development do their brains perfectly agree; nor could perfect agreement be expected, for otherwise their mental powers would have been the same. vulpian (2. 'lec. sur la phys.' 1866, page 890, as quoted by m. dally, 'l'ordre des primates et le transformisme,' 1868, page 29.), remarks: "les différences réelles qui existent entre l'encephale de l'homme et celui des singes supérieurs, sont bien minimes. il ne faut pas se faire d'illusions a cet égard. l'homme est bien plus près des singes anthropomorphes par les caractères anatomiques de son cerveau que ceux-ci ne le sont non seulement des autres mammifères, mais même de certains quadrumanes, des guenons et des macaques." but it would be superfluous here to give further details on the correspondence between man and the higher mammals in the structure of the brain and all other parts of the body. it may, however, be worth while to specify a few points, not directly or obviously connected with structure, by which this correspondence or relationship is well shewn. man is liable to receive from the lower animals, and to communicate to them, certain diseases, as hydrophobia, variola, the glanders, syphilis, cholera, herpes, etc. (3. dr. w. lauder lindsay has treated this subject at some length in the 'journal of mental science,' july 1871; and in the 'edinburgh veterinary review,' july 1858.); and this fact proves the close similarity (4. a reviewer has criticised ('british quarterly review,' oct. 1st, 1871, page 472) what i have here said with much severity and contempt; but as i do not use the term identity, i cannot see that i am greatly in error. there appears to me a strong analogy between the same infection or contagion producing the same result, or one closely similar, in two distinct animals, and the testing of two distinct fluids by the same chemical reagent.) of their tissues and blood, both in minute structure and composition, far more plainly than does their comparison under the best microscope, or by the aid of the best chemical analysis. monkeys are liable to many of the same non-contagious diseases as we are; thus rengger (5. 'naturgeschichte der säugethiere von paraguay,' 1830, s. 50.), who carefully observed for a long time the cebus azarae in its native land, found it liable to catarrh, with the usual symptoms, and which, when often recurrent, led to consumption. these monkeys suffered also from apoplexy, inflammation of the bowels, and cataract in the eye. the younger ones when shedding their milk-teeth often died from fever. medicines produced the same effect on them as on us. many kinds of monkeys have a strong taste for tea, coffee, and spiritous liquors: they will also, as i have myself seen, smoke tobacco with pleasure. (6. the same tastes are common to some animals much lower in the scale. mr. a. nichols informs me that he kept in queensland, in australia, three individuals of the phaseolarctus cinereus; and that, without having been taught in any way, they acquired a strong taste for rum, and for smoking tobacco.) brehm asserts that the natives of north-eastern africa catch the wild baboons by exposing vessels with strong beer, by which they are made drunk. he has seen some of these animals, which he kept in confinement, in this state; and he gives a laughable account of their behaviour and strange grimaces. on the following morning they were very cross and dismal; they held their aching heads with both hands, and wore a most pitiable expression: when beer or wine was offered them, they turned away with disgust, but relished the juice of lemons. (7. brehm, 'thierleben,' b. i. 1864, s. 75, 86. on the ateles, s. 105. for other analogous statements, see s. 25, 107.) an american monkey, an ateles, after getting drunk on brandy, would never touch it again, and thus was wiser than many men. these trifling facts prove how similar the nerves of taste must be in monkeys and man, and how similarly their whole nervous system is affected. man is infested with internal parasites, sometimes causing fatal effects; and is plagued by external parasites, all of which belong to the same genera or families as those infesting other mammals, and in the case of scabies to the same species. (8. dr. w. lauder lindsay, 'edinburgh vet. review,' july 1858, page 13.) man is subject, like other mammals, birds, and even insects (9. with respect to insects see dr. laycock, "on a general law of vital periodicity," 'british association,' 1842. dr. macculloch, 'silliman's north american journal of science,' vol. xvii. page 305, has seen a dog suffering from tertian ague. hereafter i shall return to this subject.), to that mysterious law, which causes certain normal processes, such as gestation, as well as the maturation and duration of various diseases, to follow lunar periods. his wounds are repaired by the same process of healing; and the stumps left after the amputation of his limbs, especially during an early embryonic period, occasionally possess some power of regeneration, as in the lowest animals. (10. i have given the evidence on this head in my 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. page 15, and more could be added.) the whole process of that most important function, the reproduction of the species, is strikingly the same in all mammals, from the first act of courtship by the male (11. mares e diversis generibus quadrumanorum sine dubio dignoscunt feminas humanas a maribus. primum, credo, odoratu, postea aspectu. mr. youatt, qui diu in hortis zoologicis (bestiariis) medicus animalium erat, vir in rebus observandis cautus et sagax, hoc mihi certissime probavit, et curatores ejusdem loci et alii e ministris confirmaverunt. sir andrew smith et brehm notabant idem in cynocephalo. illustrissimus cuvier etiam narrat multa de hac re, qua ut opinor, nihil turpius potest indicari inter omnia hominibus et quadrumanis communia. narrat enim cynocephalum quendam in furorem incidere aspectu feminarum aliquarem, sed nequaquam accendi tanto furore ab omnibus. semper eligebat juniores, et dignoscebat in turba, et advocabat voce gestuque.), to the birth and nurturing of the young. monkeys are born in almost as helpless a condition as our own infants; and in certain genera the young differ fully as much in appearance from the adults, as do our children from their full-grown parents. (12. this remark is made with respect to cynocephalus and the anthropomorphous apes by geoffroy saint-hilaire and f. cuvier, 'histoire nat. des mammifères,' tom. i. 1824.) it has been urged by some writers, as an important distinction, that with man the young arrive at maturity at a much later age than with any other animal: but if we look to the races of mankind which inhabit tropical countries the difference is not great, for the orang is believed not to be adult till the age of from ten to fifteen years. (13. huxley, 'man's place in nature,' 1863, p. 34.) man differs from woman in size, bodily strength, hairiness, etc., as well as in mind, in the same manner as do the two sexes of many mammals. so that the correspondence in general structure, in the minute structure of the tissues, in chemical composition and in constitution, between man and the higher animals, especially the anthropomorphous apes, is extremely close. embryonic development. [fig. 1. shows a human embryo, from ecker, and a dog embryo, from bischoff. labelled in each are: a. fore-brain, cerebral hemispheres, etc. b. mid-brain, corpora quadrigemina. c. hind-brain, cerebellum, medulla oblongata. d. eye. e. ear. f. first visceral arch. g. second visceral arch. h. vertebral columns and muscles in process of development. i. anterior extremities. k. posterior extremities. l. tail or os coccyx.] man is developed from an ovule, about the 125th of an inch in diameter, which differs in no respect from the ovules of other animals. the embryo itself at a very early period can hardly be distinguished from that of other members of the vertebrate kingdom. at this period the arteries run in arch-like branches, as if to carry the blood to branchiae which are not present in the higher vertebrata, though the slits on the sides of the neck still remain (see f, g, fig. 1), marking their former position. at a somewhat later period, when the extremities are developed, "the feet of lizards and mammals," as the illustrious von baer remarks, "the wings and feet of birds, no less than the hands and feet of man, all arise from the same fundamental form." it is, says prof. huxley (14. 'man's place in nature,' 1863, p. 67.), "quite in the later stages of development that the young human being presents marked differences from the young ape, while the latter departs as much from the dog in its developments, as the man does. startling as this last assertion may appear to be, it is demonstrably true." as some of my readers may never have seen a drawing of an embryo, i have given one of man and another of a dog, at about the same early stage of development, carefully copied from two works of undoubted accuracy. (15. the human embryo (upper fig.) is from ecker, 'icones phys.,' 1851-1859, tab. xxx. fig. 2. this embryo was ten lines in length, so that the drawing is much magnified. the embryo of the dog is from bischoff, 'entwicklungsgeschichte des hunde-eies,' 1845, tab. xi. fig. 42b. this drawing is five times magnified, the embryo being twenty-five days old. the internal viscera have been omitted, and the uterine appendages in both drawings removed. i was directed to these figures by prof. huxley, from whose work, 'man's place in nature,' the idea of giving them was taken. haeckel has also given analogous drawings in his 'schopfungsgeschichte.') after the foregoing statements made by such high authorities, it would be superfluous on my part to give a number of borrowed details, shewing that the embryo of man closely resembles that of other mammals. it may, however, be added, that the human embryo likewise resembles certain low forms when adult in various points of structure. for instance, the heart at first exists as a simple pulsating vessel; the excreta are voided through a cloacal passage; and the os coccyx projects like a true tail, "extending considerably beyond the rudimentary legs." (16. prof. wyman in 'proceedings of the american academy of sciences,' vol. iv. 1860, p. 17.) in the embryos of all air-breathing vertebrates, certain glands, called the corpora wolffiana, correspond with, and act like the kidneys of mature fishes. (17. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. i. p. 533.) even at a later embryonic period, some striking resemblances between man and the lower animals may be observed. bischoff says that "the convolutions of the brain in a human foetus at the end of the seventh month reach about the same stage of development as in a baboon when adult." (18. 'die grosshirnwindungen des menschen,' 1868, s. 95.) the great toe, as professor owen remarks (19. 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. ii. p. 553.), "which forms the fulcrum when standing or walking, is perhaps the most characteristic peculiarity in the human structure;" but in an embryo, about an inch in length, prof. wyman (20. 'proc. soc. nat. hist.' boston, 1863, vol. ix. p. 185.) found "that the great toe was shorter than the others; and, instead of being parallel to them, projected at an angle from the side of the foot, thus corresponding with the permanent condition of this part in the quadrumana." i will conclude with a quotation from huxley (21. 'man's place in nature,' p. 65.) who after asking, does man originate in a different way from a dog, bird, frog or fish? says, "the reply is not doubtful for a moment; without question, the mode of origin, and the early stages of the development of man, are identical with those of the animals immediately below him in the scale: without a doubt in these respects, he is far nearer to apes than the apes are to the dog." rudiments. this subject, though not intrinsically more important than the two last, will for several reasons be treated here more fully. (22. i had written a rough copy of this chapter before reading a valuable paper, "caratteri rudimentali in ordine all' origine dell' uomo" ('annuario della soc. d. naturalisti,' modena, 1867, p. 81), by g. canestrini, to which paper i am considerably indebted. haeckel has given admirable discussions on this whole subject, under the title of dysteleology, in his 'generelle morphologie' and 'schöpfungsgeschichte.') not one of the higher animals can be named which does not bear some part in a rudimentary condition; and man forms no exception to the rule. rudimentary organs must be distinguished from those that are nascent; though in some cases the distinction is not easy. the former are either absolutely useless, such as the mammae of male quadrupeds, or the incisor teeth of ruminants which never cut through the gums; or they are of such slight service to their present possessors, that we can hardly suppose that they were developed under the conditions which now exist. organs in this latter state are not strictly rudimentary, but they are tending in this direction. nascent organs, on the other hand, though not fully developed, are of high service to their possessors, and are capable of further development. rudimentary organs are eminently variable; and this is partly intelligible, as they are useless, or nearly useless, and consequently are no longer subjected to natural selection. they often become wholly suppressed. when this occurs, they are nevertheless liable to occasional reappearance through reversion-- a circumstance well worthy of attention. the chief agents in causing organs to become rudimentary seem to have been disuse at that period of life when the organ is chiefly used (and this is generally during maturity), and also inheritance at a corresponding period of life. the term "disuse" does not relate merely to the lessened action of muscles, but includes a diminished flow of blood to a part or organ, from being subjected to fewer alternations of pressure, or from becoming in any way less habitually active. rudiments, however, may occur in one sex of those parts which are normally present in the other sex; and such rudiments, as we shall hereafter see, have often originated in a way distinct from those here referred to. in some cases, organs have been reduced by means of natural selection, from having become injurious to the species under changed habits of life. the process of reduction is probably often aided through the two principles of compensation and economy of growth; but the later stages of reduction, after disuse has done all that can fairly be attributed to it, and when the saving to be effected by the economy of growth would be very small (23. some good criticisms on this subject have been given by messrs. murie and mivart, in 'transact. zoological society,' 1869, vol. vii. p. 92.), are difficult to understand. the final and complete suppression of a part, already useless and much reduced in size, in which case neither compensation nor economy can come into play, is perhaps intelligible by the aid of the hypothesis of pangenesis. but as the whole subject of rudimentary organs has been discussed and illustrated in my former works (24. 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii pp. 317 and 397. see also 'origin of species,' 5th edition p. 535.), i need here say no more on this head. rudiments of various muscles have been observed in many parts of the human body (25. for instance, m. richard ('annales des sciences nat.,' 3rd series, zoolog. 1852, tom. xviii. p. 13) describes and figures rudiments of what he calls the "muscle pedieux de la main," which he says is sometimes "infiniment petit." another muscle, called "le tibial posterieur," is generally quite absent in the hand, but appears from time to time in a more or less rudimentary condition.); and not a few muscles, which are regularly present in some of the lower animals can occasionally be detected in man in a greatly reduced condition. every one must have noticed the power which many animals, especially horses, possess of moving or twitching their skin; and this is effected by the panniculus carnosus. remnants of this muscle in an efficient state are found in various parts of our bodies; for instance, the muscle on the forehead, by which the eyebrows are raised. the platysma myoides, which is well developed on the neck, belongs to this system. prof. turner, of edinburgh, has occasionally detected, as he informs me, muscular fasciculi in five different situations, namely in the axillae, near the scapulae, etc., all of which must be referred to the system of the panniculus. he has also shewn (26. prof. w. turner, 'proceedings of the royal society of edinburgh,' 1866-67, p. 65.) that the musculus sternalis or sternalis brutorum, which is not an extension of the rectus abdominalis, but is closely allied to the panniculus, occurred in the proportion of about three per cent. in upwards of 600 bodies: he adds, that this muscle affords "an excellent illustration of the statement that occasional and rudimentary structures are especially liable to variation in arrangement." some few persons have the power of contracting the superficial muscles on their scalps; and these muscles are in a variable and partially rudimentary condition. m. a. de candolle has communicated to me a curious instance of the long-continued persistence or inheritance of this power, as well as of its unusual development. he knows a family, in which one member, the present head of the family, could, when a youth, pitch several heavy books from his head by the movement of the scalp alone; and he won wagers by performing this feat. his father, uncle, grandfather, and his three children possess the same power to the same unusual degree. this family became divided eight generations ago into two branches; so that the head of the above-mentioned branch is cousin in the seventh degree to the head of the other branch. this distant cousin resides in another part of france; and on being asked whether he possessed the same faculty, immediately exhibited his power. this case offers a good illustration how persistent may be the transmission of an absolutely useless faculty, probably derived from our remote semi-human progenitors; since many monkeys have, and frequently use the power, of largely moving their scalps up and down. (27. see my 'expression of the emotions in man and animals,' 1872, p. 144.) the extrinsic muscles which serve to move the external ear, and the intrinsic muscles which move the different parts, are in a rudimentary condition in man, and they all belong to the system of the panniculus; they are also variable in development, or at least in function. i have seen one man who could draw the whole ear forwards; other men can draw it upwards; another who could draw it backwards (28. canestrini quotes hyrtl. ('annuario della soc. dei naturalisti,' modena, 1867, p. 97) to the same effect.); and from what one of these persons told me, it is probable that most of us, by often touching our ears, and thus directing our attention towards them, could recover some power of movement by repeated trials. the power of erecting and directing the shell of the ears to the various points of the compass, is no doubt of the highest service to many animals, as they thus perceive the direction of danger; but i have never heard, on sufficient evidence, of a man who possessed this power, the one which might be of use to him. the whole external shell may be considered a rudiment, together with the various folds and prominences (helix and anti-helix, tragus and anti-tragus, etc.) which in the lower animals strengthen and support the ear when erect, without adding much to its weight. some authors, however, suppose that the cartilage of the shell serves to transmit vibrations to the acoustic nerve; but mr. toynbee (29. 'the diseases of the ear,' by j. toynbee, f.r.s., 1860, p. 12. a distinguished physiologist, prof. preyer, informs me that he had lately been experimenting on the function of the shell of the ear, and has come to nearly the same conclusion as that given here.), after collecting all the known evidence on this head, concludes that the external shell is of no distinct use. the ears of the chimpanzee and orang are curiously like those of man, and the proper muscles are likewise but very slightly developed. (30. prof. a. macalister, 'annals and magazine of natural history,' vol. vii. 1871, p. 342.) i am also assured by the keepers in the zoological gardens that these animals never move or erect their ears; so that they are in an equally rudimentary condition with those of man, as far as function is concerned. why these animals, as well as the progenitors of man, should have lost the power of erecting their ears, we cannot say. it may be, though i am not satisfied with this view, that owing to their arboreal habits and great strength they were but little exposed to danger, and so during a lengthened period moved their ears but little, and thus gradually lost the power of moving them. this would be a parallel case with that of those large and heavy birds, which, from inhabiting oceanic islands, have not been exposed to the attacks of beasts of prey, and have consequently lost the power of using their wings for flight. the inability to move the ears in man and several apes is, however, partly compensated by the freedom with which they can move the head in a horizontal plane, so as to catch sounds from all directions. it has been asserted that the ear of man alone possesses a lobule; but "a rudiment of it is found in the gorilla" (31. mr. st. george mivart, 'elementary anatomy,' 1873, p. 396.); and, as i hear from prof. preyer, it is not rarely absent in the negro. [fig. 2. human ear, modelled and drawn by mr. woolner. the projecting point is labelled a.] the celebrated sculptor, mr. woolner, informs me of one little peculiarity in the external ear, which he has often observed both in men and women, and of which he perceived the full significance. his attention was first called to the subject whilst at work on his figure of puck, to which he had given pointed ears. he was thus led to examine the ears of various monkeys, and subsequently more carefully those of man. the peculiarity consists in a little blunt point, projecting from the inwardly folded margin, or helix. when present, it is developed at birth, and, according to prof. ludwig meyer, more frequently in man than in woman. mr. woolner made an exact model of one such case, and sent me the accompanying drawing. (fig. 2). these points not only project inwards towards the centre of the ear, but often a little outwards from its plane, so as to be visible when the head is viewed from directly in front or behind. they are variable in size, and somewhat in position, standing either a little higher or lower; and they sometimes occur on one ear and not on the other. they are not confined to mankind, for i observed a case in one of the spider-monkeys (ateles beelzebuth) in our zoological gardens; and mr. e. ray lankester informs me of another case in a chimpanzee in the gardens at hamburg. the helix obviously consists of the extreme margin of the ear folded inwards; and this folding appears to be in some manner connected with the whole external ear being permanently pressed backwards. in many monkeys, which do not stand high in the order, as baboons and some species of macacus (32. see also some remarks, and the drawings of the ears of the lemuroidea, in messrs. murie and mivart's excellent paper in 'transactions of the zoological society,' vol. vii. 1869, pp. 6 and 90.), the upper portion of the ear is slightly pointed, and the margin is not at all folded inwards; but if the margin were to be thus folded, a slight point would necessarily project inwards towards the centre, and probably a little outwards from the plane of the ear; and this i believe to be their origin in many cases. on the other hand, prof. l. meyer, in an able paper recently published (33. 'über das darwin'sche spitzohr,' archiv fur path. anat. und phys., 1871, p. 485.), maintains that the whole case is one of mere variability; and that the projections are not real ones, but are due to the internal cartilage on each side of the points not having been fully developed. i am quite ready to admit that this is the correct explanation in many instances, as in those figured by prof. meyer, in which there are several minute points, or the whole margin is sinuous. i have myself seen, through the kindness of dr. l. down, the ear of a microcephalous idiot, on which there is a projection on the outside of the helix, and not on the inward folded edge, so that this point can have no relation to a former apex of the ear. nevertheless in some cases, my original view, that the points are vestiges of the tips of formerly erect and pointed ears, still seems to me probable. i think so from the frequency of their occurrence, and from the general correspondence in position with that of the tip of a pointed ear. in one case, of which a photograph has been sent me, the projection is so large, that supposing, in accordance with prof. meyer's view, the ear to be made perfect by the equal development of the cartilage throughout the whole extent of the margin, it would have covered fully one-third of the whole ear. two cases have been communicated to me, one in north america, and the other in england, in which the upper margin is not at all folded inwards, but is pointed, so that it closely resembles the pointed ear of an ordinary quadruped in outline. in one of these cases, which was that of a young child, the father compared the ear with the drawing which i have given (34. 'the expression of the emotions,' p. 136.) of the ear of a monkey, the cynopithecus niger, and says that their outlines are closely similar. if, in these two cases, the margin had been folded inwards in the normal manner, an inward projection must have been formed. i may add that in two other cases the outline still remains somewhat pointed, although the margin of the upper part of the ear is normally folded inwards--in one of them, however, very narrowly. [fig.3. foetus of an orang(?). exact copy of a photograph, shewing the form of the ear at this early age.] the following woodcut (no. 3) is an accurate copy of a photograph of the foetus of an orang (kindly sent me by dr. nitsche), in which it may be seen how different the pointed outline of the ear is at this period from its adult condition, when it bears a close general resemblance to that of man. it is evident that the folding over of the tip of such an ear, unless it changed greatly during its further development, would give rise to a point projecting inwards. on the whole, it still seems to me probable that the points in question are in some cases, both in man and apes, vestiges of a former condition. the nictitating membrane, or third eyelid, with its accessory muscles and other structures, is especially well developed in birds, and is of much functional importance to them, as it can be rapidly drawn across the whole eye-ball. it is found in some reptiles and amphibians, and in certain fishes, as in sharks. it is fairly well developed in the two lower divisions of the mammalian series, namely, in the monotremata and marsupials, and in some few of the higher mammals, as in the walrus. but in man, the quadrumana, and most other mammals, it exists, as is admitted by all anatomists, as a mere rudiment, called the semilunar fold. (35. muller's 'elements of physiology,' eng. translat. 1842, vol. ii. p. 1117. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 260; ibid. on the walrus, 'proceedings of the zoological society,' november 8, 1854. see also r. knox, 'great artists and anatomists,' p. 106. this rudiment apparently is somewhat larger in negroes and australians than in europeans, see carl vogt, 'lectures on man,' eng. translat. p. 129.) the sense of smell is of the highest importance to the greater number of mammals--to some, as the ruminants, in warning them of danger; to others, as the carnivora, in finding their prey; to others, again, as the wild boar, for both purposes combined. but the sense of smell is of extremely slight service, if any, even to the dark coloured races of men, in whom it is much more highly developed than in the white and civilised races. (36. the account given by humboldt of the power of smell possessed by the natives of south america is well known, and has been confirmed by others. m. houzeau ('études sur les facultés mentales,' etc., tom. i. 1872, p. 91) asserts that he repeatedly made experiments, and proved that negroes and indians could recognise persons in the dark by their odour. dr. w. ogle has made some curious observations on the connection between the power of smell and the colouring matter of the mucous membrane of the olfactory region as well as of the skin of the body. i have, therefore, spoken in the text of the dark-coloured races having a finer sense of smell than the white races. see his paper, 'medico-chirurgical transactions,' london, vol. liii. 1870, p. 276.) nevertheless it does not warn them of danger, nor guide them to their food; nor does it prevent the esquimaux from sleeping in the most fetid atmosphere, nor many savages from eating half-putrid meat. in europeans the power differs greatly in different individuals, as i am assured by an eminent naturalist who possesses this sense highly developed, and who has attended to the subject. those who believe in the principle of gradual evolution, will not readily admit that the sense of smell in its present state was originally acquired by man, as he now exists. he inherits the power in an enfeebled and so far rudimentary condition, from some early progenitor, to whom it was highly serviceable, and by whom it was continually used. in those animals which have this sense highly developed, such as dogs and horses, the recollection of persons and of places is strongly associated with their odour; and we can thus perhaps understand how it is, as dr. maudsley has truly remarked (37. 'the physiology and pathology of mind,' 2nd ed. 1868, p. 134.), that the sense of smell in man "is singularly effective in recalling vividly the ideas and images of forgotten scenes and places." man differs conspicuously from all the other primates in being almost naked. but a few short straggling hairs are found over the greater part of the body in the man, and fine down on that of the woman. the different races differ much in hairiness; and in the individuals of the same race the hairs are highly variable, not only in abundance, but likewise in position: thus in some europeans the shoulders are quite naked, whilst in others they bear thick tufts of hair. (38. eschricht, über die richtung der haare am menschlichen körper, muller's 'archiv fur anat. und phys.' 1837, s. 47. i shall often have to refer to this very curious paper.) there can be little doubt that the hairs thus scattered over the body are the rudiments of the uniform hairy coat of the lower animals. this view is rendered all the more probable, as it is known that fine, short, and pale-coloured hairs on the limbs and other parts of the body, occasionally become developed into "thickset, long, and rather coarse dark hairs," when abnormally nourished near old-standing inflamed surfaces. (39. paget, 'lectures on surgical pathology,' 1853, vol. i. p. 71.) i am informed by sir james paget that often several members of a family have a few hairs in their eyebrows much longer than the others; so that even this slight peculiarity seems to be inherited. these hairs, too, seem to have their representatives; for in the chimpanzee, and in certain species of macacus, there are scattered hairs of considerable length rising from the naked skin above the eyes, and corresponding to our eyebrows; similar long hairs project from the hairy covering of the superciliary ridges in some baboons. the fine wool-like hair, or so-called lanugo, with which the human foetus during the sixth month is thickly covered, offers a more curious case. it is first developed, during the fifth month, on the eyebrows and face, and especially round the mouth, where it is much longer than that on the head. a moustache of this kind was observed by eschricht (40. eschricht, ibid. s. 40, 47.) on a female foetus; but this is not so surprising a circumstance as it may at first appear, for the two sexes generally resemble each other in all external characters during an early period of growth. the direction and arrangement of the hairs on all parts of the foetal body are the same as in the adult, but are subject to much variability. the whole surface, including even the forehead and ears, is thus thickly clothed; but it is a significant fact that the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet are quite naked, like the inferior surfaces of all four extremities in most of the lower animals. as this can hardly be an accidental coincidence, the woolly covering of the foetus probably represents the first permanent coat of hair in those mammals which are born hairy. three or four cases have been recorded of persons born with their whole bodies and faces thickly covered with fine long hairs; and this strange condition is strongly inherited, and is correlated with an abnormal condition of the teeth. (41. see my 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. p. 327. prof. alex. brandt has recently sent me an additional case of a father and son, born in russia, with these peculiarities. i have received drawings of both from paris.) prof. alex. brandt informs me that he has compared the hair from the face of a man thus characterised, aged thirty-five, with the lanugo of a foetus, and finds it quite similar in texture; therefore, as he remarks, the case may be attributed to an arrest of development in the hair, together with its continued growth. many delicate children, as i have been assured by a surgeon to a hospital for children, have their backs covered by rather long silky hairs; and such cases probably come under the same head. it appears as if the posterior molar or wisdom-teeth were tending to become rudimentary in the more civilised races of man. these teeth are rather smaller than the other molars, as is likewise the case with the corresponding teeth in the chimpanzee and orang; and they have only two separate fangs. they do not cut through the gums till about the seventeenth year, and i have been assured that they are much more liable to decay, and are earlier lost than the other teeth; but this is denied by some eminent dentists. they are also much more liable to vary, both in structure and in the period of their development, than the other teeth. (42. dr. webb, 'teeth in man and the anthropoid apes,' as quoted by dr. c. carter blake in anthropological review, july 1867, p. 299.) in the melanian races, on the other hand, the wisdom-teeth are usually furnished with three separate fangs, and are generally sound; they also differ from the other molars in size, less than in the caucasian races. (43. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. pp. 320, 321, and 325.) prof. schaaffhausen accounts for this difference between the races by "the posterior dental portion of the jaw being always shortened" in those that are civilised (44. 'on the primitive form of the skull,' eng. translat., in 'anthropological review,' oct. 1868, p. 426), and this shortening may, i presume, be attributed to civilised men habitually feeding on soft, cooked food, and thus using their jaws less. i am informed by mr. brace that it is becoming quite a common practice in the united states to remove some of the molar teeth of children, as the jaw does not grow large enough for the perfect development of the normal number. (45. prof. montegazza writes to me from florence, that he has lately been studying the last molar teeth in the different races of man, and has come to the same conclusion as that given in my text, viz., that in the higher or civilised races they are on the road towards atrophy or elimination.) with respect to the alimentary canal, i have met with an account of only a single rudiment, namely the vermiform appendage of the caecum. the caecum is a branch or diverticulum of the intestine, ending in a cul-de-sac, and is extremely long in many of the lower vegetable-feeding mammals. in the marsupial koala it is actually more than thrice as long as the whole body. (46. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. pp. 416, 434, 441.) it is sometimes produced into a long gradually-tapering point, and is sometimes constricted in parts. it appears as if, in consequence of changed diet or habits, the caecum had become much shortened in various animals, the vermiform appendage being left as a rudiment of the shortened part. that this appendage is a rudiment, we may infer from its small size, and from the evidence which prof. canestrini (47. 'annuario della soc. d. nat.' modena, 1867, p. 94.) has collected of its variability in man. it is occasionally quite absent, or again is largely developed. the passage is sometimes completely closed for half or two-thirds of its length, with the terminal part consisting of a flattened solid expansion. in the orang this appendage is long and convoluted: in man it arises from the end of the short caecum, and is commonly from four to five inches in length, being only about the third of an inch in diameter. not only is it useless, but it is sometimes the cause of death, of which fact i have lately heard two instances: this is due to small hard bodies, such as seeds, entering the passage, and causing inflammation. (48. m. c. martins ("de l'unité organique," in 'revue des deux mondes,' june 15, 1862, p. 16) and haeckel ('generelle morphologie,' b. ii. s. 278), have both remarked on the singular fact of this rudiment sometimes causing death.) in some of the lower quadrumana, in the lemuridae and carnivora, as well as in many marsupials, there is a passage near the lower end of the humerus, called the supra-condyloid foramen, through which the great nerve of the fore limb and often the great artery pass. now in the humerus of man, there is generally a trace of this passage, which is sometimes fairly well developed, being formed by a depending hook-like process of bone, completed by a band of ligament. dr. struthers (49. with respect to inheritance, see dr. struthers in the 'lancet,' feb. 15, 1873, and another important paper, ibid. jan. 24, 1863, p. 83. dr. knox, as i am informed, was the first anatomist who drew attention to this peculiar structure in man; see his 'great artists and anatomists,' p. 63. see also an important memoir on this process by dr. gruber, in the 'bulletin de l'acad. imp. de st. petersbourg,' tom. xii. 1867, p. 448.), who has closely attended to the subject, has now shewn that this peculiarity is sometimes inherited, as it has occurred in a father, and in no less than four out of his seven children. when present, the great nerve invariably passes through it; and this clearly indicates that it is the homologue and rudiment of the supra-condyloid foramen of the lower animals. prof. turner estimates, as he informs me, that it occurs in about one per cent. of recent skeletons. but if the occasional development of this structure in man is, as seems probable, due to reversion, it is a return to a very ancient state of things, because in the higher quadrumana it is absent. there is another foramen or perforation in the humerus, occasionally present in man, which may be called the inter-condyloid. this occurs, but not constantly, in various anthropoid and other apes (50. mr. st. george mivart, 'transactions phil. soc.' 1867, p. 310.), and likewise in many of the lower animals. it is remarkable that this perforation seems to have been present in man much more frequently during ancient times than recently. mr. busk (51. "on the caves of gibraltar," 'transactions of the international congress of prehistoric archaeology,' third session, 1869, p. 159. prof. wyman has lately shewn (fourth annual report, peabody museum, 1871, p. 20), that this perforation is present in thirty-one per cent. of some human remains from ancient mounds in the western united states, and in florida. it frequently occurs in the negro.) has collected the following evidence on this head: prof. broca "noticed the perforation in four and a half per cent. of the arm-bones collected in the 'cimetière du sud,' at paris; and in the grotto of orrony, the contents of which are referred to the bronze period, as many as eight humeri out of thirty-two were perforated; but this extraordinary proportion, he thinks, might be due to the cavern having been a sort of 'family vault.' again, m. dupont found thirty per cent. of perforated bones in the caves of the valley of the lesse, belonging to the reindeer period; whilst m. leguay, in a sort of dolmen at argenteuil, observed twenty-five per cent. to be perforated; and m. pruner-bey found twenty-six per cent. in the same condition in bones from vaureal. nor should it be left unnoticed that m. pruner-bey states that this condition is common in guanche skeletons." it is an interesting fact that ancient races, in this and several other cases, more frequently present structures which resemble those of the lower animals than do the modern. one chief cause seems to be that the ancient races stand somewhat nearer in the long line of descent to their remote animal-like progenitors. in man, the os coccyx, together with certain other vertebrae hereafter to be described, though functionless as a tail, plainly represent this part in other vertebrate animals. at an early embryonic period it is free, and projects beyond the lower extremities; as may be seen in the drawing (fig. 1.) of a human embryo. even after birth it has been known, in certain rare and anomalous cases (52. quatrefages has lately collected the evidence on this subject. 'revue des cours scientifiques,' 1867-1868, p. 625. in 1840 fleischmann exhibited a human foetus bearing a free tail, which, as is not always the case, included vertebral bodies; and this tail was critically examined by the many anatomists present at the meeting of naturalists at erlangen (see marshall in niederlandischen archiv für zoologie, december 1871).), to form a small external rudiment of a tail. the os coccyx is short, usually including only four vertebrae, all anchylosed together: and these are in a rudimentary condition, for they consist, with the exception of the basal one, of the centrum alone. (53. owen, 'on the nature of limbs,' 1849, p. 114.) they are furnished with some small muscles; one of which, as i am informed by prof. turner, has been expressly described by theile as a rudimentary repetition of the extensor of the tail, a muscle which is so largely developed in many mammals. the spinal cord in man extends only as far downwards as the last dorsal or first lumbar vertebra; but a thread-like structure (the filum terminale) runs down the axis of the sacral part of the spinal canal, and even along the back of the coccygeal bones. the upper part of this filament, as prof. turner informs me, is undoubtedly homologous with the spinal cord; but the lower part apparently consists merely of the pia mater, or vascular investing membrane. even in this case the os coccyx may be said to possess a vestige of so important a structure as the spinal cord, though no longer enclosed within a bony canal. the following fact, for which i am also indebted to prof. turner, shews how closely the os coccyx corresponds with the true tail in the lower animals: luschka has recently discovered at the extremity of the coccygeal bones a very peculiar convoluted body, which is continuous with the middle sacral artery; and this discovery led krause and meyer to examine the tail of a monkey (macacus), and of a cat, in both of which they found a similarly convoluted body, though not at the extremity. the reproductive system offers various rudimentary structures; but these differ in one important respect from the foregoing cases. here we are not concerned with the vestige of a part which does not belong to the species in an efficient state, but with a part efficient in the one sex, and represented in the other by a mere rudiment. nevertheless, the occurrence of such rudiments is as difficult to explain, on the belief of the separate creation of each species, as in the foregoing cases. hereafter i shall have to recur to these rudiments, and shall shew that their presence generally depends merely on inheritance, that is, on parts acquired by one sex having been partially transmitted to the other. i will in this place only give some instances of such rudiments. it is well known that in the males of all mammals, including man, rudimentary mammae exist. these in several instances have become well developed, and have yielded a copious supply of milk. their essential identity in the two sexes is likewise shewn by their occasional sympathetic enlargement in both during an attack of the measles. the vesicula prostatica, which has been observed in many male mammals, is now universally acknowledged to be the homologue of the female uterus, together with the connected passage. it is impossible to read leuckart's able description of this organ, and his reasoning, without admitting the justness of his conclusion. this is especially clear in the case of those mammals in which the true female uterus bifurcates, for in the males of these the vesicula likewise bifurcates. (54. leuckart, in todd's 'cyclopaedia of anatomy' 1849-52, vol. iv. p. 1415. in man this organ is only from three to six lines in length, but, like so many other rudimentary parts, it is variable in development as well as in other characters.) some other rudimentary structures belonging to the reproductive system might have been here adduced. (55. see, on this subject, owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. pp. 675, 676, 706.) the bearing of the three great classes of facts now given is unmistakeable. but it would be superfluous fully to recapitulate the line of argument given in detail in my 'origin of species.' the homological construction of the whole frame in the members of the same class is intelligible, if we admit their descent from a common progenitor, together with their subsequent adaptation to diversified conditions. on any other view, the similarity of pattern between the hand of a man or monkey, the foot of a horse, the flipper of a seal, the wing of a bat, etc., is utterly inexplicable. (56. prof. bianconi, in a recently published work, illustrated by admirable engravings ('la théorie darwinienne et la création dite indépendante,' 1874), endeavours to shew that homological structures, in the above and other cases, can be fully explained on mechanical principles, in accordance with their uses. no one has shewn so well, how admirably such structures are adapted for their final purpose; and this adaptation can, as i believe, be explained through natural selection. in considering the wing of a bat, he brings forward (p. 218) what appears to me (to use auguste comte's words) a mere metaphysical principle, namely, the preservation "in its integrity of the mammalian nature of the animal." in only a few cases does he discuss rudiments, and then only those parts which are partially rudimentary, such as the little hoofs of the pig and ox, which do not touch the ground; these he shews clearly to be of service to the animal. it is unfortunate that he did not consider such cases as the minute teeth, which never cut through the jaw in the ox, or the mammae of male quadrupeds, or the wings of certain beetles, existing under the soldered wing-covers, or the vestiges of the pistil and stamens in various flowers, and many other such cases. although i greatly admire prof. bianconi's work, yet the belief now held by most naturalists seems to me left unshaken, that homological structures are inexplicable on the principle of mere adaptation.) it is no scientific explanation to assert that they have all been formed on the same ideal plan. with respect to development, we can clearly understand, on the principle of variations supervening at a rather late embryonic period, and being inherited at a corresponding period, how it is that the embryos of wonderfully different forms should still retain, more or less perfectly, the structure of their common progenitor. no other explanation has ever been given of the marvellous fact that the embryos of a man, dog, seal, bat, reptile, etc., can at first hardly be distinguished from each other. in order to understand the existence of rudimentary organs, we have only to suppose that a former progenitor possessed the parts in question in a perfect state, and that under changed habits of life they became greatly reduced, either from simple disuse, or through the natural selection of those individuals which were least encumbered with a superfluous part, aided by the other means previously indicated. thus we can understand how it has come to pass that man and all other vertebrate animals have been constructed on the same general model, why they pass through the same early stages of development, and why they retain certain rudiments in common. consequently we ought frankly to admit their community of descent: to take any other view, is to admit that our own structure, and that of all the animals around us, is a mere snare laid to entrap our judgment. this conclusion is greatly strengthened, if we look to the members of the whole animal series, and consider the evidence derived from their affinities or classification, their geographical distribution and geological succession. it is only our natural prejudice, and that arrogance which made our forefathers declare that they were descended from demi-gods, which leads us to demur to this conclusion. but the time will before long come, when it will be thought wonderful that naturalists, who were well acquainted with the comparative structure and development of man, and other mammals, should have believed that each was the work of a separate act of creation. chapter ii. on the manner of development of man from some lower form. variability of body and mind in man--inheritance--causes of variability-- laws of variation the same in man as in the lower animals--direct action of the conditions of life--effects of the increased use and disuse of parts-- arrested development--reversion--correlated variation--rate of increase-- checks to increase--natural selection--man the most dominant animal in the world--importance of his corporeal structure--the causes which have led to his becoming erect--consequent changes of structure--decrease in size of the canine teeth--increased size and altered shape of the skull--nakedness --absence of a tail--defenceless condition of man. it is manifest that man is now subject to much variability. no two individuals of the same race are quite alike. we may compare millions of faces, and each will be distinct. there is an equally great amount of diversity in the proportions and dimensions of the various parts of the body; the length of the legs being one of the most variable points. (1. 'investigations in military and anthropological statistics of american soldiers,' by b.a. gould, 1869, p. 256.) although in some quarters of the world an elongated skull, and in other quarters a short skull prevails, yet there is great diversity of shape even within the limits of the same race, as with the aborigines of america and south australia--the latter a race "probably as pure and homogeneous in blood, customs, and language as any in existence"--and even with the inhabitants of so confined an area as the sandwich islands. (2. with respect to the "cranial forms of the american aborigines," see dr. aitken meigs in 'proc. acad. nat. sci.' philadelphia, may 1868. on the australians, see huxley, in lyell's 'antiquity of man,' 1863, p. 87. on the sandwich islanders, prof. j. wyman, 'observations on crania,' boston, 1868, p. 18.) an eminent dentist assures me that there is nearly as much diversity in the teeth as in the features. the chief arteries so frequently run in abnormal courses, that it has been found useful for surgical purposes to calculate from 1040 corpses how often each course prevails. (3. 'anatomy of the arteries,' by r. quain. preface, vol. i. 1844.) the muscles are eminently variable: thus those of the foot were found by prof. turner (4. 'transactions of the royal society of edinburgh,' vol. xxiv. pp. 175, 189.) not to be strictly alike in any two out of fifty bodies; and in some the deviations were considerable. he adds, that the power of performing the appropriate movements must have been modified in accordance with the several deviations. mr. j. wood has recorded (5. 'proceedings royal society,' 1867, p. 544; also 1868, pp. 483, 524. there is a previous paper, 1866, p. 229.) the occurrence of 295 muscular variations in thirty-six subjects, and in another set of the same number no less than 558 variations, those occurring on both sides of the body being only reckoned as one. in the last set, not one body out of the thirty-six was "found totally wanting in departures from the standard descriptions of the muscular system given in anatomical text books." a single body presented the extraordinary number of twenty-five distinct abnormalities. the same muscle sometimes varies in many ways: thus prof. macalister describes (6. 'proc. r. irish academy,' vol. x. 1868, p. 141.) no less than twenty distinct variations in the palmaris accessorius. the famous old anatomist, wolff (7. 'act. acad. st. petersburg,' 1778, part ii. p. 217.), insists that the internal viscera are more variable than the external parts: nulla particula est quae non aliter et aliter in aliis se habeat hominibus. he has even written a treatise on the choice of typical examples of the viscera for representation. a discussion on the beau-ideal of the liver, lungs, kidneys, etc., as of the human face divine, sounds strange in our ears. the variability or diversity of the mental faculties in men of the same race, not to mention the greater differences between the men of distinct races, is so notorious that not a word need here be said. so it is with the lower animals. all who have had charge of menageries admit this fact, and we see it plainly in our dogs and other domestic animals. brehm especially insists that each individual monkey of those which he kept tame in africa had its own peculiar disposition and temper: he mentions one baboon remarkable for its high intelligence; and the keepers in the zoological gardens pointed out to me a monkey, belonging to the new world division, equally remarkable for intelligence. rengger, also, insists on the diversity in the various mental characters of the monkeys of the same species which he kept in paraguay; and this diversity, as he adds, is partly innate, and partly the result of the manner in which they have been treated or educated. (8. brehm, 'thierleben,' b. i. ss. 58, 87. rengger, 'säugethiere von paraguay,' s. 57.) i have elsewhere (9. 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. chap. xii.) so fully discussed the subject of inheritance, that i need here add hardly anything. a greater number of facts have been collected with respect to the transmission of the most trifling, as well as of the most important characters in man, than in any of the lower animals; though the facts are copious enough with respect to the latter. so in regard to mental qualities, their transmission is manifest in our dogs, horses, and other domestic animals. besides special tastes and habits, general intelligence, courage, bad and good temper, etc., are certainly transmitted. with man we see similar facts in almost every family; and we now know, through the admirable labours of mr. galton (10. 'hereditary genius: an inquiry into its laws and consequences,' 1869.), that genius which implies a wonderfully complex combination of high faculties, tends to be inherited; and, on the other hand, it is too certain that insanity and deteriorated mental powers likewise run in families. with respect to the causes of variability, we are in all cases very ignorant; but we can see that in man as in the lower animals, they stand in some relation to the conditions to which each species has been exposed, during several generations. domesticated animals vary more than those in a state of nature; and this is apparently due to the diversified and changing nature of the conditions to which they have been subjected. in this respect the different races of man resemble domesticated animals, and so do the individuals of the same race, when inhabiting a very wide area, like that of america. we see the influence of diversified conditions in the more civilised nations; for the members belonging to different grades of rank, and following different occupations, present a greater range of character than do the members of barbarous nations. but the uniformity of savages has often been exaggerated, and in some cases can hardly be said to exist. (11. mr. bates remarks ('the naturalist on the amazons,' 1863, vol. ii p. 159), with respect to the indians of the same south american tribe, "no two of them were at all similar in the shape of the head; one man had an oval visage with fine features, and another was quite mongolian in breadth and prominence of cheek, spread of nostrils, and obliquity of eyes.") it is, nevertheless, an error to speak of man, even if we look only to the conditions to which he has been exposed, as "far more domesticated" (12. blumenbach, 'treatises on anthropology.' eng. translat., 1865, p. 205.) than any other animal. some savage races, such as the australians, are not exposed to more diversified conditions than are many species which have a wide range. in another and much more important respect, man differs widely from any strictly domesticated animal; for his breeding has never long been controlled, either by methodical or unconscious selection. no race or body of men has been so completely subjugated by other men, as that certain individuals should be preserved, and thus unconsciously selected, from somehow excelling in utility to their masters. nor have certain male and female individuals been intentionally picked out and matched, except in the well-known case of the prussian grenadiers; and in this case man obeyed, as might have been expected, the law of methodical selection; for it is asserted that many tall men were reared in the villages inhabited by the grenadiers and their tall wives. in sparta, also, a form of selection was followed, for it was enacted that all children should be examined shortly after birth; the well-formed and vigorous being preserved, the others left to perish. (13. mitford's 'history of greece,' vol. i. p. 282. it appears also from a passage in xenophon's 'memorabilia,' b. ii. 4 (to which my attention has been called by the rev. j.n. hoare), that it was a well recognised principle with the greeks, that men ought to select their wives with a view to the health and vigour of their children. the grecian poet, theognis, who lived 550 b.c., clearly saw how important selection, if carefully applied, would be for the improvement of mankind. he saw, likewise, that wealth often checks the proper action of sexual selection. he thus writes: "with kine and horses, kurnus! we proceed by reasonable rules, and choose a breed for profit and increase, at any price: of a sound stock, without defect or vice. but, in the daily matches that we make, the price is everything: for money's sake, men marry: women are in marriage given the churl or ruffian, that in wealth has thriven, may match his offspring with the proudest race: thus everything is mix'd, noble and base! if then in outward manner, form, and mind, you find us a degraded, motley kind, wonder no more, my friend! the cause is plain, and to lament the consequence is vain." (the works of j. hookham frere, vol. ii. 1872, p. 334.)) if we consider all the races of man as forming a single species, his range is enormous; but some separate races, as the americans and polynesians, have very wide ranges. it is a well-known law that widely-ranging species are much more variable than species with restricted ranges; and the variability of man may with more truth be compared with that of widely- ranging species, than with that of domesticated animals. not only does variability appear to be induced in man and the lower animals by the same general causes, but in both the same parts of the body are affected in a closely analogous manner. this has been proved in such full detail by godron and quatrefages, that i need here only refer to their works. (14. godron, 'de l'espèce,' 1859, tom. ii. livre 3. quatrefages, 'unité de l'espèce humaine,' 1861. also lectures on anthropology, given in the 'revue des cours scientifiques,' 1866-1868.) monstrosities, which graduate into slight variations, are likewise so similar in man and the lower animals, that the same classification and the same terms can be used for both, as has been shewn by isidore geoffroy st.-hilaire. (15. 'hist. gen. et part. des anomalies de l'organisation,' in three volumes, tom. i. 1832.) in my work on the variation of domestic animals, i have attempted to arrange in a rude fashion the laws of variation under the following heads:--the direct and definite action of changed conditions, as exhibited by all or nearly all the individuals of the same species, varying in the same manner under the same circumstances. the effects of the long- continued use or disuse of parts. the cohesion of homologous parts. the variability of multiple parts. compensation of growth; but of this law i have found no good instance in the case of man. the effects of the mechanical pressure of one part on another; as of the pelvis on the cranium of the infant in the womb. arrests of development, leading to the diminution or suppression of parts. the reappearance of long-lost characters through reversion. and lastly, correlated variation. all these so-called laws apply equally to man and the lower animals; and most of them even to plants. it would be superfluous here to discuss all of them (16. i have fully discussed these laws in my 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. chap. xxii. and xxiii. m. j.p. durand has lately (1868) published a valuable essay, 'de l'influence des milieux,' etc. he lays much stress, in the case of plants, on the nature of the soil.); but several are so important, that they must be treated at considerable length. the direct and definite action of changed conditions. this is a most perplexing subject. it cannot be denied that changed conditions produce some, and occasionally a considerable effect, on organisms of all kinds; and it seems at first probable that if sufficient time were allowed this would be the invariable result. but i have failed to obtain clear evidence in favour of this conclusion; and valid reasons may be urged on the other side, at least as far as the innumerable structures are concerned, which are adapted for special ends. there can, however, be no doubt that changed conditions induce an almost indefinite amount of fluctuating variability, by which the whole organisation is rendered in some degree plastic. in the united states, above 1,000,000 soldiers, who served in the late war, were measured, and the states in which they were born and reared were recorded. (17. 'investigations in military and anthrop. statistics,' etc., 1869, by b.a. gould, pp. 93, 107, 126, 131, 134.) from this astonishing number of observations it is proved that local influences of some kind act directly on stature; and we further learn that "the state where the physical growth has in great measure taken place, and the state of birth, which indicates the ancestry, seem to exert a marked influence on the stature." for instance, it is established, "that residence in the western states, during the years of growth, tends to produce increase of stature." on the other hand, it is certain that with sailors, their life delays growth, as shewn "by the great difference between the statures of soldiers and sailors at the ages of seventeen and eighteen years." mr. b.a. gould endeavoured to ascertain the nature of the influences which thus act on stature; but he arrived only at negative results, namely that they did not relate to climate, the elevation of the land, soil, nor even "in any controlling degree" to the abundance or the need of the comforts of life. this latter conclusion is directly opposed to that arrived at by villerme, from the statistics of the height of the conscripts in different parts of france. when we compare the differences in stature between the polynesian chiefs and the lower orders within the same islands, or between the inhabitants of the fertile volcanic and low barren coral islands of the same ocean (18. for the polynesians, see prichard's 'physical history of mankind,' vol. v. 1847, pp. 145, 283. also godron, 'de l'espèce,' tom. ii. p. 289. there is also a remarkable difference in appearance between the closely-allied hindoos inhabiting the upper ganges and bengal; see elphinstone's 'history of india,' vol. i. p. 324.) or again between the fuegians on the eastern and western shores of their country, where the means of subsistence are very different, it is scarcely possible to avoid the conclusion that better food and greater comfort do influence stature. but the preceding statements shew how difficult it is to arrive at any precise result. dr. beddoe has lately proved that, with the inhabitants of britain, residence in towns and certain occupations have a deteriorating influence on height; and he infers that the result is to a certain extent inherited, as is likewise the case in the united states. dr. beddoe further believes that wherever a "race attains its maximum of physical development, it rises highest in energy and moral vigour." (19. 'memoirs, anthropological society,' vol. iii. 1867-69, pp. 561, 565, 567.) whether external conditions produce any other direct effect on man is not known. it might have been expected that differences of climate would have had a marked influence, inasmuch as the lungs and kidneys are brought into activity under a low temperature, and the liver and skin under a high one. (20. dr. brakenridge, 'theory of diathesis,' 'medical times,' june 19 and july 17, 1869.) it was formerly thought that the colour of the skin and the character of the hair were determined by light or heat; and although it can hardly be denied that some effect is thus produced, almost all observers now agree that the effect has been very small, even after exposure during many ages. but this subject will be more properly discussed when we treat of the different races of mankind. with our domestic animals there are grounds for believing that cold and damp directly affect the growth of the hair; but i have not met with any evidence on this head in the case of man. effects of the increased use and disuse of parts. it is well known that use strengthens the muscles in the individual, and complete disuse, or the destruction of the proper nerve, weakens them. when the eye is destroyed, the optic nerve often becomes atrophied. when an artery is tied, the lateral channels increase not only in diameter, but in the thickness and strength of their coats. when one kidney ceases to act from disease, the other increases in size, and does double work. bones increase not only in thickness, but in length, from carrying a greater weight. (21. i have given authorities for these several statements in my 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. pp. 297- 300. dr. jaeger, "über das langenwachsthum der knochen," 'jenäischen zeitschrift,' b. v. heft. i.) different occupations, habitually followed, lead to changed proportions in various parts of the body. thus it was ascertained by the united states commission (22. 'investigations,' etc., by b.a. gould, 1869, p. 288.) that the legs of the sailors employed in the late war were longer by 0.217 of an inch than those of the soldiers, though the sailors were on an average shorter men; whilst their arms were shorter by 1.09 of an inch, and therefore, out of proportion, shorter in relation to their lesser height. this shortness of the arms is apparently due to their greater use, and is an unexpected result: but sailors chiefly use their arms in pulling, and not in supporting weights. with sailors, the girth of the neck and the depth of the instep are greater, whilst the circumference of the chest, waist, and hips is less, than in soldiers. whether the several foregoing modifications would become hereditary, if the same habits of life were followed during many generations, is not known, but it is probable. rengger (23. 'säugethiere von paraguay,' 1830, s. 4.) attributes the thin legs and thick arms of the payaguas indians to successive generations having passed nearly their whole lives in canoes, with their lower extremities motionless. other writers have come to a similar conclusion in analogous cases. according to cranz (24. 'history of greenland,' eng. translat., 1767, vol. i. p. 230.), who lived for a long time with the esquimaux, "the natives believe that ingenuity and dexterity in seal-catching (their highest art and virtue) is hereditary; there is really something in it, for the son of a celebrated seal-catcher will distinguish himself, though he lost his father in childhood." but in this case it is mental aptitude, quite as much as bodily structure, which appears to be inherited. it is asserted that the hands of english labourers are at birth larger than those of the gentry. (25. 'intermarriage,' by alex. walker, 1838, p. 377.) from the correlation which exists, at least in some cases (26. 'the variation of animals under domestication,' vol. i. p. 173.), between the development of the extremities and of the jaws, it is possible that in those classes which do not labour much with their hands and feet, the jaws would be reduced in size from this cause. that they are generally smaller in refined and civilised men than in hard-working men or savages, is certain. but with savages, as mr. herbert spencer (27. 'principles of biology,' vol. i. p. 455.) has remarked, the greater use of the jaws in chewing coarse, uncooked food, would act in a direct manner on the masticatory muscles, and on the bones to which they are attached. in infants, long before birth, the skin on the soles of the feet is thicker than on any other part of the body; (28. paget, 'lectures on surgical pathology,' vol. ii, 1853, p. 209.) and it can hardly be doubted that this is due to the inherited effects of pressure during a long series of generations. it is familiar to every one that watchmakers and engravers are liable to be short-sighted, whilst men living much out of doors, and especially savages, are generally long-sighted. (29. it is a singular and unexpected fact that sailors are inferior to landsmen in their mean distance of distinct vision. dr. b.a. gould ('sanitary memoirs of the war of the rebellion,' 1869, p. 530), has proved this to be the case; and he accounts for it by the ordinary range of vision in sailors being "restricted to the length of the vessel and the height of the masts.") short-sight and long-sight certainly tend to be inherited. (30. 'the variation of animals under domestication,' vol. i. p. 8.) the inferiority of europeans, in comparison with savages, in eyesight and in the other senses, is no doubt the accumulated and transmitted effect of lessened use during many generations; for rengger (31. 'säugethiere von paraguay,' s. 8, 10. i have had good opportunities for observing the extraordinary power of eyesight in the fuegians. see also lawrence ('lectures on physiology,' etc., 1822, p. 404) on this same subject. m. giraud-teulon has recently collected ('revue des cours scientifiques,' 1870, p. 625) a large and valuable body of evidence proving that the cause of short-sight, "c'est le travail assidu, de près.") states that he has repeatedly observed europeans, who had been brought up and spent their whole lives with the wild indians, who nevertheless did not equal them in the sharpness of their senses. the same naturalist observes that the cavities in the skull for the reception of the several sense- organs are larger in the american aborigines than in europeans; and this probably indicates a corresponding difference in the dimensions of the organs themselves. blumenbach has also remarked on the large size of the nasal cavities in the skulls of the american aborigines, and connects this fact with their remarkably acute power of smell. the mongolians of the plains of northern asia, according to pallas, have wonderfully perfect senses; and prichard believes that the great breadth of their skulls across the zygomas follows from their highly-developed sense organs. (32. prichard, 'physical history of mankind,' on the authority of blumenbach, vol. i. 1851, p. 311; for the statement by pallas, vol. iv. 1844, p. 407.) the quechua indians inhabit the lofty plateaux of peru; and alcide d'orbigny states (33. quoted by prichard, 'researches into the physical history of mankind,' vol. v. p. 463.) that, from continually breathing a highly rarefied atmosphere, they have acquired chests and lungs of extraordinary dimensions. the cells, also, of the lungs are larger and more numerous than in europeans. these observations have been doubted, but mr. d. forbes carefully measured many aymaras, an allied race, living at the height of between 10,000 and 15,000 feet; and he informs me (34. mr. forbes' valuable paper is now published in the 'journal of the ethnological society of london,' new series, vol. ii. 1870, p.193.) that they differ conspicuously from the men of all other races seen by him in the circumference and length of their bodies. in his table of measurements, the stature of each man is taken at 1000, and the other measurements are reduced to this standard. it is here seen that the extended arms of the aymaras are shorter than those of europeans, and much shorter than those of negroes. the legs are likewise shorter; and they present this remarkable peculiarity, that in every aymara measured, the femur is actually shorter than the tibia. on an average, the length of the femur to that of the tibia is as 211 to 252; whilst in two europeans, measured at the same time, the femora to the tibiae were as 244 to 230; and in three negroes as 258 to 241. the humerus is likewise shorter relatively to the forearm. this shortening of that part of the limb which is nearest to the body, appears to be, as suggested to me by mr. forbes, a case of compensation in relation with the greatly increased length of the trunk. the aymaras present some other singular points of structure, for instance, the very small projection of the heel. these men are so thoroughly acclimatised to their cold and lofty abode, that when formerly carried down by the spaniards to the low eastern plains, and when now tempted down by high wages to the gold-washings, they suffer a frightful rate of mortality. nevertheless mr. forbes found a few pure families which had survived during two generations: and he observed that they still inherited their characteristic peculiarities. but it was manifest, even without measurement, that these peculiarities had all decreased; and on measurement, their bodies were found not to be so much elongated as those of the men on the high plateau; whilst their femora had become somewhat lengthened, as had their tibiae, although in a less degree. the actual measurements may be seen by consulting mr. forbes's memoir. from these observations, there can, i think, be no doubt that residence during many generations at a great elevation tends, both directly and indirectly, to induce inherited modifications in the proportions of the body. (35. dr. wilckens ('landwirthschaft. wochenblatt,' no. 10, 1869) has lately published an interesting essay shewing how domestic animals, which live in mountainous regions, have their frames modified.) although man may not have been much modified during the latter stages of his existence through the increased or decreased use of parts, the facts now given shew that his liability in this respect has not been lost; and we positively know that the same law holds good with the lower animals. consequently we may infer that when at a remote epoch the progenitors of man were in a transitional state, and were changing from quadrupeds into bipeds, natural selection would probably have been greatly aided by the inherited effects of the increased or diminished use of the different parts of the body. arrests of development. there is a difference between arrested development and arrested growth, for parts in the former state continue to grow whilst still retaining their early condition. various monstrosities come under this head; and some, as a cleft palate, are known to be occasionally inherited. it will suffice for our purpose to refer to the arrested brain-development of microcephalous idiots, as described in vogt's memoir. (36. 'mémoire sur les microcephales,' 1867, pp. 50, 125, 169, 171, 184-198.) their skulls are smaller, and the convolutions of the brain are less complex than in normal men. the frontal sinus, or the projection over the eye-brows, is largely developed, and the jaws are prognathous to an "effrayant" degree; so that these idiots somewhat resemble the lower types of mankind. their intelligence, and most of their mental faculties, are extremely feeble. they cannot acquire the power of speech, and are wholly incapable of prolonged attention, but are much given to imitation. they are strong and remarkably active, continually gambolling and jumping about, and making grimaces. they often ascend stairs on all-fours; and are curiously fond of climbing up furniture or trees. we are thus reminded of the delight shewn by almost all boys in climbing trees; and this again reminds us how lambs and kids, originally alpine animals, delight to frisk on any hillock, however small. idiots also resemble the lower animals in some other respects; thus several cases are recorded of their carefully smelling every mouthful of food before eating it. one idiot is described as often using his mouth in aid of his hands, whilst hunting for lice. they are often filthy in their habits, and have no sense of decency; and several cases have been published of their bodies being remarkably hairy. (37. prof. laycock sums up the character of brute-like idiots by calling them "theroid;" 'journal of mental science,' july 1863. dr. scott ('the deaf and dumb,' 2nd ed. 1870, p. 10) has often observed the imbecile smelling their food. see, on this same subject, and on the hairiness of idiots, dr. maudsley, 'body and mind,' 1870, pp. 46-51. pinel has also given a striking case of hairiness in an idiot.) reversion. many of the cases to be here given, might have been introduced under the last heading. when a structure is arrested in its development, but still continues growing, until it closely resembles a corresponding structure in some lower and adult member of the same group, it may in one sense be considered as a case of reversion. the lower members in a group give us some idea how the common progenitor was probably constructed; and it is hardly credible that a complex part, arrested at an early phase of embryonic development, should go on growing so as ultimately to perform its proper function, unless it had acquired such power during some earlier state of existence, when the present exceptional or arrested structure was normal. the simple brain of a microcephalous idiot, in as far as it resembles that of an ape, may in this sense be said to offer a case of reversion. (38. in my 'variation of animals under domestication' (vol. ii. p. 57), i attributed the not very rare cases of supernumerary mammae in women to reversion. i was led to this as a probable conclusion, by the additional mammae being generally placed symmetrically on the breast; and more especially from one case, in which a single efficient mamma occurred in the inguinal region of a woman, the daughter of another woman with supernumerary mammae. but i now find (see, for instance, prof. preyer, 'der kampf um das dasein,' 1869, s. 45) that mammae erraticae, occur in other situations, as on the back, in the armpit, and on the thigh; the mammae in this latter instance having given so much milk that the child was thus nourished. the probability that the additional mammae are due to reversion is thus much weakened; nevertheless, it still seems to me probable, because two pairs are often found symmetrically on the breast; and of this i myself have received information in several cases. it is well known that some lemurs normally have two pairs of mammae on the breast. five cases have been recorded of the presence of more than a pair of mammae (of course rudimentary) in the male sex of mankind; see 'journal of anat. and physiology,' 1872, p. 56, for a case given by dr. handyside, in which two brothers exhibited this peculiarity; see also a paper by dr. bartels, in 'reichert's and du bois-reymond's archiv.,' 1872, p. 304. in one of the cases alluded to by dr. bartels, a man bore five mammae, one being medial and placed above the navel; meckel von hemsbach thinks that this latter case is illustrated by a medial mamma occurring in certain cheiroptera. on the whole, we may well doubt if additional mammae would ever have been developed in both sexes of mankind, had not his early progenitors been provided with more than a single pair. in the above work (vol. ii. p. 12), i also attributed, though with much hesitation, the frequent cases of polydactylism in men and various animals to reversion. i was partly led to this through prof. owen's statement, that some of the ichthyopterygia possess more than five digits, and therefore, as i supposed, had retained a primordial condition; but prof. gegenbaur ('jenaischen zeitschrift,' b. v. heft 3, s. 341), disputes owen's conclusion. on the other hand, according to the opinion lately advanced by dr. gunther, on the paddle of ceratodus, which is provided with articulated bony rays on both sides of a central chain of bones, there seems no great difficulty in admitting that six or more digits on one side, or on both sides, might reappear through reversion. i am informed by dr. zouteveen that there is a case on record of a man having twenty-four fingers and twenty-four toes! i was chiefly led to the conclusion that the presence of supernumerary digits might be due to reversion from the fact that such digits, not only are strongly inherited, but, as i then believed, had the power of regrowth after amputation, like the normal digits of the lower vertebrata. but i have explained in the second edition of my variation under domestication why i now place little reliance on the recorded cases of such regrowth. nevertheless it deserves notice, inasmuch as arrested development and reversion are intimately related processes; that various structures in an embryonic or arrested condition, such as a cleft palate, bifid uterus, etc., are frequently accompanied by polydactylism. this has been strongly insisted on by meckel and isidore geoffroy st.-hilaire. but at present it is the safest course to give up altogether the idea that there is any relation between the development of supernumerary digits and reversion to some lowly organised progenitor of man.) there are other cases which come more strictly under our present head of reversion. certain structures, regularly occurring in the lower members of the group to which man belongs, occasionally make their appearance in him, though not found in the normal human embryo; or, if normally present in the human embryo, they become abnormally developed, although in a manner which is normal in the lower members of the group. these remarks will be rendered clearer by the following illustrations. in various mammals the uterus graduates from a double organ with two distinct orifices and two passages, as in the marsupials, into a single organ, which is in no way double except from having a slight internal fold, as in the higher apes and man. the rodents exhibit a perfect series of gradations between these two extreme states. in all mammals the uterus is developed from two simple primitive tubes, the inferior portions of which form the cornua; and it is in the words of dr. farre, "by the coalescence of the two cornua at their lower extremities that the body of the uterus is formed in man; while in those animals in which no middle portion or body exists, the cornua remain ununited. as the development of the uterus proceeds, the two cornua become gradually shorter, until at length they are lost, or, as it were, absorbed into the body of the uterus." the angles of the uterus are still produced into cornua, even in animals as high up in the scale as the lower apes and lemurs. now in women, anomalous cases are not very infrequent, in which the mature uterus is furnished with cornua, or is partially divided into two organs; and such cases, according to owen, repeat "the grade of concentrative development," attained by certain rodents. here perhaps we have an instance of a simple arrest of embryonic development, with subsequent growth and perfect functional development; for either side of the partially double uterus is capable of performing the proper office of gestation. in other and rarer cases, two distinct uterine cavities are formed, each having its proper orifice and passage. (39. see dr. a. farre's well-known article in the 'cyclopaedia of anatomy and physiology,' vol. v. 1859, p. 642. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. 1868, p. 687. professor turner, in 'edinburgh medical journal,' february, 1865.) no such stage is passed through during the ordinary development of the embryo; and it is difficult to believe, though perhaps not impossible, that the two simple, minute, primitive tubes should know how (if such an expression may be used) to grow into two distinct uteri, each with a well-constructed orifice and passage, and each furnished with numerous muscles, nerves, glands and vessels, if they had not formerly passed through a similar course of development, as in the case of existing marsupials. no one will pretend that so perfect a structure as the abnormal double uterus in woman could be the result of mere chance. but the principle of reversion, by which a long-lost structure is called back into existence, might serve as the guide for its full development, even after the lapse of an enormous interval of time. professor canestrini, after discussing the foregoing and various analogous cases, arrives at the same conclusion as that just given. he adduces another instance, in the case of the malar bone (40. 'annuario della soc. dei naturalisti,' modena, 1867, p. 83. prof. canestrini gives extracts on this subject from various authorities. laurillard remarks, that as he has found a complete similarity in the form, proportions, and connection of the two malar bones in several human subjects and in certain apes, he cannot consider this disposition of the parts as simply accidental. another paper on this same anomaly has been published by dr. saviotti in the 'gazzetta delle cliniche,' turin, 1871, where he says that traces of the division may be detected in about two per cent. of adult skulls; he also remarks that it more frequently occurs in prognathous skulls, not of the aryan race, than in others. see also g. delorenzi on the same subject; 'tre nuovi casi d'anomalia dell' osso malare,' torino, 1872. also, e. morselli, 'sopra una rara anomalia dell' osso malare,' modena, 1872. still more recently gruber has written a pamphlet on the division of this bone. i give these references because a reviewer, without any grounds or scruples, has thrown doubts on my statements.), which, in some of the quadrumana and other mammals, normally consists of two portions. this is its condition in the human foetus when two months old; and through arrested development, it sometimes remains thus in man when adult, more especially in the lower prognathous races. hence canestrini concludes that some ancient progenitor of man must have had this bone normally divided into two portions, which afterwards became fused together. in man the frontal bone consists of a single piece, but in the embryo, and in children, and in almost all the lower mammals, it consists of two pieces separated by a distinct suture. this suture occasionally persists more or less distinctly in man after maturity; and more frequently in ancient than in recent crania, especially, as canestrini has observed, in those exhumed from the drift, and belonging to the brachycephalic type. here again he comes to the same conclusion as in the analogous case of the malar bones. in this, and other instances presently to be given, the cause of ancient races approaching the lower animals in certain characters more frequently than do the modern races, appears to be, that the latter stand at a somewhat greater distance in the long line of descent from their early semi-human progenitors. various other anomalies in man, more or less analogous to the foregoing, have been advanced by different authors, as cases of reversion; but these seem not a little doubtful, for we have to descend extremely low in the mammalian series, before we find such structures normally present. (41. a whole series of cases is given by isidore geoffroy st.-hilaire, 'hist. des anomalies,' tom, iii, p. 437. a reviewer ('journal of anatomy and physiology,' 1871, p. 366) blames me much for not having discussed the numerous cases, which have been recorded, of various parts arrested in their development. he says that, according to my theory, "every transient condition of an organ, during its development, is not only a means to an end, but once was an end in itself." this does not seem to me necessarily to hold good. why should not variations occur during an early period of development, having no relation to reversion; yet such variations might be preserved and accumulated, if in any way serviceable, for instance, in shortening and simplifying the course of development? and again, why should not injurious abnormalities, such as atrophied or hypertrophied parts, which have no relation to a former state of existence, occur at an early period, as well as during maturity?) in man, the canine teeth are perfectly efficient instruments for mastication. but their true canine character, as owen (42. 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. 1868, p. 323.) remarks, "is indicated by the conical form of the crown, which terminates in an obtuse point, is convex outward and flat or sub-concave within, at the base of which surface there is a feeble prominence. the conical form is best expressed in the melanian races, especially the australian. the canine is more deeply implanted, and by a stronger fang than the incisors." nevertheless, this tooth no longer serves man as a special weapon for tearing his enemies or prey; it may, therefore, as far as its proper function is concerned, be considered as rudimentary. in every large collection of human skulls some may be found, as haeckel (43. 'generelle morphologie,' 1866, b. ii. s. clv.) observes, with the canine teeth projecting considerably beyond the others in the same manner as in the anthropomorphous apes, but in a less degree. in these cases, open spaces between the teeth in the one jaw are left for the reception of the canines of the opposite jaw. an inter-space of this kind in a kaffir skull, figured by wagner, is surprisingly wide. (44. carl vogt's 'lectures on man,' eng. translat., 1864, p. 151.) considering how few are the ancient skulls which have been examined, compared to recent skulls, it is an interesting fact that in at least three cases the canines project largely; and in the naulette jaw they are spoken of as enormous. (45. c. carter blake, on a jaw from la naulette, 'anthropological review,' 1867, p. 295. schaaffhausen, ibid. 1868, p. 426.) of the anthropomorphous apes the males alone have their canines fully developed; but in the female gorilla, and in a less degree in the female orang, these teeth project considerably beyond the others; therefore the fact, of which i have been assured, that women sometimes have considerably projecting canines, is no serious objection to the belief that their occasional great development in man is a case of reversion to an ape-like progenitor. he who rejects with scorn the belief that the shape of his own canines, and their occasional great development in other men, are due to our early forefathers having been provided with these formidable weapons, will probably reveal, by sneering, the line of his descent. for though he no longer intends, nor has the power, to use these teeth as weapons, he will unconsciously retract his "snarling muscles" (thus named by sir c. bell) (46. the anatomy of expression, 1844, pp. 110, 131.), so as to expose them ready for action, like a dog prepared to fight. many muscles are occasionally developed in man, which are proper to the quadrumana or other mammals. professor vlacovich (47. quoted by prof. canestrini in the 'annuario della soc. dei naturalisti,' 1867, p. 90.) examined forty male subjects, and found a muscle, called by him the ischio- pubic, in nineteen of them; in three others there was a ligament which represented this muscle; and in the remaining eighteen no trace of it. in only two out of thirty female subjects was this muscle developed on both sides, but in three others the rudimentary ligament was present. this muscle, therefore, appears to be much more common in the male than in the female sex; and on the belief in the descent of man from some lower form, the fact is intelligible; for it has been detected in several of the lower animals, and in all of these it serves exclusively to aid the male in the act of reproduction. mr. j. wood, in his valuable series of papers (48. these papers deserve careful study by any one who desires to learn how frequently our muscles vary, and in varying come to resemble those of the quadrumana. the following references relate to the few points touched on in my text: 'proc. royal soc.' vol. xiv. 1865, pp. 379-384; vol. xv. 1866, pp. 241, 242; vol. xv. 1867, p. 544; vol. xvi. 1868, p. 524. i may here add that dr. murie and mr. st. george mivart have shewn in their memoir on the lemuroidea ('transactions, zoological society,' vol. vii. 1869, p. 96), how extraordinarily variable some of the muscles are in these animals, the lowest members of the primates. gradations, also, in the muscles leading to structures found in animals still lower in the scale, are numerous in the lemuroidea.), has minutely described a vast number of muscular variations in man, which resemble normal structures in the lower animals. the muscles which closely resemble those regularly present in our nearest allies, the quadrumana, are too numerous to be here even specified. in a single male subject, having a strong bodily frame, and well-formed skull, no less than seven muscular variations were observed, all of which plainly represented muscles proper to various kinds of apes. this man, for instance, had on both sides of his neck a true and powerful "levator claviculae," such as is found in all kinds of apes, and which is said to occur in about one out of sixty human subjects. (49. see also prof. macalister in 'proceedings, royal irish academy,' vol. x. 1868, p. 124.) again, this man had "a special abductor of the metatarsal bone of the fifth digit, such as professor huxley and mr. flower have shewn to exist uniformly in the higher and lower apes." i will give only two additional cases; the acromio-basilar muscle is found in all mammals below man, and seems to be correlated with a quadrupedal gait, (50. mr. champneys in 'journal of anatomy and physiology,' nov. 1871, p. 178.) and it occurs in about one out of sixty human subjects. in the lower extremities mr. bradley (51. ibid. may 1872, p. 421.) found an abductor ossis metatarsi quinti in both feet of man; this muscle had not up to that time been recorded in mankind, but is always present in the anthropomorphous apes. the muscles of the hands and arms--parts which are so eminently characteristic of man--are extremely liable to vary, so as to resemble the corresponding muscles in the lower animals. (52. prof. macalister (ibid. p. 121) has tabulated his observations, and finds that muscular abnormalities are most frequent in the fore-arms, secondly, in the face, thirdly, in the foot, etc.) such resemblances are either perfect or imperfect; yet in the latter case they are manifestly of a transitional nature. certain variations are more common in man, and others in woman, without our being able to assign any reason. mr. wood, after describing numerous variations, makes the following pregnant remark. "notable departures from the ordinary type of the muscular structures run in grooves or directions, which must be taken to indicate some unknown factor, of much importance to a comprehensive knowledge of general and scientific anatomy." (53. the rev. dr. haughton, after giving ('proc. r. irish academy,' june 27, 1864, p. 715) a remarkable case of variation in the human flexor pollicis longus, adds, "this remarkable example shews that man may sometimes possess the arrangement of tendons of thumb and fingers characteristic of the macaque; but whether such a case should be regarded as a macaque passing upwards into a man, or a man passing downwards into a macaque, or as a congenital freak of nature, i cannot undertake to say." it is satisfactory to hear so capable an anatomist, and so embittered an opponent of evolutionism, admitting even the possibility of either of his first propositions. prof. macalister has also described ('proceedings royal irish academy,' vol. x. 1864, p. 138) variations in the flexor pollicis longus, remarkable from their relations to the same muscle in the quadrumana.) that this unknown factor is reversion to a former state of existence may be admitted as in the highest degree probable. (54. since the first edition of this book appeared, mr. wood has published another memoir in the philosophical transactions, 1870, p. 83, on the varieties of the muscles of the human neck, shoulder, and chest. he here shews how extremely variable these muscles are, and how often and how closely the variations resemble the normal muscles of the lower animals. he sums up by remarking, "it will be enough for my purpose if i have succeeded in shewing the more important forms which, when occurring as varieties in the human subject, tend to exhibit in a sufficiently marked manner what may be considered as proofs and examples of the darwinian principle of reversion, or law of inheritance, in this department of anatomical science.") it is quite incredible that a man should through mere accident abnormally resemble certain apes in no less than seven of his muscles, if there had been no genetic connection between them. on the other hand, if man is descended from some ape-like creature, no valid reason can be assigned why certain muscles should not suddenly reappear after an interval of many thousand generations, in the same manner as with horses, asses, and mules, dark- coloured stripes suddenly reappear on the legs, and shoulders, after an interval of hundreds, or more probably of thousands of generations. these various cases of reversion are so closely related to those of rudimentary organs given in the first chapter, that many of them might have been indifferently introduced either there or here. thus a human uterus furnished with cornua may be said to represent, in a rudimentary condition, the same organ in its normal state in certain mammals. some parts which are rudimentary in man, as the os coccyx in both sexes, and the mammae in the male sex, are always present; whilst others, such as the supracondyloid foramen, only occasionally appear, and therefore might have been introduced under the head of reversion. these several reversionary structures, as well as the strictly rudimentary ones, reveal the descent of man from some lower form in an unmistakable manner. correlated variation. in man, as in the lower animals, many structures are so intimately related, that when one part varies so does another, without our being able, in most cases, to assign any reason. we cannot say whether the one part governs the other, or whether both are governed by some earlier developed part. various monstrosities, as i. geoffroy repeatedly insists, are thus intimately connected. homologous structures are particularly liable to change together, as we see on the opposite sides of the body, and in the upper and lower extremities. meckel long ago remarked, that when the muscles of the arm depart from their proper type, they almost always imitate those of the leg; and so, conversely, with the muscles of the legs. the organs of sight and hearing, the teeth and hair, the colour of the skin and of the hair, colour and constitution, are more or less correlated. (55. the authorities for these several statements are given in my 'variation of animals under domestication,' vol. ii. pp. 320-335.) professor schaaffhausen first drew attention to the relation apparently existing between a muscular frame and the strongly-pronounced supra-orbital ridges, which are so characteristic of the lower races of man. besides the variations which can be grouped with more or less probability under the foregoing heads, there is a large class of variations which may be provisionally called spontaneous, for to our ignorance they appear to arise without any exciting cause. it can, however, be shewn that such variations, whether consisting of slight individual differences, or of strongly-marked and abrupt deviations of structure, depend much more on the constitution of the organism than on the nature of the conditions to which it has been subjected. (56. this whole subject has been discussed in chap. xxiii. vol. ii. of my 'variation of animals and plants under domestication.') rate of increase. civilised populations have been known under favourable conditions, as in the united states, to double their numbers in twenty-five years; and, according to a calculation, by euler, this might occur in a little over twelve years. (57. see the ever memorable 'essay on the principle of population,' by the rev. t. malthus, vol. i. 1826. pp. 6, 517.) at the former rate, the present population of the united states (thirty millions), would in 657 years cover the whole terraqueous globe so thickly, that four men would have to stand on each square yard of surface. the primary or fundamental check to the continued increase of man is the difficulty of gaining subsistence, and of living in comfort. we may infer that this is the case from what we see, for instance, in the united states, where subsistence is easy, and there is plenty of room. if such means were suddenly doubled in great britain, our number would be quickly doubled. with civilised nations this primary check acts chiefly by restraining marriages. the greater death-rate of infants in the poorest classes is also very important; as well as the greater mortality, from various diseases, of the inhabitants of crowded and miserable houses, at all ages. the effects of severe epidemics and wars are soon counterbalanced, and more than counterbalanced, in nations placed under favourable conditions. emigration also comes in aid as a temporary check, but, with the extremely poor classes, not to any great extent. there is reason to suspect, as malthus has remarked, that the reproductive power is actually less in barbarous, than in civilised races. we know nothing positively on this head, for with savages no census has been taken; but from the concurrent testimony of missionaries, and of others who have long resided with such people, it appears that their families are usually small, and large ones rare. this may be partly accounted for, as it is believed, by the women suckling their infants during a long time; but it is highly probable that savages, who often suffer much hardship, and who do not obtain so much nutritious food as civilised men, would be actually less prolific. i have shewn in a former work (58. 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol ii. pp. 111-113, 163.), that all our domesticated quadrupeds and birds, and all our cultivated plants, are more fertile than the corresponding species in a state of nature. it is no valid objection to this conclusion that animals suddenly supplied with an excess of food, or when grown very fat; and that most plants on sudden removal from very poor to very rich soil, are rendered more or less sterile. we might, therefore, expect that civilised men, who in one sense are highly domesticated, would be more prolific than wild men. it is also probable that the increased fertility of civilised nations would become, as with our domestic animals, an inherited character: it is at least known that with mankind a tendency to produce twins runs in families. (59. mr. sedgwick, 'british and foreign medico-chirurgical review,' july 1863, p. 170.) notwithstanding that savages appear to be less prolific than civilised people, they would no doubt rapidly increase if their numbers were not by some means rigidly kept down. the santali, or hill-tribes of india, have recently afforded a good illustration of this fact; for, as shewn by mr. hunter (60. 'the annals of rural bengal,' by w.w. hunter, 1868, p. 259.), they have increased at an extraordinary rate since vaccination has been introduced, other pestilences mitigated, and war sternly repressed. this increase, however, would not have been possible had not these rude people spread into the adjoining districts, and worked for hire. savages almost always marry; yet there is some prudential restraint, for they do not commonly marry at the earliest possible age. the young men are often required to shew that they can support a wife; and they generally have first to earn the price with which to purchase her from her parents. with savages the difficulty of obtaining subsistence occasionally limits their number in a much more direct manner than with civilised people, for all tribes periodically suffer from severe famines. at such times savages are forced to devour much bad food, and their health can hardly fail to be injured. many accounts have been published of their protruding stomachs and emaciated limbs after and during famines. they are then, also, compelled to wander much, and, as i was assured in australia, their infants perish in large numbers. as famines are periodical, depending chiefly on extreme seasons, all tribes must fluctuate in number. they cannot steadily and regularly increase, as there is no artificial increase in the supply of food. savages, when hard pressed, encroach on each other's territories, and war is the result; but they are indeed almost always at war with their neighbours. they are liable to many accidents on land and water in their search for food; and in some countries they suffer much from the larger beasts of prey. even in india, districts have been depopulated by the ravages of tigers. malthus has discussed these several checks, but he does not lay stress enough on what is probably the most important of all, namely infanticide, especially of female infants, and the habit of procuring abortion. these practices now prevail in many quarters of the world; and infanticide seems formerly to have prevailed, as mr. m'lennan (61. 'primitive marriage,' 1865.) has shewn, on a still more extensive scale. these practices appear to have originated in savages recognising the difficulty, or rather the impossibility of supporting all the infants that are born. licentiousness may also be added to the foregoing checks; but this does not follow from failing means of subsistence; though there is reason to believe that in some cases (as in japan) it has been intentionally encouraged as a means of keeping down the population. if we look back to an extremely remote epoch, before man had arrived at the dignity of manhood, he would have been guided more by instinct and less by reason than are the lowest savages at the present time. our early semi- human progenitors would not have practised infanticide or polyandry; for the instincts of the lower animals are never so perverted (62. a writer in the 'spectator' (march 12, 1871, p. 320) comments as follows on this passage:--"mr. darwin finds himself compelled to reintroduce a new doctrine of the fall of man. he shews that the instincts of the higher animals are far nobler than the habits of savage races of men, and he finds himself, therefore, compelled to re-introduce,--in a form of the substantial orthodoxy of which he appears to be quite unconscious,--and to introduce as a scientific hypothesis the doctrine that man's gain of knowledge was the cause of a temporary but long-enduring moral deterioration as indicated by the many foul customs, especially as to marriage, of savage tribes. what does the jewish tradition of the moral degeneration of man through his snatching at a knowledge forbidden him by his highest instinct assert beyond this?") as to lead them regularly to destroy their own offspring, or to be quite devoid of jealousy. there would have been no prudential restraint from marriage, and the sexes would have freely united at an early age. hence the progenitors of man would have tended to increase rapidly; but checks of some kind, either periodical or constant, must have kept down their numbers, even more severely than with existing savages. what the precise nature of these checks were, we cannot say, any more than with most other animals. we know that horses and cattle, which are not extremely prolific animals, when first turned loose in south america, increased at an enormous rate. the elephant, the slowest breeder of all known animals, would in a few thousand years stock the whole world. the increase of every species of monkey must be checked by some means; but not, as brehm remarks, by the attacks of beasts of prey. no one will assume that the actual power of reproduction in the wild horses and cattle of america, was at first in any sensible degree increased; or that, as each district became fully stocked, this same power was diminished. no doubt, in this case, and in all others, many checks concur, and different checks under different circumstances; periodical dearths, depending on unfavourable seasons, being probably the most important of all. so it will have been with the early progenitors of man. natural selection. we have now seen that man is variable in body and mind; and that the variations are induced, either directly or indirectly, by the same general causes, and obey the same general laws, as with the lower animals. man has spread widely over the face of the earth, and must have been exposed, during his incessant migrations (63. see some good remarks to this effect by w. stanley jevons, "a deduction from darwin's theory," 'nature,' 1869, p. 231.), to the most diversified conditions. the inhabitants of tierra del fuego, the cape of good hope, and tasmania in the one hemisphere, and of the arctic regions in the other, must have passed through many climates, and changed their habits many times, before they reached their present homes. (64. latham, 'man and his migrations,' 1851, p. 135.) the early progenitors of man must also have tended, like all other animals, to have increased beyond their means of subsistence; they must, therefore, occasionally have been exposed to a struggle for existence, and consequently to the rigid law of natural selection. beneficial variations of all kinds will thus, either occasionally or habitually, have been preserved and injurious ones eliminated. i do not refer to strongly-marked deviations of structure, which occur only at long intervals of time, but to mere individual differences. we know, for instance, that the muscles of our hands and feet, which determine our powers of movement, are liable, like those of the lower animals, (65. messrs. murie and mivart in their 'anatomy of the lemuroidea' ('transact. zoolog. soc.' vol. vii. 1869, pp. 96-98) say, "some muscles are so irregular in their distribution that they cannot be well classed in any of the above groups." these muscles differ even on the opposite sides of the same individual.) to incessant variability. if then the progenitors of man inhabiting any district, especially one undergoing some change in its conditions, were divided into two equal bodies, the one half which included all the individuals best adapted by their powers of movement for gaining subsistence, or for defending themselves, would on an average survive in greater numbers, and procreate more offspring than the other and less well endowed half. man in the rudest state in which he now exists is the most dominant animal that has ever appeared on this earth. he has spread more widely than any other highly organised form: and all others have yielded before him. he manifestly owes this immense superiority to his intellectual faculties, to his social habits, which lead him to aid and defend his fellows, and to his corporeal structure. the supreme importance of these characters has been proved by the final arbitrament of the battle for life. through his powers of intellect, articulate language has been evolved; and on this his wonderful advancement has mainly depended. as mr. chauncey wright remarks (66. limits of natural selection, 'north american review,' oct. 1870, p. 295.): "a psychological analysis of the faculty of language shews, that even the smallest proficiency in it might require more brain power than the greatest proficiency in any other direction." he has invented and is able to use various weapons, tools, traps, etc., with which he defends himself, kills or catches prey, and otherwise obtains food. he has made rafts or canoes for fishing or crossing over to neighbouring fertile islands. he has discovered the art of making fire, by which hard and stringy roots can be rendered digestible, and poisonous roots or herbs innocuous. this discovery of fire, probably the greatest ever made by man, excepting language, dates from before the dawn of history. these several inventions, by which man in the rudest state has become so pre-eminent, are the direct results of the development of his powers of observation, memory, curiosity, imagination, and reason. i cannot, therefore, understand how it is that mr. wallace (67. 'quarterly review,' april 1869, p. 392. this subject is more fully discussed in mr. wallace's 'contributions to the theory of natural selection,' 1870, in which all the essays referred to in this work are re-published. the 'essay on man,' has been ably criticised by prof. claparede, one of the most distinguished zoologists in europe, in an article published in the 'bibliotheque universelle,' june 1870. the remark quoted in my text will surprise every one who has read mr. wallace's celebrated paper on 'the origin of human races deduced from the theory of natural selection,' originally published in the 'anthropological review,' may 1864, p. clviii. i cannot here resist quoting a most just remark by sir j. lubbock ('prehistoric times,' 1865, p. 479) in reference to this paper, namely, that mr. wallace, "with characteristic unselfishness, ascribes it (i.e. the idea of natural selection) unreservedly to mr. darwin, although, as is well known, he struck out the idea independently, and published it, though not with the same elaboration, at the same time.") maintains, that "natural selection could only have endowed the savage with a brain a little superior to that of an ape." although the intellectual powers and social habits of man are of paramount importance to him, we must not underrate the importance of his bodily structure, to which subject the remainder of this chapter will be devoted; the development of the intellectual and social or moral faculties being discussed in a later chapter. even to hammer with precision is no easy matter, as every one who has tried to learn carpentry will admit. to throw a stone with as true an aim as a fuegian in defending himself, or in killing birds, requires the most consummate perfection in the correlated action of the muscles of the hand, arm, and shoulder, and, further, a fine sense of touch. in throwing a stone or spear, and in many other actions, a man must stand firmly on his feet; and this again demands the perfect co-adaptation of numerous muscles. to chip a flint into the rudest tool, or to form a barbed spear or hook from a bone, demands the use of a perfect hand; for, as a most capable judge, mr. schoolcraft (68. quoted by mr. lawson tait in his 'law of natural selection,' 'dublin quarterly journal of medical science,' feb. 1869. dr. keller is likewise quoted to the same effect.), remarks, the shaping fragments of stone into knives, lances, or arrow-heads, shews "extraordinary ability and long practice." this is to a great extent proved by the fact that primeval men practised a division of labour; each man did not manufacture his own flint tools or rude pottery, but certain individuals appear to have devoted themselves to such work, no doubt receiving in exchange the produce of the chase. archaeologists are convinced that an enormous interval of time elapsed before our ancestors thought of grinding chipped flints into smooth tools. one can hardly doubt, that a man-like animal who possessed a hand and arm sufficiently perfect to throw a stone with precision, or to form a flint into a rude tool, could, with sufficient practice, as far as mechanical skill alone is concerned, make almost anything which a civilised man can make. the structure of the hand in this respect may be compared with that of the vocal organs, which in the apes are used for uttering various signal-cries, or, as in one genus, musical cadences; but in man the closely similar vocal organs have become adapted through the inherited effects of use for the utterance of articulate language. turning now to the nearest allies of men, and therefore to the best representatives of our early progenitors, we find that the hands of the quadrumana are constructed on the same general pattern as our own, but are far less perfectly adapted for diversified uses. their hands do not serve for locomotion so well as the feet of a dog; as may be seen in such monkeys as the chimpanzee and orang, which walk on the outer margins of the palms, or on the knuckles. (69. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 71.) their hands, however, are admirably adapted for climbing trees. monkeys seize thin branches or ropes, with the thumb on one side and the fingers and palm on the other, in the same manner as we do. they can thus also lift rather large objects, such as the neck of a bottle, to their mouths. baboons turn over stones, and scratch up roots with their hands. they seize nuts, insects, or other small objects with the thumb in opposition to the fingers, and no doubt they thus extract eggs and young from the nests of birds. american monkeys beat the wild oranges on the branches until the rind is cracked, and then tear it off with the fingers of the two hands. in a wild state they break open hard fruits with stones. other monkeys open mussel-shells with the two thumbs. with their fingers they pull out thorns and burs, and hunt for each other's parasites. they roll down stones, or throw them at their enemies: nevertheless, they are clumsy in these various actions, and, as i have myself seen, are quite unable to throw a stone with precision. it seems to me far from true that because "objects are grasped clumsily" by monkeys, "a much less specialised organ of prehension" would have served them (70. 'quarterly review,' april 1869, p. 392.) equally well with their present hands. on the contrary, i see no reason to doubt that more perfectly constructed hands would have been an advantage to them, provided that they were not thus rendered less fitted for climbing trees. we may suspect that a hand as perfect as that of man would have been disadvantageous for climbing; for the most arboreal monkeys in the world, namely, ateles in america, colobus in africa, and hylobates in asia, are either thumbless, or their toes partially cohere, so that their limbs are converted into mere grasping hooks. (71. in hylobates syndactylus, as the name expresses, two of the toes regularly cohere; and this, as mr. blyth informs me, is occasionally the case with the toes of h. agilis, lar, and leuciscus. colobus is strictly arboreal and extraordinarily active (brehm, 'thierleben,' b. i. s. 50), but whether a better climber than the species of the allied genera, i do not know. it deserves notice that the feet of the sloths, the most arboreal animals in the world, are wonderfully hook-like. as soon as some ancient member in the great series of the primates came to be less arboreal, owing to a change in its manner of procuring subsistence, or to some change in the surrounding conditions, its habitual manner of progression would have been modified: and thus it would have been rendered more strictly quadrupedal or bipedal. baboons frequent hilly and rocky districts, and only from necessity climb high trees (72. brehm, 'thierleben,' b. i. s. 80.); and they have acquired almost the gait of a dog. man alone has become a biped; and we can, i think, partly see how he has come to assume his erect attitude, which forms one of his most conspicuous characters. man could not have attained his present dominant position in the world without the use of his hands, which are so admirably adapted to act in obedience to his will. sir c. bell (73. 'the hand,' etc., 'bridgewater treatise,' 1833, p. 38.) insists that "the hand supplies all instruments, and by its correspondence with the intellect gives him universal dominion." but the hands and arms could hardly have become perfect enough to have manufactured weapons, or to have hurled stones and spears with a true aim, as long as they were habitually used for locomotion and for supporting the whole weight of the body, or, as before remarked, so long as they were especially fitted for climbing trees. such rough treatment would also have blunted the sense of touch, on which their delicate use largely depends. from these causes alone it would have been an advantage to man to become a biped; but for many actions it is indispensable that the arms and whole upper part of the body should be free; and he must for this end stand firmly on his feet. to gain this great advantage, the feet have been rendered flat; and the great toe has been peculiarly modified, though this has entailed the almost complete loss of its power of prehension. it accords with the principle of the division of physiological labour, prevailing throughout the animal kingdom, that as the hands became perfected for prehension, the feet should have become perfected for support and locomotion. with some savages, however, the foot has not altogether lost its prehensile power, as shewn by their manner of climbing trees, and of using them in other ways. (74. haeckel has an excellent discussion on the steps by which man became a biped: 'natürliche schöpfungsgeschichte,' 1868, s. 507. dr. buchner ('conférences sur la théorie darwinienne,' 1869, p. 135) has given good cases of the use of the foot as a prehensile organ by man; and has also written on the manner of progression of the higher apes, to which i allude in the following paragraph: see also owen ('anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 71) on this latter subject.) if it be an advantage to man to stand firmly on his feet and to have his hands and arms free, of which, from his pre-eminent success in the battle of life there can be no doubt, then i can see no reason why it should not have been advantageous to the progenitors of man to have become more and more erect or bipedal. they would thus have been better able to defend themselves with stones or clubs, to attack their prey, or otherwise to obtain food. the best built individuals would in the long run have succeeded best, and have survived in larger numbers. if the gorilla and a few allied forms had become extinct, it might have been argued, with great force and apparent truth, that an animal could not have been gradually converted from a quadruped into a biped, as all the individuals in an intermediate condition would have been miserably ill-fitted for progression. but we know (and this is well worthy of reflection) that the anthropomorphous apes are now actually in an intermediate condition; and no one doubts that they are on the whole well adapted for their conditions of life. thus the gorilla runs with a sidelong shambling gait, but more commonly progresses by resting on its bent hands. the long-armed apes occasionally use their arms like crutches, swinging their bodies forward between them, and some kinds of hylobates, without having been taught, can walk or run upright with tolerable quickness; yet they move awkwardly, and much less securely than man. we see, in short, in existing monkeys a manner of progression intermediate between that of a quadruped and a biped; but, as an unprejudiced judge (75. prof. broca, la constitution des vertèbres caudales; 'la revue d'anthropologie,' 1872, p. 26, (separate copy).) insists, the anthropomorphous apes approach in structure more nearly to the bipedal than to the quadrupedal type. as the progenitors of man became more and more erect, with their hands and arms more and more modified for prehension and other purposes, with their feet and legs at the same time transformed for firm support and progression, endless other changes of structure would have become necessary. the pelvis would have to be broadened, the spine peculiarly curved, and the head fixed in an altered position, all which changes have been attained by man. prof. schaaffhausen (76. 'on the primitive form of the skull,' translated in 'anthropological review,' oct. 1868, p. 428. owen ('anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. ii. 1866, p. 551) on the mastoid processes in the higher apes.) maintains that "the powerful mastoid processes of the human skull are the result of his erect position;" and these processes are absent in the orang, chimpanzee, etc., and are smaller in the gorilla than in man. various other structures, which appear connected with man's erect position, might here have been added. it is very difficult to decide how far these correlated modifications are the result of natural selection, and how far of the inherited effects of the increased use of certain parts, or of the action of one part on another. no doubt these means of change often co-operate: thus when certain muscles, and the crests of bone to which they are attached, become enlarged by habitual use, this shews that certain actions are habitually performed and must be serviceable. hence the individuals which performed them best, would tend to survive in greater numbers. the free use of the arms and hands, partly the cause and partly the result of man's erect position, appears to have led in an indirect manner to other modifications of structure. the early male forefathers of man were, as previously stated, probably furnished with great canine teeth; but as they gradually acquired the habit of using stones, clubs, or other weapons, for fighting with their enemies or rivals, they would use their jaws and teeth less and less. in this case, the jaws, together with the teeth, would become reduced in size, as we may feel almost sure from innumerable analogous cases. in a future chapter we shall meet with a closely parallel case, in the reduction or complete disappearance of the canine teeth in male ruminants, apparently in relation with the development of their horns; and in horses, in relation to their habit of fighting with their incisor teeth and hoofs. in the adult male anthropomorphous apes, as rutimeyer (77. 'die grenzen der thierwelt, eine betrachtung zu darwin's lehre,' 1868, s. 51.), and others, have insisted, it is the effect on the skull of the great development of the jaw-muscles that causes it to differ so greatly in many respects from that of man, and has given to these animals "a truly frightful physiognomy." therefore, as the jaws and teeth in man's progenitors gradually become reduced in size, the adult skull would have come to resemble more and more that of existing man. as we shall hereafter see, a great reduction of the canine teeth in the males would almost certainly affect the teeth of the females through inheritance. as the various mental faculties gradually developed themselves the brain would almost certainly become larger. no one, i presume, doubts that the large proportion which the size of man's brain bears to his body, compared to the same proportion in the gorilla or orang, is closely connected with his higher mental powers. we meet with closely analogous facts with insects, for in ants the cerebral ganglia are of extraordinary dimensions, and in all the hymenoptera these ganglia are many times larger than in the less intelligent orders, such as beetles. (78. dujardin, 'annales des sciences nat.' 3rd series, zoolog., tom. xiv. 1850, p. 203. see also mr. lowne, 'anatomy and phys. of the musca vomitoria,' 1870, p. 14. my son, mr. f. darwin, dissected for me the cerebral ganglia of the formica rufa.) on the other hand, no one supposes that the intellect of any two animals or of any two men can be accurately gauged by the cubic contents of their skulls. it is certain that there may be extraordinary mental activity with an extremely small absolute mass of nervous matter: thus the wonderfully diversified instincts, mental powers, and affections of ants are notorious, yet their cerebral ganglia are not so large as the quarter of a small pin's head. under this point of view, the brain of an ant is one of the most marvellous atoms of matter in the world, perhaps more so than the brain of a man. the belief that there exists in man some close relation between the size of the brain and the development of the intellectual faculties is supported by the comparison of the skulls of savage and civilised races, of ancient and modern people, and by the analogy of the whole vertebrate series. dr. j. barnard davis has proved (79. 'philosophical transactions,' 1869, p. 513.), by many careful measurements, that the mean internal capacity of the skull in europeans is 92.3 cubic inches; in americans 87.5; in asiatics 87.1; and in australians only 81.9 cubic inches. professor broca (80. 'les selections,' m. p. broca, 'revue d'anthropologies,' 1873; see also, as quoted in c. vogt's 'lectures on man,' engl. translat., 1864, pp. 88, 90. prichard, 'physical history of mankind,' vol. i. 1838, p. 305.) found that the nineteenth century skulls from graves in paris were larger than those from vaults of the twelfth century, in the proportion of 1484 to 1426; and that the increased size, as ascertained by measurements, was exclusively in the frontal part of the skull--the seat of the intellectual faculties. prichard is persuaded that the present inhabitants of britain have "much more capacious brain-cases" than the ancient inhabitants. nevertheless, it must be admitted that some skulls of very high antiquity, such as the famous one of neanderthal, are well developed and capacious. (81. in the interesting article just referred to, prof. broca has well remarked, that in civilised nations, the average capacity of the skull must be lowered by the preservation of a considerable number of individuals, weak in mind and body, who would have been promptly eliminated in the savage state. on the other hand, with savages, the average includes only the more capable individuals, who have been able to survive under extremely hard conditions of life. broca thus explains the otherwise inexplicable fact, that the mean capacity of the skull of the ancient troglodytes of lozere is greater than that of modern frenchmen.) with respect to the lower animals, m.e. lartet (82. 'comptes-rendus des sciences,' etc., june 1, 1868.), by comparing the crania of tertiary and recent mammals belonging to the same groups, has come to the remarkable conclusion that the brain is generally larger and the convolutions are more complex in the more recent forms. on the other hand, i have shewn (83. the 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. i. pp. 124-129.) that the brains of domestic rabbits are considerably reduced in bulk, in comparison with those of the wild rabbit or hare; and this may be attributed to their having been closely confined during many generations, so that they have exerted their intellect, instincts, senses and voluntary movements but little. the gradually increasing weight of the brain and skull in man must have influenced the development of the supporting spinal column, more especially whilst he was becoming erect. as this change of position was being brought about, the internal pressure of the brain will also have influenced the form of the skull; for many facts shew how easily the skull is thus affected. ethnologists believe that it is modified by the kind of cradle in which infants sleep. habitual spasms of the muscles, and a cicatrix from a severe burn, have permanently modified the facial bones. in young persons whose heads have become fixed either sideways or backwards, owing to disease, one of the two eyes has changed its position, and the shape of the skull has been altered apparently by the pressure of the brain in a new direction. (84. schaaffhausen gives from blumenbach and busch, the cases of the spasms and cicatrix, in 'anthropological review,' oct. 1868, p. 420. dr. jarrold ('anthropologia,' 1808, pp. 115, 116) adduces from camper and from his own observations, cases of the modification of the skull from the head being fixed in an unnatural position. he believes that in certain trades, such as that of a shoemaker, where the head is habitually held forward, the forehead becomes more rounded and prominent.) i have shewn that with long-eared rabbits even so trifling a cause as the lopping forward of one ear drags forward almost every bone of the skull on that side; so that the bones on the opposite side no longer strictly correspond. lastly, if any animal were to increase or diminish much in general size, without any change in its mental powers, or if the mental powers were to be much increased or diminished, without any great change in the size of the body, the shape of the skull would almost certainly be altered. i infer this from my observations on domestic rabbits, some kinds of which have become very much larger than the wild animal, whilst others have retained nearly the same size, but in both cases the brain has been much reduced relatively to the size of the body. now i was at first much surprised on finding that in all these rabbits the skull had become elongated or dolichocephalic; for instance, of two skulls of nearly equal breadth, the one from a wild rabbit and the other from a large domestic kind, the former was 3.15 and the latter 4.3 inches in length. (85. 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. i. p. 117, on the elongation of the skull; p. 119, on the effect of the lopping of one ear.) one of the most marked distinctions in different races of men is that the skull in some is elongated, and in others rounded; and here the explanation suggested by the case of the rabbits may hold good; for welcker finds that short "men incline more to brachycephaly, and tall men to dolichocephaly" (86. quoted by schaaffhausen, in 'anthropological review,' oct. 1868, p. 419.); and tall men may be compared with the larger and longer-bodied rabbits, all of which have elongated skulls or are dolichocephalic. from these several facts we can understand, to a certain extent, the means by which the great size and more or less rounded form of the skull have been acquired by man; and these are characters eminently distinctive of him in comparison with the lower animals. another most conspicuous difference between man and the lower animals is the nakedness of his skin. whales and porpoises (cetacea), dugongs (sirenia) and the hippopotamus are naked; and this may be advantageous to them for gliding through the water; nor would it be injurious to them from the loss of warmth, as the species, which inhabit the colder regions, are protected by a thick layer of blubber, serving the same purpose as the fur of seals and otters. elephants and rhinoceroses are almost hairless; and as certain extinct species, which formerly lived under an arctic climate, were covered with long wool or hair, it would almost appear as if the existing species of both genera had lost their hairy covering from exposure to heat. this appears the more probable, as the elephants in india which live on elevated and cool districts are more hairy (87. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 619.) than those on the lowlands. may we then infer that man became divested of hair from having aboriginally inhabited some tropical land? that the hair is chiefly retained in the male sex on the chest and face, and in both sexes at the junction of all four limbs with the trunk, favours this inference--on the assumption that the hair was lost before man became erect; for the parts which now retain most hair would then have been most protected from the heat of the sun. the crown of the head, however, offers a curious exception, for at all times it must have been one of the most exposed parts, yet it is thickly clothed with hair. the fact, however, that the other members of the order of primates, to which man belongs, although inhabiting various hot regions, are well clothed with hair, generally thickest on the upper surface (88. isidore geoffroy st.-hilaire remarks ('histoire nat. generale,' tom. ii. 1859, pp. 215-217) on the head of man being covered with long hair; also on the upper surfaces of monkeys and of other mammals being more thickly clothed than the lower surfaces. this has likewise been observed by various authors. prof. p. gervais ('histoire nat. des mammifères,' tom. i. 1854, p. 28), however, states that in the gorilla the hair is thinner on the back, where it is partly rubbed off, than on the lower surface.), is opposed to the supposition that man became naked through the action of the sun. mr. belt believes (89. the 'naturalist in nicaragua,' 1874, p. 209. as some confirmation of mr. belt's view, i may quote the following passage from sir w. denison ('varieties of vice-regal life,' vol. i. 1870, p. 440): "it is said to be a practice with the australians, when the vermin get troublesome, to singe themselves.") that within the tropics it is an advantage to man to be destitute of hair, as he is thus enabled to free himself of the multitude of ticks (acari) and other parasites, with which he is often infested, and which sometimes cause ulceration. but whether this evil is of sufficient magnitude to have led to the denudation of his body through natural selection, may be doubted, since none of the many quadrupeds inhabiting the tropics have, as far as i know, acquired any specialised means of relief. the view which seems to me the most probable is that man, or rather primarily woman, became divested of hair for ornamental purposes, as we shall see under sexual selection; and, according to this belief, it is not surprising that man should differ so greatly in hairiness from all other primates, for characters, gained through sexual selection, often differ to an extraordinary degree in closely related forms. according to a popular impression, the absence of a tail is eminently distinctive of man; but as those apes which come nearest to him are destitute of this organ, its disappearance does not relate exclusively to man. the tail often differs remarkably in length within the same genus: thus in some species of macacus it is longer than the whole body, and is formed of twenty-four vertebrae; in others it consists of a scarcely visible stump, containing only three or four vertebrae. in some kinds of baboons there are twenty-five, whilst in the mandrill there are ten very small stunted caudal vertebrae, or, according to cuvier (90. mr. st. george mivart, 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1865, pp. 562, 583. dr. j.e. gray, 'cat. brit. mus.: 'skeletons.' owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. ii. p. 517. isidore geoffroy, 'hist. nat. gen.' tom. ii. p. 244.), sometimes only five. the tail, whether it be long or short, almost always tapers towards the end; and this, i presume, results from the atrophy of the terminal muscles, together with their arteries and nerves, through disuse, leading to the atrophy of the terminal bones. but no explanation can at present be given of the great diversity which often occurs in its length. here, however, we are more specially concerned with the complete external disappearance of the tail. professor broca has recently shewn (91. 'revue d'anthropologie,' 1872; 'la constitution des vertèbres caudales.') that the tail in all quadrupeds consists of two portions, generally separated abruptly from each other; the basal portion consists of vertebrae, more or less perfectly channelled and furnished with apophyses like ordinary vertebrae; whereas those of the terminal portion are not channelled, are almost smooth, and scarcely resemble true vertebrae. a tail, though not externally visible, is really present in man and the anthropomorphous apes, and is constructed on exactly the same pattern in both. in the terminal portion the vertebrae, constituting the os coccyx, are quite rudimentary, being much reduced in size and number. in the basal portion, the vertebrae are likewise few, are united firmly together, and are arrested in development; but they have been rendered much broader and flatter than the corresponding vertebrae in the tails of other animals: they constitute what broca calls the accessory sacral vertebrae. these are of functional importance by supporting certain internal parts and in other ways; and their modification is directly connected with the erect or semi-erect attitude of man and the anthropomorphous apes. this conclusion is the more trustworthy, as broca formerly held a different view, which he has now abandoned. the modification, therefore, of the basal caudal vertebrae in man and the higher apes may have been effected, directly or indirectly, through natural selection. but what are we to say about the rudimentary and variable vertebrae of the terminal portion of the tail, forming the os coccyx? a notion which has often been, and will no doubt again be ridiculed, namely, that friction has had something to do with the disappearance of the external portion of the tail, is not so ridiculous as it at first appears. dr. anderson (92. 'proceedings zoological society,' 1872, p. 210.) states that the extremely short tail of macacus brunneus is formed of eleven vertebrae, including the imbedded basal ones. the extremity is tendinous and contains no vertebrae; this is succeeded by five rudimentary ones, so minute that together they are only one line and a half in length, and these are permanently bent to one side in the shape of a hook. the free part of the tail, only a little above an inch in length, includes only four more small vertebrae. this short tail is carried erect; but about a quarter of its total length is doubled on to itself to the left; and this terminal part, which includes the hook-like portion, serves "to fill up the interspace between the upper divergent portion of the callosities;" so that the animal sits on it, and thus renders it rough and callous. dr. anderson thus sums up his observations: "these facts seem to me to have only one explanation; this tail, from its short size, is in the monkey's way when it sits down, and frequently becomes placed under the animal while it is in this attitude; and from the circumstance that it does not extend beyond the extremity of the ischial tuberosities, it seems as if the tail originally had been bent round by the will of the animal, into the interspace between the callosities, to escape being pressed between them and the ground, and that in time the curvature became permanent, fitting in of itself when the organ happens to be sat upon." under these circumstances it is not surprising that the surface of the tail should have been roughened and rendered callous, and dr. murie (93. 'proceedings zoological society,' 1872, p. 786.), who carefully observed this species in the zoological gardens, as well as three other closely allied forms with slightly longer tails, says that when the animal sits down, the tail "is necessarily thrust to one side of the buttocks; and whether long or short its root is consequently liable to be rubbed or chafed." as we now have evidence that mutilations occasionally produce an inherited effect (94. i allude to dr. brown- sequard's observations on the transmitted effect of an operation causing epilepsy in guinea-pigs, and likewise more recently on the analogous effects of cutting the sympathetic nerve in the neck. i shall hereafter have occasion to refer to mr. salvin's interesting case of the apparently inherited effects of mot-mots biting off the barbs of their own tail- feathers. see also on the general subject 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. pp. 22-24.), it is not very improbable that in short-tailed monkeys, the projecting part of the tail, being functionally useless, should after many generations have become rudimentary and distorted, from being continually rubbed and chafed. we see the projecting part in this condition in the macacus brunneus, and absolutely aborted in the m. ecaudatus and in several of the higher apes. finally, then, as far as we can judge, the tail has disappeared in man and the anthropomorphous apes, owing to the terminal portion having been injured by friction during a long lapse of time; the basal and embedded portion having been reduced and modified, so as to become suitable to the erect or semi- erect position. i have now endeavoured to shew that some of the most distinctive characters of man have in all probability been acquired, either directly, or more commonly indirectly, through natural selection. we should bear in mind that modifications in structure or constitution which do not serve to adapt an organism to its habits of life, to the food which it consumes, or passively to the surrounding conditions, cannot have been thus acquired. we must not, however, be too confident in deciding what modifications are of service to each being: we should remember how little we know about the use of many parts, or what changes in the blood or tissues may serve to fit an organism for a new climate or new kinds of food. nor must we forget the principle of correlation, by which, as isidore geoffroy has shewn in the case of man, many strange deviations of structure are tied together. independently of correlation, a change in one part often leads, through the increased or decreased use of other parts, to other changes of a quite unexpected nature. it is also well to reflect on such facts, as the wonderful growth of galls on plants caused by the poison of an insect, and on the remarkable changes of colour in the plumage of parrots when fed on certain fishes, or inoculated with the poison of toads (95. the 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. pp. 280, 282.); for we can thus see that the fluids of the system, if altered for some special purpose, might induce other changes. we should especially bear in mind that modifications acquired and continually used during past ages for some useful purpose, would probably become firmly fixed, and might be long inherited. thus a large yet undefined extension may safely be given to the direct and indirect results of natural selection; but i now admit, after reading the essay by nageli on plants, and the remarks by various authors with respect to animals, more especially those recently made by professor broca, that in the earlier editions of my 'origin of species' i perhaps attributed too much to the action of natural selection or the survival of the fittest. i have altered the fifth edition of the 'origin' so as to confine my remarks to adaptive changes of structure; but i am convinced, from the light gained during even the last few years, that very many structures which now appear to us useless, will hereafter be proved to be useful, and will therefore come within the range of natural selection. nevertheless, i did not formerly consider sufficiently the existence of structures, which, as far as we can at present judge, are neither beneficial nor injurious; and this i believe to be one of the greatest oversights as yet detected in my work. i may be permitted to say, as some excuse, that i had two distinct objects in view; firstly, to shew that species had not been separately created, and secondly, that natural selection had been the chief agent of change, though largely aided by the inherited effects of habit, and slightly by the direct action of the surrounding conditions. i was not, however, able to annul the influence of my former belief, then almost universal, that each species had been purposely created; and this led to my tacit assumption that every detail of structure, excepting rudiments, was of some special, though unrecognised, service. any one with this assumption in his mind would naturally extend too far the action of natural selection, either during past or present times. some of those who admit the principle of evolution, but reject natural selection, seem to forget, when criticising my book, that i had the above two objects in view; hence if i have erred in giving to natural selection great power, which i am very far from admitting, or in having exaggerated its power, which is in itself probable, i have at least, as i hope, done good service in aiding to overthrow the dogma of separate creations. it is, as i can now see, probable that all organic beings, including man, possess peculiarities of structure, which neither are now, nor were formerly of any service to them, and which, therefore, are of no physiological importance. we know not what produces the numberless slight differences between the individuals of each species, for reversion only carries the problem a few steps backwards, but each peculiarity must have had its efficient cause. if these causes, whatever they may be, were to act more uniformly and energetically during a lengthened period (and against this no reason can be assigned), the result would probably be not a mere slight individual difference, but a well-marked and constant modification, though one of no physiological importance. changed structures, which are in no way beneficial, cannot be kept uniform through natural selection, though the injurious will be thus eliminated. uniformity of character would, however, naturally follow from the assumed uniformity of the exciting causes, and likewise from the free intercrossing of many individuals. during successive periods, the same organism might in this manner acquire successive modifications, which would be transmitted in a nearly uniform state as long as the exciting causes remained the same and there was free intercrossing. with respect to the exciting causes we can only say, as when speaking of so-called spontaneous variations, that they relate much more closely to the constitution of the varying organism, than to the nature of the conditions to which it has been subjected. conclusion. in this chapter we have seen that as man at the present day is liable, like every other animal, to multiform individual differences or slight variations, so no doubt were the early progenitors of man; the variations being formerly induced by the same general causes, and governed by the same general and complex laws as at present. as all animals tend to multiply beyond their means of subsistence, so it must have been with the progenitors of man; and this would inevitably lead to a struggle for existence and to natural selection. the latter process would be greatly aided by the inherited effects of the increased use of parts, and these two processes would incessantly react on each other. it appears, also, as we shall hereafter see, that various unimportant characters have been acquired by man through sexual selection. an unexplained residuum of change must be left to the assumed uniform action of those unknown agencies, which occasionally induce strongly marked and abrupt deviations of structure in our domestic productions. judging from the habits of savages and of the greater number of the quadrumana, primeval men, and even their ape-like progenitors, probably lived in society. with strictly social animals, natural selection sometimes acts on the individual, through the preservation of variations which are beneficial to the community. a community which includes a large number of well-endowed individuals increases in number, and is victorious over other less favoured ones; even although each separate member gains no advantage over the others of the same community. associated insects have thus acquired many remarkable structures, which are of little or no service to the individual, such as the pollen-collecting apparatus, or the sting of the worker-bee, or the great jaws of soldier-ants. with the higher social animals, i am not aware that any structure has been modified solely for the good of the community, though some are of secondary service to it. for instance, the horns of ruminants and the great canine teeth of baboons appear to have been acquired by the males as weapons for sexual strife, but they are used in defence of the herd or troop. in regard to certain mental powers the case, as we shall see in the fifth chapter, is wholly different; for these faculties have been chiefly, or even exclusively, gained for the benefit of the community, and the individuals thereof have at the same time gained an advantage indirectly. it has often been objected to such views as the foregoing, that man is one of the most helpless and defenceless creatures in the world; and that during his early and less well-developed condition, he would have been still more helpless. the duke of argyll, for instance, insists (96. 'primeval man,' 1869, p. 66.) that "the human frame has diverged from the structure of brutes, in the direction of greater physical helplessness and weakness. that is to say, it is a divergence which of all others it is most impossible to ascribe to mere natural selection." he adduces the naked and unprotected state of the body, the absence of great teeth or claws for defence, the small strength and speed of man, and his slight power of discovering food or of avoiding danger by smell. to these deficiencies there might be added one still more serious, namely, that he cannot climb quickly, and so escape from enemies. the loss of hair would not have been a great injury to the inhabitants of a warm country. for we know that the unclothed fuegians can exist under a wretched climate. when we compare the defenceless state of man with that of apes, we must remember that the great canine teeth with which the latter are provided, are possessed in their full development by the males alone, and are chiefly used by them for fighting with their rivals; yet the females, which are not thus provided, manage to survive. in regard to bodily size or strength, we do not know whether man is descended from some small species, like the chimpanzee, or from one as powerful as the gorilla; and, therefore, we cannot say whether man has become larger and stronger, or smaller and weaker, than his ancestors. we should, however, bear in mind that an animal possessing great size, strength, and ferocity, and which, like the gorilla, could defend itself from all enemies, would not perhaps have become social: and this would most effectually have checked the acquirement of the higher mental qualities, such as sympathy and the love of his fellows. hence it might have been an immense advantage to man to have sprung from some comparatively weak creature. the small strength and speed of man, his want of natural weapons, etc., are more than counterbalanced, firstly, by his intellectual powers, through which he has formed for himself weapons, tools, etc., though still remaining in a barbarous state, and, secondly, by his social qualities which lead him to give and receive aid from his fellow-men. no country in the world abounds in a greater degree with dangerous beasts than southern africa; no country presents more fearful physical hardships than the arctic regions; yet one of the puniest of races, that of the bushmen, maintains itself in southern africa, as do the dwarfed esquimaux in the arctic regions. the ancestors of man were, no doubt, inferior in intellect, and probably in social disposition, to the lowest existing savages; but it is quite conceivable that they might have existed, or even flourished, if they had advanced in intellect, whilst gradually losing their brute-like powers, such as that of climbing trees, etc. but these ancestors would not have been exposed to any special danger, even if far more helpless and defenceless than any existing savages, had they inhabited some warm continent or large island, such as australia, new guinea, or borneo, which is now the home of the orang. and natural selection arising from the competition of tribe with tribe, in some such large area as one of these, together with the inherited effects of habit, would, under favourable conditions, have sufficed to raise man to his present high position in the organic scale. chapter iii. comparison of the mental powers of man and the lower animals. the difference in mental power between the highest ape and the lowest savage, immense--certain instincts in common--the emotions--curiosity-- imitation--attention--memory--imagination--reason--progressive improvement --tools and weapons used by animals--abstraction, self-consciousness-- language--sense of beauty--belief in god, spiritual agencies, superstitions. we have seen in the last two chapters that man bears in his bodily structure clear traces of his descent from some lower form; but it may be urged that, as man differs so greatly in his mental power from all other animals, there must be some error in this conclusion. no doubt the difference in this respect is enormous, even if we compare the mind of one of the lowest savages, who has no words to express any number higher than four, and who uses hardly any abstract terms for common objects or for the affections (1. see the evidence on those points, as given by lubbock, 'prehistoric times,' p. 354, etc.), with that of the most highly organised ape. the difference would, no doubt, still remain immense, even if one of the higher apes had been improved or civilised as much as a dog has been in comparison with its parent-form, the wolf or jackal. the fuegians rank amongst the lowest barbarians; but i was continually struck with surprise how closely the three natives on board h.m.s. "beagle," who had lived some years in england, and could talk a little english, resembled us in disposition and in most of our mental faculties. if no organic being excepting man had possessed any mental power, or if his powers had been of a wholly different nature from those of the lower animals, then we should never have been able to convince ourselves that our high faculties had been gradually developed. but it can be shewn that there is no fundamental difference of this kind. we must also admit that there is a much wider interval in mental power between one of the lowest fishes, as a lamprey or lancelet, and one of the higher apes, than between an ape and man; yet this interval is filled up by numberless gradations. nor is the difference slight in moral disposition between a barbarian, such as the man described by the old navigator byron, who dashed his child on the rocks for dropping a basket of sea-urchins, and a howard or clarkson; and in intellect, between a savage who uses hardly any abstract terms, and a newton or shakspeare. differences of this kind between the highest men of the highest races and the lowest savages, are connected by the finest gradations. therefore it is possible that they might pass and be developed into each other. my object in this chapter is to shew that there is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties. each division of the subject might have been extended into a separate essay, but must here be treated briefly. as no classification of the mental powers has been universally accepted, i shall arrange my remarks in the order most convenient for my purpose; and will select those facts which have struck me most, with the hope that they may produce some effect on the reader. with respect to animals very low in the scale, i shall give some additional facts under sexual selection, shewing that their mental powers are much higher than might have been expected. the variability of the faculties in the individuals of the same species is an important point for us, and some few illustrations will here be given. but it would be superfluous to enter into many details on this head, for i have found on frequent enquiry, that it is the unanimous opinion of all those who have long attended to animals of many kinds, including birds, that the individuals differ greatly in every mental characteristic. in what manner the mental powers were first developed in the lowest organisms, is as hopeless an enquiry as how life itself first originated. these are problems for the distant future, if they are ever to be solved by man. as man possesses the same senses as the lower animals, his fundamental intuitions must be the same. man has also some few instincts in common, as that of self-preservation, sexual love, the love of the mother for her new- born offspring, the desire possessed by the latter to suck, and so forth. but man, perhaps, has somewhat fewer instincts than those possessed by the animals which come next to him in the series. the orang in the eastern islands, and the chimpanzee in africa, build platforms on which they sleep; and, as both species follow the same habit, it might be argued that this was due to instinct, but we cannot feel sure that it is not the result of both animals having similar wants, and possessing similar powers of reasoning. these apes, as we may assume, avoid the many poisonous fruits of the tropics, and man has no such knowledge: but as our domestic animals, when taken to foreign lands, and when first turned out in the spring, often eat poisonous herbs, which they afterwards avoid, we cannot feel sure that the apes do not learn from their own experience or from that of their parents what fruits to select. it is, however, certain, as we shall presently see, that apes have an instinctive dread of serpents, and probably of other dangerous animals. the fewness and the comparative simplicity of the instincts in the higher animals are remarkable in contrast with those of the lower animals. cuvier maintained that instinct and intelligence stand in an inverse ratio to each other; and some have thought that the intellectual faculties of the higher animals have been gradually developed from their instincts. but pouchet, in an interesting essay (2. 'l'instinct chez les insectes,' 'revue des deux mondes,' feb. 1870, p. 690.), has shewn that no such inverse ratio really exists. those insects which possess the most wonderful instincts are certainly the most intelligent. in the vertebrate series, the least intelligent members, namely fishes and amphibians, do not possess complex instincts; and amongst mammals the animal most remarkable for its instincts, namely the beaver, is highly intelligent, as will be admitted by every one who has read mr. morgan's excellent work. (3. 'the american beaver and his works,' 1868.) although the first dawnings of intelligence, according to mr. herbert spencer (4. 'the principles of psychology,' 2nd edit., 1870, pp. 418- 443.), have been developed through the multiplication and co-ordination of reflex actions, and although many of the simpler instincts graduate into reflex actions, and can hardly be distinguished from them, as in the case of young animals sucking, yet the more complex instincts seem to have originated independently of intelligence. i am, however, very far from wishing to deny that instinctive actions may lose their fixed and untaught character, and be replaced by others performed by the aid of the free will. on the other hand, some intelligent actions, after being performed during several generations, become converted into instincts and are inherited, as when birds on oceanic islands learn to avoid man. these actions may then be said to be degraded in character, for they are no longer performed through reason or from experience. but the greater number of the more complex instincts appear to have been gained in a wholly different manner, through the natural selection of variations of simpler instinctive actions. such variations appear to arise from the same unknown causes acting on the cerebral organisation, which induce slight variations or individual differences in other parts of the body; and these variations, owing to our ignorance, are often said to arise spontaneously. we can, i think, come to no other conclusion with respect to the origin of the more complex instincts, when we reflect on the marvellous instincts of sterile worker- ants and bees, which leave no offspring to inherit the effects of experience and of modified habits. although, as we learn from the above-mentioned insects and the beaver, a high degree of intelligence is certainly compatible with complex instincts, and although actions, at first learnt voluntarily can soon through habit be performed with the quickness and certainty of a reflex action, yet it is not improbable that there is a certain amount of interference between the development of free intelligence and of instinct,--which latter implies some inherited modification of the brain. little is known about the functions of the brain, but we can perceive that as the intellectual powers become highly developed, the various parts of the brain must be connected by very intricate channels of the freest intercommunication; and as a consequence each separate part would perhaps tend to be less well fitted to answer to particular sensations or associations in a definite and inherited--that is instinctive--manner. there seems even to exist some relation between a low degree of intelligence and a strong tendency to the formation of fixed, though not inherited habits; for as a sagacious physician remarked to me, persons who are slightly imbecile tend to act in everything by routine or habit; and they are rendered much happier if this is encouraged. i have thought this digression worth giving, because we may easily underrate the mental powers of the higher animals, and especially of man, when we compare their actions founded on the memory of past events, on foresight, reason, and imagination, with exactly similar actions instinctively performed by the lower animals; in this latter case the capacity of performing such actions has been gained, step by step, through the variability of the mental organs and natural selection, without any conscious intelligence on the part of the animal during each successive generation. no doubt, as mr. wallace has argued (5. 'contributions to the theory of natural selection,' 1870, p. 212.), much of the intelligent work done by man is due to imitation and not to reason; but there is this great difference between his actions and many of those performed by the lower animals, namely, that man cannot, on his first trial, make, for instance, a stone hatchet or a canoe, through his power of imitation. he has to learn his work by practice; a beaver, on the other hand, can make its dam or canal, and a bird its nest, as well, or nearly as well, and a spider its wonderful web, quite as well (6. for the evidence on this head, see mr. j. traherne moggridge's most interesting work, 'harvesting ants and trap-door spiders,' 1873, pp. 126, 128.), the first time it tries as when old and experienced. to return to our immediate subject: the lower animals, like man, manifestly feel pleasure and pain, happiness and misery. happiness is never better exhibited than by young animals, such as puppies, kittens, lambs, etc., when playing together, like our own children. even insects play together, as has been described by that excellent observer, p. huber (7. 'recherches sur les moeurs des fourmis,' 1810, p. 173.), who saw ants chasing and pretending to bite each other, like so many puppies. the fact that the lower animals are excited by the same emotions as ourselves is so well established, that it will not be necessary to weary the reader by many details. terror acts in the same manner on them as on us, causing the muscles to tremble, the heart to palpitate, the sphincters to be relaxed, and the hair to stand on end. suspicion, the offspring of fear, is eminently characteristic of most wild animals. it is, i think, impossible to read the account given by sir e. tennent, of the behaviour of the female elephants, used as decoys, without admitting that they intentionally practise deceit, and well know what they are about. courage and timidity are extremely variable qualities in the individuals of the same species, as is plainly seen in our dogs. some dogs and horses are ill-tempered, and easily turn sulky; others are good-tempered; and these qualities are certainly inherited. every one knows how liable animals are to furious rage, and how plainly they shew it. many, and probably true, anecdotes have been published on the long-delayed and artful revenge of various animals. the accurate rengger, and brehm (8. all the following statements, given on the authority of these two naturalists, are taken from rengger's 'naturgesch. der säugethiere von paraguay,' 1830, s. 41-57, and from brehm's 'thierleben,' b. i. s. 10-87.) state that the american and african monkeys which they kept tame, certainly revenged themselves. sir andrew smith, a zoologist whose scrupulous accuracy was known to many persons, told me the following story of which he was himself an eye- witness; at the cape of good hope an officer had often plagued a certain baboon, and the animal, seeing him approaching one sunday for parade, poured water into a hole and hastily made some thick mud, which he skilfully dashed over the officer as he passed by, to the amusement of many bystanders. for long afterwards the baboon rejoiced and triumphed whenever he saw his victim. the love of a dog for his master is notorious; as an old writer quaintly says (9. quoted by dr. lauder lindsay, in his 'physiology of mind in the lower animals,' 'journal of mental science,' april 1871, p. 38.), "a dog is the only thing on this earth that luvs you more than he luvs himself." in the agony of death a dog has been known to caress his master, and every one has heard of the dog suffering under vivisection, who licked the hand of the operator; this man, unless the operation was fully justified by an increase of our knowledge, or unless he had a heart of stone, must have felt remorse to the last hour of his life. as whewell (10. 'bridgewater treatise,' p. 263.) has well asked, "who that reads the touching instances of maternal affection, related so often of the women of all nations, and of the females of all animals, can doubt that the principle of action is the same in the two cases?" we see maternal affection exhibited in the most trifling details; thus rengger observed an american monkey (a cebus) carefully driving away the flies which plagued her infant; and duvaucel saw a hylobates washing the faces of her young ones in a stream. so intense is the grief of female monkeys for the loss of their young, that it invariably caused the death of certain kinds kept under confinement by brehm in n. africa. orphan monkeys were always adopted and carefully guarded by the other monkeys, both males and females. one female baboon had so capacious a heart that she not only adopted young monkeys of other species, but stole young dogs and cats, which she continually carried about. her kindness, however, did not go so far as to share her food with her adopted offspring, at which brehm was surprised, as his monkeys always divided everything quite fairly with their own young ones. an adopted kitten scratched this affectionate baboon, who certainly had a fine intellect, for she was much astonished at being scratched, and immediately examined the kitten's feet, and without more ado bit off the claws. (11. a critic, without any grounds ('quarterly review,' july 1871, p. 72), disputes the possibility of this act as described by brehm, for the sake of discrediting my work. therefore i tried, and found that i could readily seize with my own teeth the sharp little claws of a kitten nearly five weeks old.) in the zoological gardens, i heard from the keeper that an old baboon (c. chacma) had adopted a rhesus monkey; but when a young drill and mandrill were placed in the cage, she seemed to perceive that these monkeys, though distinct species, were her nearer relatives, for she at once rejected the rhesus and adopted both of them. the young rhesus, as i saw, was greatly discontented at being thus rejected, and it would, like a naughty child, annoy and attack the young drill and mandrill whenever it could do so with safety; this conduct exciting great indignation in the old baboon. monkeys will also, according to brehm, defend their master when attacked by any one, as well as dogs to whom they are attached, from the attacks of other dogs. but we here trench on the subjects of sympathy and fidelity, to which i shall recur. some of brehm's monkeys took much delight in teasing a certain old dog whom they disliked, as well as other animals, in various ingenious ways. most of the more complex emotions are common to the higher animals and ourselves. every one has seen how jealous a dog is of his master's affection, if lavished on any other creature; and i have observed the same fact with monkeys. this shews that animals not only love, but have desire to be loved. animals manifestly feel emulation. they love approbation or praise; and a dog carrying a basket for his master exhibits in a high degree self-complacency or pride. there can, i think, be no doubt that a dog feels shame, as distinct from fear, and something very like modesty when begging too often for food. a great dog scorns the snarling of a little dog, and this may be called magnanimity. several observers have stated that monkeys certainly dislike being laughed at; and they sometimes invent imaginary offences. in the zoological gardens i saw a baboon who always got into a furious rage when his keeper took out a letter or book and read it aloud to him; and his rage was so violent that, as i witnessed on one occasion, he bit his own leg till the blood flowed. dogs shew what may be fairly called a sense of humour, as distinct from mere play; if a bit of stick or other such object be thrown to one, he will often carry it away for a short distance; and then squatting down with it on the ground close before him, will wait until his master comes quite close to take it away. the dog will then seize it and rush away in triumph, repeating the same manoeuvre, and evidently enjoying the practical joke. we will now turn to the more intellectual emotions and faculties, which are very important, as forming the basis for the development of the higher mental powers. animals manifestly enjoy excitement, and suffer from ennui, as may be seen with dogs, and, according to rengger, with monkeys. all animals feel wonder, and many exhibit curiosity. they sometimes suffer from this latter quality, as when the hunter plays antics and thus attracts them; i have witnessed this with deer, and so it is with the wary chamois, and with some kinds of wild-ducks. brehm gives a curious account of the instinctive dread, which his monkeys exhibited, for snakes; but their curiosity was so great that they could not desist from occasionally satiating their horror in a most human fashion, by lifting up the lid of the box in which the snakes were kept. i was so much surprised at his account, that i took a stuffed and coiled-up snake into the monkey-house at the zoological gardens, and the excitement thus caused was one of the most curious spectacles which i ever beheld. three species of cercopithecus were the most alarmed; they dashed about their cages, and uttered sharp signal cries of danger, which were understood by the other monkeys. a few young monkeys and one old anubis baboon alone took no notice of the snake. i then placed the stuffed specimen on the ground in one of the larger compartments. after a time all the monkeys collected round it in a large circle, and staring intently, presented a most ludicrous appearance. they became extremely nervous; so that when a wooden ball, with which they were familiar as a plaything, was accidentally moved in the straw, under which it was partly hidden, they all instantly started away. these monkeys behaved very differently when a dead fish, a mouse (12. i have given a short account of their behaviour on this occasion in my 'expression of the emotions in man and animals,' p. 43.), a living turtle, and other new objects were placed in their cages; for though at first frightened, they soon approached, handled and examined them. i then placed a live snake in a paper bag, with the mouth loosely closed, in one of the larger compartments. one of the monkeys immediately approached, cautiously opened the bag a little, peeped in, and instantly dashed away. then i witnessed what brehm has described, for monkey after monkey, with head raised high and turned on one side, could not resist taking a momentary peep into the upright bag, at the dreadful object lying quietly at the bottom. it would almost appear as if monkeys had some notion of zoological affinities, for those kept by brehm exhibited a strange, though mistaken, instinctive dread of innocent lizards and frogs. an orang, also, has been known to be much alarmed at the first sight of a turtle. (13. w.c.l. martin, 'natural history of mammalia,' 1841, p. 405.) the principle of imitation is strong in man, and especially, as i have myself observed, with savages. in certain morbid states of the brain this tendency is exaggerated to an extraordinary degree: some hemiplegic patients and others, at the commencement of inflammatory softening of the brain, unconsciously imitate every word which is uttered, whether in their own or in a foreign language, and every gesture or action which is performed near them. (14. dr. bateman, 'on aphasia,' 1870, p. 110.) desor (15. quoted by vogt, 'mémoire sur les microcephales,' 1867, p. 168.) has remarked that no animal voluntarily imitates an action performed by man, until in the ascending scale we come to monkeys, which are well known to be ridiculous mockers. animals, however, sometimes imitate each other's actions: thus two species of wolves, which had been reared by dogs, learned to bark, as does sometimes the jackal (16. the 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. i. p. 27.), but whether this can be called voluntary imitation is another question. birds imitate the songs of their parents, and sometimes of other birds; and parrots are notorious imitators of any sound which they often hear. dureau de la malle gives an account (17. 'annales des sciences nat.' (1st series), tom. xxii. p. 397.) of a dog reared by a cat, who learnt to imitate the well-known action of a cat licking her paws, and thus washing her ears and face; this was also witnessed by the celebrated naturalist audouin. i have received several confirmatory accounts; in one of these, a dog had not been suckled by a cat, but had been brought up with one, together with kittens, and had thus acquired the above habit, which he ever afterwards practised during his life of thirteen years. dureau de la malle's dog likewise learnt from the kittens to play with a ball by rolling it about with his fore paws, and springing on it. a correspondent assures me that a cat in his house used to put her paws into jugs of milk having too narrow a mouth for her head. a kitten of this cat soon learned the same trick, and practised it ever afterwards, whenever there was an opportunity. the parents of many animals, trusting to the principle of imitation in their young, and more especially to their instinctive or inherited tendencies, may be said to educate them. we see this when a cat brings a live mouse to her kittens; and dureau de la malle has given a curious account (in the paper above quoted) of his observations on hawks which taught their young dexterity, as well as judgment of distances, by first dropping through the air dead mice and sparrows, which the young generally failed to catch, and then bringing them live birds and letting them loose. hardly any faculty is more important for the intellectual progress of man than attention. animals clearly manifest this power, as when a cat watches by a hole and prepares to spring on its prey. wild animals sometimes become so absorbed when thus engaged, that they may be easily approached. mr. bartlett has given me a curious proof how variable this faculty is in monkeys. a man who trains monkeys to act in plays, used to purchase common kinds from the zoological society at the price of five pounds for each; but he offered to give double the price, if he might keep three or four of them for a few days, in order to select one. when asked how he could possibly learn so soon, whether a particular monkey would turn out a good actor, he answered that it all depended on their power of attention. if when he was talking and explaining anything to a monkey, its attention was easily distracted, as by a fly on the wall or other trifling object, the case was hopeless. if he tried by punishment to make an inattentive monkey act, it turned sulky. on the other hand, a monkey which carefully attended to him could always be trained. it is almost superfluous to state that animals have excellent memories for persons and places. a baboon at the cape of good hope, as i have been informed by sir andrew smith, recognised him with joy after an absence of nine months. i had a dog who was savage and averse to all strangers, and i purposely tried his memory after an absence of five years and two days. i went near the stable where he lived, and shouted to him in my old manner; he shewed no joy, but instantly followed me out walking, and obeyed me, exactly as if i had parted with him only half an hour before. a train of old associations, dormant during five years, had thus been instantaneously awakened in his mind. even ants, as p. huber (18. 'les moeurs des fourmis,' 1810, p. 150.) has clearly shewn, recognised their fellow-ants belonging to the same community after a separation of four months. animals can certainly by some means judge of the intervals of time between recurrent events. the imagination is one of the highest prerogatives of man. by this faculty he unites former images and ideas, independently of the will, and thus creates brilliant and novel results. a poet, as jean paul richter remarks (19. quoted in dr. maudsley's 'physiology and pathology of mind,' 1868, pp. 19, 220.), "who must reflect whether he shall make a character say yes or no--to the devil with him; he is only a stupid corpse." dreaming gives us the best notion of this power; as jean paul again says, "the dream is an involuntary art of poetry." the value of the products of our imagination depends of course on the number, accuracy, and clearness of our impressions, on our judgment and taste in selecting or rejecting the involuntary combinations, and to a certain extent on our power of voluntarily combining them. as dogs, cats, horses, and probably all the higher animals, even birds (20. dr. jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. i. 1862, p. xxi. houzeau says that his parokeets and canary-birds dreamt: 'etudes sur les facultes mentales des animaux,' tom. ii. p. 136.) have vivid dreams, and this is shewn by their movements and the sounds uttered, we must admit that they possess some power of imagination. there must be something special, which causes dogs to howl in the night, and especially during moonlight, in that remarkable and melancholy manner called baying. all dogs do not do so; and, according to houzeau (21. ibid. 1872, tom. ii. p. 181.), they do not then look at the moon, but at some fixed point near the horizon. houzeau thinks that their imaginations are disturbed by the vague outlines of the surrounding objects, and conjure up before them fantastic images: if this be so, their feelings may almost be called superstitious. of all the faculties of the human mind, it will, i presume, be admitted that reason stands at the summit. only a few persons now dispute that animals possess some power of reasoning. animals may constantly be seen to pause, deliberate, and resolve. it is a significant fact, that the more the habits of any particular animal are studied by a naturalist, the more he attributes to reason and the less to unlearnt instincts. (22. mr. l.h. morgan's work on 'the american beaver,' 1868, offers a good illustration of this remark. i cannot help thinking, however, that he goes too far in underrating the power of instinct.) in future chapters we shall see that some animals extremely low in the scale apparently display a certain amount of reason. no doubt it is often difficult to distinguish between the power of reason and that of instinct. for instance, dr. hayes, in his work on 'the open polar sea,' repeatedly remarks that his dogs, instead of continuing to draw the sledges in a compact body, diverged and separated when they came to thin ice, so that their weight might be more evenly distributed. this was often the first warning which the travellers received that the ice was becoming thin and dangerous. now, did the dogs act thus from the experience of each individual, or from the example of the older and wiser dogs, or from an inherited habit, that is from instinct? this instinct, may possibly have arisen since the time, long ago, when dogs were first employed by the natives in drawing their sledges; or the arctic wolves, the parent-stock of the esquimaux dog, may have acquired an instinct impelling them not to attack their prey in a close pack, when on thin ice. we can only judge by the circumstances under which actions are performed, whether they are due to instinct, or to reason, or to the mere association of ideas: this latter principle, however, is intimately connected with reason. a curious case has been given by prof. mobius (23. 'die bewegungen der thiere,' etc., 1873, p. 11.), of a pike, separated by a plate of glass from an adjoining aquarium stocked with fish, and who often dashed himself with such violence against the glass in trying to catch the other fishes, that he was sometimes completely stunned. the pike went on thus for three months, but at last learnt caution, and ceased to do so. the plate of glass was then removed, but the pike would not attack these particular fishes, though he would devour others which were afterwards introduced; so strongly was the idea of a violent shock associated in his feeble mind with the attempt on his former neighbours. if a savage, who had never seen a large plate-glass window, were to dash himself even once against it, he would for a long time afterwards associate a shock with a window-frame; but very differently from the pike, he would probably reflect on the nature of the impediment, and be cautious under analogous circumstances. now with monkeys, as we shall presently see, a painful or merely a disagreeable impression, from an action once performed, is sometimes sufficient to prevent the animal from repeating it. if we attribute this difference between the monkey and the pike solely to the association of ideas being so much stronger and more persistent in the one than the other, though the pike often received much the more severe injury, can we maintain in the case of man that a similar difference implies the possession of a fundamentally different mind? houzeau relates (24. 'études sur les facultés mentales des animaux,' 1872, tom. ii. p. 265.) that, whilst crossing a wide and arid plain in texas, his two dogs suffered greatly from thirst, and that between thirty and forty times they rushed down the hollows to search for water. these hollows were not valleys, and there were no trees in them, or any other difference in the vegetation, and as they were absolutely dry there could have been no smell of damp earth. the dogs behaved as if they knew that a dip in the ground offered them the best chance of finding water, and houzeau has often witnessed the same behaviour in other animals. i have seen, as i daresay have others, that when a small object is thrown on the ground beyond the reach of one of the elephants in the zoological gardens, he blows through his trunk on the ground beyond the object, so that the current reflected on all sides may drive the object within his reach. again a well-known ethnologist, mr. westropp, informs me that he observed in vienna a bear deliberately making with his paw a current in some water, which was close to the bars of his cage, so as to draw a piece of floating bread within his reach. these actions of the elephant and bear can hardly be attributed to instinct or inherited habit, as they would be of little use to an animal in a state of nature. now, what is the difference between such actions, when performed by an uncultivated man, and by one of the higher animals? the savage and the dog have often found water at a low level, and the coincidence under such circumstances has become associated in their minds. a cultivated man would perhaps make some general proposition on the subject; but from all that we know of savages it is extremely doubtful whether they would do so, and a dog certainly would not. but a savage, as well as a dog, would search in the same way, though frequently disappointed; and in both it seems to be equally an act of reason, whether or not any general proposition on the subject is consciously placed before the mind. (25. prof. huxley has analysed with admirable clearness the mental steps by which a man, as well as a dog, arrives at a conclusion in a case analogous to that given in my text. see his article, 'mr. darwin's critics,' in the 'contemporary review,' nov. 1871, p. 462, and in his 'critiques and essays,' 1873, p. 279.) the same would apply to the elephant and the bear making currents in the air or water. the savage would certainly neither know nor care by what law the desired movements were effected; yet his act would be guided by a rude process of reasoning, as surely as would a philosopher in his longest chain of deductions. there would no doubt be this difference between him and one of the higher animals, that he would take notice of much slighter circumstances and conditions, and would observe any connection between them after much less experience, and this would be of paramount importance. i kept a daily record of the actions of one of my infants, and when he was about eleven months old, and before he could speak a single word, i was continually struck with the greater quickness, with which all sorts of objects and sounds were associated together in his mind, compared with that of the most intelligent dogs i ever knew. but the higher animals differ in exactly the same way in this power of association from those low in the scale, such as the pike, as well as in that of drawing inferences and of observation. the promptings of reason, after very short experience, are well shewn by the following actions of american monkeys, which stand low in their order. rengger, a most careful observer, states that when he first gave eggs to his monkeys in paraguay, they smashed them, and thus lost much of their contents; afterwards they gently hit one end against some hard body, and picked off the bits of shell with their fingers. after cutting themselves only once with any sharp tool, they would not touch it again, or would handle it with the greatest caution. lumps of sugar were often given them wrapped up in paper; and rengger sometimes put a live wasp in the paper, so that in hastily unfolding it they got stung; after this had once happened, they always first held the packet to their ears to detect any movement within. (26. mr. belt, in his most interesting work, 'the naturalist in nicaragua,' 1874, (p. 119), likewise describes various actions of a tamed cebus, which, i think, clearly shew that this animal possessed some reasoning power.) the following cases relate to dogs. mr. colquhoun (27. 'the moor and the loch,' p. 45. col. hutchinson on 'dog breaking,' 1850, p. 46.) winged two wild-ducks, which fell on the further side of a stream; his retriever tried to bring over both at once, but could not succeed; she then, though never before known to ruffle a feather, deliberately killed one, brought over the other, and returned for the dead bird. col. hutchinson relates that two partridges were shot at once, one being killed, the other wounded; the latter ran away, and was caught by the retriever, who on her return came across the dead bird; "she stopped, evidently greatly puzzled, and after one or two trials, finding she could not take it up without permitting the escape of the winged bird, she considered a moment, then deliberately murdered it by giving it a severe crunch, and afterwards brought away both together. this was the only known instance of her ever having wilfully injured any game." here we have reason though not quite perfect, for the retriever might have brought the wounded bird first and then returned for the dead one, as in the case of the two wild-ducks. i give the above cases, as resting on the evidence of two independent witnesses, and because in both instances the retrievers, after deliberation, broke through a habit which is inherited by them (that of not killing the game retrieved), and because they shew how strong their reasoning faculty must have been to overcome a fixed habit. i will conclude by quoting a remark by the illustrious humboldt. (28. 'personal narrative,' eng. translat., vol. iii. p. 106.) "the muleteers in s. america say, 'i will not give you the mule whose step is easiest, but la mas racional,--the one that reasons best'"; and; as, he adds, "this popular expression, dictated by long experience, combats the system of animated machines, better perhaps than all the arguments of speculative philosophy." nevertheless some writers even yet deny that the higher animals possess a trace of reason; and they endeavour to explain away, by what appears to be mere verbiage, (29. i am glad to find that so acute a reasoner as mr. leslie stephen ('darwinism and divinity, essays on free thinking,' 1873, p. 80), in speaking of the supposed impassable barrier between the minds of man and the lower animals, says, "the distinctions, indeed, which have been drawn, seem to us to rest upon no better foundation than a great many other metaphysical distinctions; that is, the assumption that because you can give two things different names, they must therefore have different natures. it is difficult to understand how anybody who has ever kept a dog, or seen an elephant, can have any doubt as to an animal's power of performing the essential processes of reasoning.") all such facts as those above given. it has, i think, now been shewn that man and the higher animals, especially the primates, have some few instincts in common. all have the same senses, intuitions, and sensations,--similar passions, affections, and emotions, even the more complex ones, such as jealousy, suspicion, emulation, gratitude, and magnanimity; they practise deceit and are revengeful; they are sometimes susceptible to ridicule, and even have a sense of humour; they feel wonder and curiosity; they possess the same faculties of imitation, attention, deliberation, choice, memory, imagination, the association of ideas, and reason, though in very different degrees. the individuals of the same species graduate in intellect from absolute imbecility to high excellence. they are also liable to insanity, though far less often than in the case of man. (30. see 'madness in animals,' by dr. w. lauder lindsay, in 'journal of mental science,' july 1871.) nevertheless, many authors have insisted that man is divided by an insuperable barrier from all the lower animals in his mental faculties. i formerly made a collection of above a score of such aphorisms, but they are almost worthless, as their wide difference and number prove the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of the attempt. it has been asserted that man alone is capable of progressive improvement; that he alone makes use of tools or fire, domesticates other animals, or possesses property; that no animal has the power of abstraction, or of forming general concepts, is self-conscious and comprehends itself; that no animal employs language; that man alone has a sense of beauty, is liable to caprice, has the feeling of gratitude, mystery, etc.; believes in god, or is endowed with a conscience. i will hazard a few remarks on the more important and interesting of these points. archbishop sumner formerly maintained (31. quoted by sir c. lyell, 'antiquity of man,' p. 497.) that man alone is capable of progressive improvement. that he is capable of incomparably greater and more rapid improvement than is any other animal, admits of no dispute; and this is mainly due to his power of speaking and handing down his acquired knowledge. with animals, looking first to the individual, every one who has had any experience in setting traps, knows that young animals can be caught much more easily than old ones; and they can be much more easily approached by an enemy. even with respect to old animals, it is impossible to catch many in the same place and in the same kind of trap, or to destroy them by the same kind of poison; yet it is improbable that all should have partaken of the poison, and impossible that all should have been caught in a trap. they must learn caution by seeing their brethren caught or poisoned. in north america, where the fur-bearing animals have long been pursued, they exhibit, according to the unanimous testimony of all observers, an almost incredible amount of sagacity, caution and cunning; but trapping has been there so long carried on, that inheritance may possibly have come into play. i have received several accounts that when telegraphs are first set up in any district, many birds kill themselves by flying against the wires, but that in the course of a very few years they learn to avoid this danger, by seeing, as it would appear, their comrades killed. (32. for additional evidence, with details, see m. houzeau, 'études sur les facultés mentales des animaux,' tom. ii. 1872, p. 147.) if we look to successive generations, or to the race, there is no doubt that birds and other animals gradually both acquire and lose caution in relation to man or other enemies (33. see, with respect to birds on oceanic islands, my 'journal of researches during the voyage of the "beagle,"' 1845, p. 398. 'origin of species,' 5th ed. p. 260.); and this caution is certainly in chief part an inherited habit or instinct, but in part the result of individual experience. a good observer, leroy (34. 'lettres phil. sur l'intelligence des animaux,' nouvelle edit., 1802, p. 86.), states, that in districts where foxes are much hunted, the young, on first leaving their burrows, are incontestably much more wary than the old ones in districts where they are not much disturbed. our domestic dogs are descended from wolves and jackals (35. see the evidence on this head in chap. i. vol. i., 'on the variation of animals and plants under domestication.'), and though they may not have gained in cunning, and may have lost in wariness and suspicion, yet they have progressed in certain moral qualities, such as in affection, trust- worthiness, temper, and probably in general intelligence. the common rat has conquered and beaten several other species throughout europe, in parts of north america, new zealand, and recently in formosa, as well as on the mainland of china. mr. swinhoe (36. 'proceedings zoological society,' 1864, p. 186.), who describes these two latter cases, attributes the victory of the common rat over the large mus coninga to its superior cunning; and this latter quality may probably be attributed to the habitual exercise of all its faculties in avoiding extirpation by man, as well as to nearly all the less cunning or weak-minded rats having been continuously destroyed by him. it is, however, possible that the success of the common rat may be due to its having possessed greater cunning than its fellow- species, before it became associated with man. to maintain, independently of any direct evidence, that no animal during the course of ages has progressed in intellect or other mental faculties, is to beg the question of the evolution of species. we have seen that, according to lartet, existing mammals belonging to several orders have larger brains than their ancient tertiary prototypes. it has often been said that no animal uses any tool; but the chimpanzee in a state of nature cracks a native fruit, somewhat like a walnut, with a stone. (37. savage and wyman in 'boston journal of natural history,' vol. iv. 1843-44, p. 383.) rengger (38. 'säugethiere von paraguay,' 1830, s. 51-56.) easily taught an american monkey thus to break open hard palm-nuts; and afterwards of its own accord, it used stones to open other kinds of nuts, as well as boxes. it thus also removed the soft rind of fruit that had a disagreeable flavour. another monkey was taught to open the lid of a large box with a stick, and afterwards it used the stick as a lever to move heavy bodies; and i have myself seen a young orang put a stick into a crevice, slip his hand to the other end, and use it in the proper manner as a lever. the tamed elephants in india are well known to break off branches of trees and use them to drive away the flies; and this same act has been observed in an elephant in a state of nature. (39. the indian field, march 4, 1871.) i have seen a young orang, when she thought she was going to be whipped, cover and protect herself with a blanket or straw. in these several cases stones and sticks were employed as implements; but they are likewise used as weapons. brehm (40. 'thierleben,' b. i. s. 79, 82.) states, on the authority of the well-known traveller schimper, that in abyssinia when the baboons belonging to one species (c. gelada) descend in troops from the mountains to plunder the fields, they sometimes encounter troops of another species (c. hamadryas), and then a fight ensues. the geladas roll down great stones, which the hamadryas try to avoid, and then both species, making a great uproar, rush furiously against each other. brehm, when accompanying the duke of coburg-gotha, aided in an attack with fire-arms on a troop of baboons in the pass of mensa in abyssinia. the baboons in return rolled so many stones down the mountain, some as large as a man's head, that the attackers had to beat a hasty retreat; and the pass was actually closed for a time against the caravan. it deserves notice that these baboons thus acted in concert. mr. wallace (41. 'the malay archipelago,' vol. i. 1869, p. 87.) on three occasions saw female orangs, accompanied by their young, "breaking off branches and the great spiny fruit of the durian tree, with every appearance of rage; causing such a shower of missiles as effectually kept us from approaching too near the tree." as i have repeatedly seen, a chimpanzee will throw any object at hand at a person who offends him; and the before-mentioned baboon at the cape of good hope prepared mud for the purpose. in the zoological gardens, a monkey, which had weak teeth, used to break open nuts with a stone; and i was assured by the keepers that after using the stone, he hid it in the straw, and would not let any other monkey touch it. here, then, we have the idea of property; but this idea is common to every dog with a bone, and to most or all birds with their nests. the duke of argyll (42. 'primeval man,' 1869, pp. 145, 147.) remarks, that the fashioning of an implement for a special purpose is absolutely peculiar to man; and he considers that this forms an immeasurable gulf between him and the brutes. this is no doubt a very important distinction; but there appears to me much truth in sir j. lubbock's suggestion (43. 'prehistoric times,' 1865, p. 473, etc.), that when primeval man first used flint-stones for any purpose, he would have accidentally splintered them, and would then have used the sharp fragments. from this step it would be a small one to break the flints on purpose, and not a very wide step to fashion them rudely. this latter advance, however, may have taken long ages, if we may judge by the immense interval of time which elapsed before the men of the neolithic period took to grinding and polishing their stone tools. in breaking the flints, as sir j. lubbock likewise remarks, sparks would have been emitted, and in grinding them heat would have been evolved: thus the two usual methods of "obtaining fire may have originated." the nature of fire would have been known in the many volcanic regions where lava occasionally flows through forests. the anthropomorphous apes, guided probably by instinct, build for themselves temporary platforms; but as many instincts are largely controlled by reason, the simpler ones, such as this of building a platform, might readily pass into a voluntary and conscious act. the orang is known to cover itself at night with the leaves of the pandanus; and brehm states that one of his baboons used to protect itself from the heat of the sun by throwing a straw-mat over its head. in these several habits, we probably see the first steps towards some of the simpler arts, such as rude architecture and dress, as they arose amongst the early progenitors of man. abstraction, general conceptions, self-consciousness, mental individuality. it would be very difficult for any one with even much more knowledge than i possess, to determine how far animals exhibit any traces of these high mental powers. this difficulty arises from the impossibility of judging what passes through the mind of an animal; and again, the fact that writers differ to a great extent in the meaning which they attribute to the above terms, causes a further difficulty. if one may judge from various articles which have been published lately, the greatest stress seems to be laid on the supposed entire absence in animals of the power of abstraction, or of forming general concepts. but when a dog sees another dog at a distance, it is often clear that he perceives that it is a dog in the abstract; for when he gets nearer his whole manner suddenly changes, if the other dog be a friend. a recent writer remarks, that in all such cases it is a pure assumption to assert that the mental act is not essentially of the same nature in the animal as in man. if either refers what he perceives with his senses to a mental concept, then so do both. (44. mr. hookham, in a letter to prof. max muller, in the 'birmingham news,' may 1873.) when i say to my terrier, in an eager voice (and i have made the trial many times), "hi, hi, where is it?" she at once takes it as a sign that something is to be hunted, and generally first looks quickly all around, and then rushes into the nearest thicket, to scent for any game, but finding nothing, she looks up into any neighbouring tree for a squirrel. now do not these actions clearly shew that she had in her mind a general idea or concept that some animal is to be discovered and hunted? it may be freely admitted that no animal is self-conscious, if by this term it is implied, that he reflects on such points, as whence he comes or whither he will go, or what is life and death, and so forth. but how can we feel sure that an old dog with an excellent memory and some power of imagination, as shewn by his dreams, never reflects on his past pleasures or pains in the chase? and this would be a form of self-consciousness. on the other hand, as buchner (45. 'conférences sur la théorie darwinienne,' french translat. 1869, p. 132.) has remarked, how little can the hard- worked wife of a degraded australian savage, who uses very few abstract words, and cannot count above four, exert her self-consciousness, or reflect on the nature of her own existence. it is generally admitted, that the higher animals possess memory, attention, association, and even some imagination and reason. if these powers, which differ much in different animals, are capable of improvement, there seems no great improbability in more complex faculties, such as the higher forms of abstraction, and self- consciousness, etc., having been evolved through the development and combination of the simpler ones. it has been urged against the views here maintained that it is impossible to say at what point in the ascending scale animals become capable of abstraction, etc.; but who can say at what age this occurs in our young children? we see at least that such powers are developed in children by imperceptible degrees. that animals retain their mental individuality is unquestionable. when my voice awakened a train of old associations in the mind of the before- mentioned dog, he must have retained his mental individuality, although every atom of his brain had probably undergone change more than once during the interval of five years. this dog might have brought forward the argument lately advanced to crush all evolutionists, and said, "i abide amid all mental moods and all material changes...the teaching that atoms leave their impressions as legacies to other atoms falling into the places they have vacated is contradictory of the utterance of consciousness, and is therefore false; but it is the teaching necessitated by evolutionism, consequently the hypothesis is a false one." (46. the rev. dr. j. m'cann, 'anti-darwinism,' 1869, p. 13.) language. this faculty has justly been considered as one of the chief distinctions between man and the lower animals. but man, as a highly competent judge, archbishop whately remarks, "is not the only animal that can make use of language to express what is passing in his mind, and can understand, more or less, what is so expressed by another." (47. quoted in 'anthropological review,' 1864, p. 158.) in paraguay the cebus azarae when excited utters at least six distinct sounds, which excite in other monkeys similar emotions. (48. rengger, ibid. s. 45.) the movements of the features and gestures of monkeys are understood by us, and they partly understand ours, as rengger and others declare. it is a more remarkable fact that the dog, since being domesticated, has learnt to bark (49. see my 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. i. p. 27.) in at least four or five distinct tones. although barking is a new art, no doubt the wild parent-species of the dog expressed their feelings by cries of various kinds. with the domesticated dog we have the bark of eagerness, as in the chase; that of anger, as well as growling; the yelp or howl of despair, as when shut up; the baying at night; the bark of joy, as when starting on a walk with his master; and the very distinct one of demand or supplication, as when wishing for a door or window to be opened. according to houzeau, who paid particular attention to the subject, the domestic fowl utters at least a dozen significant sounds. (50. 'facultés mentales des animaux,' tom. ii. 1872, p. 346-349.) the habitual use of articulate language is, however, peculiar to man; but he uses, in common with the lower animals, inarticulate cries to express his meaning, aided by gestures and the movements of the muscles of the face. (51. see a discussion on this subject in mr. e.b. tylor's very interesting work, 'researches into the early history of mankind,' 1865, chaps. ii. to iv.) this especially holds good with the more simple and vivid feelings, which are but little connected with our higher intelligence. our cries of pain, fear, surprise, anger, together with their appropriate actions, and the murmur of a mother to her beloved child are more expressive than any words. that which distinguishes man from the lower animals is not the understanding of articulate sounds, for, as every one knows, dogs understand many words and sentences. in this respect they are at the same stage of development as infants, between the ages of ten and twelve months, who understand many words and short sentences, but cannot yet utter a single word. it is not the mere articulation which is our distinguishing character, for parrots and other birds possess this power. nor is it the mere capacity of connecting definite sounds with definite ideas; for it is certain that some parrots, which have been taught to speak, connect unerringly words with things, and persons with events. (52. i have received several detailed accounts to this effect. admiral sir b.j. sulivan, whom i know to be a careful observer, assures me that an african parrot, long kept in his father's house, invariably called certain persons of the household, as well as visitors, by their names. he said "good morning" to every one at breakfast, and "good night" to each as they left the room at night, and never reversed these salutations. to sir b.j. sulivan's father, he used to add to the " good morning" a short sentence, which was never once repeated after his father's death. he scolded violently a strange dog which came into the room through the open window; and he scolded another parrot (saying "you naughty polly") which had got out of its cage, and was eating apples on the kitchen table. see also, to the same effect, houzeau on parrots, 'facultés mentales,' tom. ii. p. 309. dr. a. moschkau informs me that he knew a starling which never made a mistake in saying in german "good morning" to persons arriving, and "good bye, old fellow," to those departing. i could add several other such cases.) the lower animals differ from man solely in his almost infinitely larger power of associating together the most diversified sounds and ideas; and this obviously depends on the high development of his mental powers. as horne tooke, one of the founders of the noble science of philology, observes, language is an art, like brewing or baking; but writing would have been a better simile. it certainly is not a true instinct, for every language has to be learnt. it differs, however, widely from all ordinary arts, for man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children; whilst no child has an instinctive tendency to brew, bake, or write. moreover, no philologist now supposes that any language has been deliberately invented; it has been slowly and unconsciously developed by many steps. (53. see some good remarks on this head by prof. whitney, in his 'oriental and linguistic studies,' 1873, p. 354. he observes that the desire of communication between man is the living force, which, in the development of language, "works both consciously and unconsciously; consciously as regards the immediate end to be attained; unconsciously as regards the further consequences of the act.") the sounds uttered by birds offer in several respects the nearest analogy to language, for all the members of the same species utter the same instinctive cries expressive of their emotions; and all the kinds which sing, exert their power instinctively; but the actual song, and even the call-notes, are learnt from their parents or foster-parents. these sounds, as daines barrington (54. hon. daines barrington in 'philosoph. transactions,' 1773, p. 262. see also dureau de la malle, in 'ann. des. sc. nat.' 3rd series, zoolog., tom. x. p. 119.) has proved, "are no more innate than language is in man." the first attempts to sing "may be compared to the imperfect endeavour in a child to babble." the young males continue practising, or as the bird-catchers say, "recording," for ten or eleven months. their first essays shew hardly a rudiment of the future song; but as they grow older we can perceive what they are aiming at; and at last they are said "to sing their song round." nestlings which have learnt the song of a distinct species, as with the canary-birds educated in the tyrol, teach and transmit their new song to their offspring. the slight natural differences of song in the same species inhabiting different districts may be appositely compared, as barrington remarks, "to provincial dialects"; and the songs of allied, though distinct species may be compared with the languages of distinct races of man. i have given the foregoing details to shew that an instinctive tendency to acquire an art is not peculiar to man. with respect to the origin of articulate language, after having read on the one side the highly interesting works of mr. hensleigh wedgwood, the rev. f. farrar, and prof. schleicher (55. 'on the origin of language,' by h. wedgwood, 1866. 'chapters on language,' by the rev. f.w. farrar, 1865. these works are most interesting. see also 'de la phys. et de parole,' par albert lemoine, 1865, p. 190. the work on this subject, by the late prof. aug. schleicher, has been translated by dr. bikkers into english, under the title of 'darwinism tested by the science of language,' 1869.), and the celebrated lectures of prof. max muller on the other side, i cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries, aided by signs and gestures. when we treat of sexual selection we shall see that primeval man, or rather some early progenitor of man, probably first used his voice in producing true musical cadences, that is in singing, as do some of the gibbon-apes at the present day; and we may conclude from a widely-spread analogy, that this power would have been especially exerted during the courtship of the sexes,--would have expressed various emotions, such as love, jealousy, triumph,--and would have served as a challenge to rivals. it is, therefore, probable that the imitation of musical cries by articulate sounds may have given rise to words expressive of various complex emotions. the strong tendency in our nearest allies, the monkeys, in microcephalous idiots (56. vogt, 'mémoire sur les microcephales,' 1867, p. 169. with respect to savages, i have given some facts in my 'journal of researches,' etc., 1845, p. 206.), and in the barbarous races of mankind, to imitate whatever they hear deserves notice, as bearing on the subject of imitation. since monkeys certainly understand much that is said to them by man, and when wild, utter signal-cries of danger to their fellows (57. see clear evidence on this head in the two works so often quoted, by brehm and rengger.); and since fowls give distinct warnings for danger on the ground, or in the sky from hawks (both, as well as a third cry, intelligible to dogs) (58. houzeau gives a very curious account of his observations on this subject in his 'facultés mentales des animaux,' tom. ii. p. 348.), may not some unusually wise ape- like animal have imitated the growl of a beast of prey, and thus told his fellow-monkeys the nature of the expected danger? this would have been a first step in the formation of a language. as the voice was used more and more, the vocal organs would have been strengthened and perfected through the principle of the inherited effects of use; and this would have reacted on the power of speech. but the relation between the continued use of language and the development of the brain, has no doubt been far more important. the mental powers in some early progenitor of man must have been more highly developed than in any existing ape, before even the most imperfect form of speech could have come into use; but we may confidently believe that the continued use and advancement of this power would have reacted on the mind itself, by enabling and encouraging it to carry on long trains of thought. a complex train of thought can no more be carried on without the aid of words, whether spoken or silent, than a long calculation without the use of figures or algebra. it appears, also, that even an ordinary train of thought almost requires, or is greatly facilitated by some form of language, for the dumb, deaf, and blind girl, laura bridgman, was observed to use her fingers whilst dreaming. (59. see remarks on this head by dr. maudsley, 'the physiology and pathology of mind,' 2nd ed., 1868, p. 199.) nevertheless, a long succession of vivid and connected ideas may pass through the mind without the aid of any form of language, as we may infer from the movements of dogs during their dreams. we have, also, seen that animals are able to reason to a certain extent, manifestly without the aid of language. the intimate connection between the brain, as it is now developed in us, and the faculty of speech, is well shewn by those curious cases of brain-disease in which speech is specially affected, as when the power to remember substantives is lost, whilst other words can be correctly used, or where substantives of a certain class, or all except the initial letters of substantives and proper names are forgotten. (60. many curious cases have been recorded. see, for instance, dr. bateman 'on aphasia,' 1870, pp. 27, 31, 53, 100, etc. also, 'inquiries concerning the intellectual powers,' by dr. abercrombie, 1838, p. 150.) there is no more improbability in the continued use of the mental and vocal organs leading to inherited changes in their structure and functions, than in the case of hand-writing, which depends partly on the form of the hand and partly on the disposition of the mind; and handwriting is certainly inherited. (61. 'the variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. p. 6.') several writers, more especially prof. max muller (62. lectures on 'mr. darwin's philosophy of language,' 1873.), have lately insisted that the use of language implies the power of forming general concepts; and that as no animals are supposed to possess this power, an impassable barrier is formed between them and man. (63. the judgment of a distinguished philologist, such as prof. whitney, will have far more weight on this point than anything that i can say. he remarks ('oriental and linguistic studies,' 1873, p. 297), in speaking of bleek's views: "because on the grand scale language is the necessary auxiliary of thought, indispensable to the development of the power of thinking, to the distinctness and variety and complexity of cognitions to the full mastery of consciousness; therefore he would fain make thought absolutely impossible without speech, identifying the faculty with its instrument. he might just as reasonably assert that the human hand cannot act without a tool. with such a doctrine to start from, he cannot stop short of max muller's worst paradoxes, that an infant (in fans, not speaking) is not a human being, and that deaf-mutes do not become possessed of reason until they learn to twist their fingers into imitation of spoken words." max muller gives in italics ('lectures on mr. darwin's philosophy of language,' 1873, third lecture) this aphorism: "there is no thought without words, as little as there are words without thought." what a strange definition must here be given to the word thought!) with respect to animals, i have already endeavoured to shew that they have this power, at least in a rude and incipient degree. as far as concerns infants of from ten to eleven months old, and deaf-mutes, it seems to me incredible, that they should be able to connect certain sounds with certain general ideas as quickly as they do, unless such ideas were already formed in their minds. the same remark may be extended to the more intelligent animals; as mr. leslie stephen observes (64. 'essays on free thinking,' etc., 1873, p. 82.), "a dog frames a general concept of cats or sheep, and knows the corresponding words as well as a philosopher. and the capacity to understand is as good a proof of vocal intelligence, though in an inferior degree, as the capacity to speak." why the organs now used for speech should have been originally perfected for this purpose, rather than any other organs, it is not difficult to see. ants have considerable powers of intercommunication by means of their antennae, as shewn by huber, who devotes a whole chapter to their language. we might have used our fingers as efficient instruments, for a person with practice can report to a deaf man every word of a speech rapidly delivered at a public meeting; but the loss of our hands, whilst thus employed, would have been a serious inconvenience. as all the higher mammals possess vocal organs, constructed on the same general plan as ours, and used as a means of communication, it was obviously probable that these same organs would be still further developed if the power of communication had to be improved; and this has been effected by the aid of adjoining and well adapted parts, namely the tongue and lips. (65. see some good remarks to this effect by dr. maudsley, 'the physiology and pathology of mind,' 1868, p. 199.) the fact of the higher apes not using their vocal organs for speech, no doubt depends on their intelligence not having been sufficiently advanced. the possession by them of organs, which with long-continued practice might have been used for speech, although not thus used, is paralleled by the case of many birds which possess organs fitted for singing, though they never sing. thus, the nightingale and crow have vocal organs similarly constructed, these being used by the former for diversified song, and by the latter only for croaking. (66. macgillivray, 'hist. of british birds,' vol. ii. 1839, p. 29. an excellent observer, mr. blackwall, remarks that the magpie learns to pronounce single words, and even short sentences, more readily than almost any other british bird; yet, as he adds, after long and closely investigating its habits, he has never known it, in a state of nature, display any unusual capacity for imitation. 'researches in zoology,' 1834, p. 158.) if it be asked why apes have not had their intellects developed to the same degree as that of man, general causes only can be assigned in answer, and it is unreasonable to expect any thing more definite, considering our ignorance with respect to the successive stages of development through which each creature has passed. the formation of different languages and of distinct species, and the proofs that both have been developed through a gradual process, are curiously parallel. (67. see the very interesting parallelism between the development of species and languages, given by sir c. lyell in 'the geological evidences of the antiquity of man,' 1863, chap. xxiii.) but we can trace the formation of many words further back than that of species, for we can perceive how they actually arose from the imitation of various sounds. we find in distinct languages striking homologies due to community of descent, and analogies due to a similar process of formation. the manner in which certain letters or sounds change when others change is very like correlated growth. we have in both cases the reduplication of parts, the effects of long-continued use, and so forth. the frequent presence of rudiments, both in languages and in species, is still more remarkable. the letter m in the word am, means i; so that in the expression i am, a superfluous and useless rudiment has been retained. in the spelling also of words, letters often remain as the rudiments of ancient forms of pronunciation. languages, like organic beings, can be classed in groups under groups; and they can be classed either naturally according to descent, or artificially by other characters. dominant languages and dialects spread widely, and lead to the gradual extinction of other tongues. a language, like a species, when once extinct, never, as sir c. lyell remarks, reappears. the same language never has two birth-places. distinct languages may be crossed or blended together. (68. see remarks to this effect by the rev. f.w. farrar, in an interesting article, entitled 'philology and darwinism,' in 'nature,' march 24th, 1870, p. 528.) we see variability in every tongue, and new words are continually cropping up; but as there is a limit to the powers of the memory, single words, like whole languages, gradually become extinct. as max muller (69. 'nature,' january 6th, 1870, p. 257.) has well remarked:--"a struggle for life is constantly going on amongst the words and grammatical forms in each language. the better, the shorter, the easier forms are constantly gaining the upper hand, and they owe their success to their own inherent virtue." to these more important causes of the survival of certain words, mere novelty and fashion may be added; for there is in the mind of man a strong love for slight changes in all things. the survival or preservation of certain favoured words in the struggle for existence is natural selection. the perfectly regular and wonderfully complex construction of the languages of many barbarous nations has often been advanced as a proof, either of the divine origin of these languages, or of the high art and former civilisation of their founders. thus f. von schlegel writes: "in those languages which appear to be at the lowest grade of intellectual culture, we frequently observe a very high and elaborate degree of art in their grammatical structure. this is especially the case with the basque and the lapponian, and many of the american languages." (70. quoted by c.s. wake, 'chapters on man,' 1868, p. 101.) but it is assuredly an error to speak of any language as an art, in the sense of its having been elaborately and methodically formed. philologists now admit that conjugations, declensions, etc., originally existed as distinct words, since joined together; and as such words express the most obvious relations between objects and persons, it is not surprising that they should have been used by the men of most races during the earliest ages. with respect to perfection, the following illustration will best shew how easily we may err: a crinoid sometimes consists of no less than 150,000 pieces of shell (71. buckland, 'bridgewater treatise,' p. 411.), all arranged with perfect symmetry in radiating lines; but a naturalist does not consider an animal of this kind as more perfect than a bilateral one with comparatively few parts, and with none of these parts alike, excepting on the opposite sides of the body. he justly considers the differentiation and specialisation of organs as the test of perfection. so with languages: the most symmetrical and complex ought not to be ranked above irregular, abbreviated, and bastardised languages, which have borrowed expressive words and useful forms of construction from various conquering, conquered, or immigrant races. from these few and imperfect remarks i conclude that the extremely complex and regular construction of many barbarous languages, is no proof that they owe their origin to a special act of creation. (72. see some good remarks on the simplification of languages, by sir j. lubbock, 'origin of civilisation,' 1870, p. 278.) nor, as we have seen, does the faculty of articulate speech in itself offer any insuperable objection to the belief that man has been developed from some lower form. sense of beauty. this sense has been declared to be peculiar to man. i refer here only to the pleasure given by certain colours, forms, and sounds, and which may fairly be called a sense of the beautiful; with cultivated men such sensations are, however, intimately associated with complex ideas and trains of thought. when we behold a male bird elaborately displaying his graceful plumes or splendid colours before the female, whilst other birds, not thus decorated, make no such display, it is impossible to doubt that she admires the beauty of her male partner. as women everywhere deck themselves with these plumes, the beauty of such ornaments cannot be disputed. as we shall see later, the nests of humming-birds, and the playing passages of bower-birds are tastefully ornamented with gaily- coloured objects; and this shews that they must receive some kind of pleasure from the sight of such things. with the great majority of animals, however, the taste for the beautiful is confined, as far as we can judge, to the attractions of the opposite sex. the sweet strains poured forth by many male birds during the season of love, are certainly admired by the females, of which fact evidence will hereafter be given. if female birds had been incapable of appreciating the beautiful colours, the ornaments, and voices of their male partners, all the labour and anxiety exhibited by the latter in displaying their charms before the females would have been thrown away; and this it is impossible to admit. why certain bright colours should excite pleasure cannot, i presume, be explained, any more than why certain flavours and scents are agreeable; but habit has something to do with the result, for that which is at first unpleasant to our senses, ultimately becomes pleasant, and habits are inherited. with respect to sounds, helmholtz has explained to a certain extent on physiological principles, why harmonies and certain cadences are agreeable. but besides this, sounds frequently recurring at irregular intervals are highly disagreeable, as every one will admit who has listened at night to the irregular flapping of a rope on board ship. the same principle seems to come into play with vision, as the eye prefers symmetry or figures with some regular recurrence. patterns of this kind are employed by even the lowest savages as ornaments; and they have been developed through sexual selection for the adornment of some male animals. whether we can or not give any reason for the pleasure thus derived from vision and hearing, yet man and many of the lower animals are alike pleased by the same colours, graceful shading and forms, and the same sounds. the taste for the beautiful, at least as far as female beauty is concerned, is not of a special nature in the human mind; for it differs widely in the different races of man, and is not quite the same even in the different nations of the same race. judging from the hideous ornaments, and the equally hideous music admired by most savages, it might be urged that their aesthetic faculty was not so highly developed as in certain animals, for instance, as in birds. obviously no animal would be capable of admiring such scenes as the heavens at night, a beautiful landscape, or refined music; but such high tastes are acquired through culture, and depend on complex associations; they are not enjoyed by barbarians or by uneducated persons. many of the faculties, which have been of inestimable service to man for his progressive advancement, such as the powers of the imagination, wonder, curiosity, an undefined sense of beauty, a tendency to imitation, and the love of excitement or novelty, could hardly fail to lead to capricious changes of customs and fashions. i have alluded to this point, because a recent writer (73. 'the spectator,' dec. 4th, 1869, p. 1430.) has oddly fixed on caprice "as one of the most remarkable and typical differences between savages and brutes." but not only can we partially understand how it is that man is from various conflicting influences rendered capricious, but that the lower animals are, as we shall hereafter see, likewise capricious in their affections, aversions, and sense of beauty. there is also reason to suspect that they love novelty, for its own sake. belief in god--religion. there is no evidence that man was aboriginally endowed with the ennobling belief in the existence of an omnipotent god. on the contrary there is ample evidence, derived not from hasty travellers, but from men who have long resided with savages, that numerous races have existed, and still exist, who have no idea of one or more gods, and who have no words in their languages to express such an idea. (74. see an excellent article on this subject by the rev. f.w. farrar, in the 'anthropological review,' aug. 1864, p. ccxvii. for further facts see sir j. lubbock, 'prehistoric times,' 2nd edit., 1869, p. 564; and especially the chapters on religion in his 'origin of civilisation,' 1870.) the question is of course wholly distinct from that higher one, whether there exists a creator and ruler of the universe; and this has been answered in the affirmative by some of the highest intellects that have ever existed. if, however, we include under the term "religion" the belief in unseen or spiritual agencies, the case is wholly different; for this belief seems to be universal with the less civilised races. nor is it difficult to comprehend how it arose. as soon as the important faculties of the imagination, wonder, and curiosity, together with some power of reasoning, had become partially developed, man would naturally crave to understand what was passing around him, and would have vaguely speculated on his own existence. as mr. m'lennan (75. 'the worship of animals and plants,' in the 'fortnightly review,' oct. 1, 1869, p. 422.) has remarked, "some explanation of the phenomena of life, a man must feign for himself, and to judge from the universality of it, the simplest hypothesis, and the first to occur to men, seems to have been that natural phenomena are ascribable to the presence in animals, plants, and things, and in the forces of nature, of such spirits prompting to action as men are conscious they themselves possess." it is also probable, as mr. tylor has shewn, that dreams may have first given rise to the notion of spirits; for savages do not readily distinguish between subjective and objective impressions. when a savage dreams, the figures which appear before him are believed to have come from a distance, and to stand over him; or "the soul of the dreamer goes out on its travels, and comes home with a remembrance of what it has seen." (76. tylor, 'early history of mankind,' 1865, p. 6. see also the three striking chapters on the 'development of religion,' in lubbock's 'origin of civilisation,' 1870. in a like manner mr. herbert spencer, in his ingenious essay in the 'fortnightly review' (may 1st, 1870, p. 535), accounts for the earliest forms of religious belief throughout the world, by man being led through dreams, shadows, and other causes, to look at himself as a double essence, corporeal and spiritual. as the spiritual being is supposed to exist after death and to be powerful, it is propitiated by various gifts and ceremonies, and its aid invoked. he then further shews that names or nicknames given from some animal or other object, to the early progenitors or founders of a tribe, are supposed after a long interval to represent the real progenitor of the tribe; and such animal or object is then naturally believed still to exist as a spirit, is held sacred, and worshipped as a god. nevertheless i cannot but suspect that there is a still earlier and ruder stage, when anything which manifests power or movement is thought to be endowed with some form of life, and with mental faculties analogous to our own.) but until the faculties of imagination, curiosity, reason, etc., had been fairly well developed in the mind of man, his dreams would not have led him to believe in spirits, any more than in the case of a dog. the tendency in savages to imagine that natural objects and agencies are animated by spiritual or living essences, is perhaps illustrated by a little fact which i once noticed: my dog, a full-grown and very sensible animal, was lying on the lawn during a hot and still day; but at a little distance a slight breeze occasionally moved an open parasol, which would have been wholly disregarded by the dog, had any one stood near it. as it was, every time that the parasol slightly moved, the dog growled fiercely and barked. he must, i think, have reasoned to himself in a rapid and unconscious manner, that movement without any apparent cause indicated the presence of some strange living agent, and that no stranger had a right to be on his territory. the belief in spiritual agencies would easily pass into the belief in the existence of one or more gods. for savages would naturally attribute to spirits the same passions, the same love of vengeance or simplest form of justice, and the same affections which they themselves feel. the fuegians appear to be in this respect in an intermediate condition, for when the surgeon on board the "beagle" shot some young ducklings as specimens, york minster declared in the most solemn manner, "oh, mr. bynoe, much rain, much snow, blow much"; and this was evidently a retributive punishment for wasting human food. so again he related how, when his brother killed a "wild man," storms long raged, much rain and snow fell. yet we could never discover that the fuegians believed in what we should call a god, or practised any religious rites; and jemmy button, with justifiable pride, stoutly maintained that there was no devil in his land. this latter assertion is the more remarkable, as with savages the belief in bad spirits is far more common than that in good ones. the feeling of religious devotion is a highly complex one, consisting of love, complete submission to an exalted and mysterious superior, a strong sense of dependence (77. see an able article on the 'physical elements of religion,' by mr. l. owen pike, in 'anthropological review,' april 1870, p. lxiii.), fear, reverence, gratitude, hope for the future, and perhaps other elements. no being could experience so complex an emotion until advanced in his intellectual and moral faculties to at least a moderately high level. nevertheless, we see some distant approach to this state of mind in the deep love of a dog for his master, associated with complete submission, some fear, and perhaps other feelings. the behaviour of a dog when returning to his master after an absence, and, as i may add, of a monkey to his beloved keeper, is widely different from that towards their fellows. in the latter case the transports of joy appear to be somewhat less, and the sense of equality is shewn in every action. professor braubach goes so far as to maintain that a dog looks on his master as on a god. (78. 'religion, moral, etc., der darwin'schen art-lehre,' 1869, s. 53. it is said (dr. w. lauder lindsay, 'journal of mental science,' 1871, p. 43), that bacon long ago, and the poet burns, held the same notion.) the same high mental faculties which first led man to believe in unseen spiritual agencies, then in fetishism, polytheism, and ultimately in monotheism, would infallibly lead him, as long as his reasoning powers remained poorly developed, to various strange superstitions and customs. many of these are terrible to think of--such as the sacrifice of human beings to a blood-loving god; the trial of innocent persons by the ordeal of poison or fire; witchcraft, etc.--yet it is well occasionally to reflect on these superstitions, for they shew us what an infinite debt of gratitude we owe to the improvement of our reason, to science, and to our accumulated knowledge. as sir j. lubbock (79. 'prehistoric times,' 2nd edit., p. 571. in this work (p. 571) there will be found an excellent account of the many strange and capricious customs of savages.) has well observed, "it is not too much to say that the horrible dread of unknown evil hangs like a thick cloud over savage life, and embitters every pleasure." these miserable and indirect consequences of our highest faculties may be compared with the incidental and occasional mistakes of the instincts of the lower animals. chapter iv. comparison of the mental powers of man and the lower animals--continued. the moral sense--fundamental proposition--the qualities of social animals-- origin of sociability--struggle between opposed instincts--man a social animal--the more enduring social instincts conquer other less persistent instincts--the social virtues alone regarded by savages--the self-regarding virtues acquired at a later stage of development--the importance of the judgment of the members of the same community on conduct--transmission of moral tendencies--summary. i fully subscribe to the judgment of those writers (1. see, for instance, on this subject, quatrefages, 'unité de l'espèce humaine,' 1861, p. 21, etc.) who maintain that of all the differences between man and the lower animals, the moral sense or conscience is by far the most important. this sense, as mackintosh (2. 'dissertation on ethical philosophy,' 1837, p. 231, etc.) remarks, "has a rightful supremacy over every other principle of human action"; it is summed up in that short but imperious word "ought," so full of high significance. it is the most noble of all the attributes of man, leading him without a moment's hesitation to risk his life for that of a fellow-creature; or after due deliberation, impelled simply by the deep feeling of right or duty, to sacrifice it in some great cause. immanuel kant exclaims, "duty! wondrous thought, that workest neither by fond insinuation, flattery, nor by any threat, but merely by holding up thy naked law in the soul, and so extorting for thyself always reverence, if not always obedience; before whom all appetites are dumb, however secretly they rebel; whence thy original?" (3. 'metaphysics of ethics,' translated by j.w. semple, edinburgh, 1836, p. 136.) this great question has been discussed by many writers (4. mr. bain gives a list ('mental and moral science,' 1868, pp. 543-725) of twenty-six british authors who have written on this subject, and whose names are familiar to every reader; to these, mr. bain's own name, and those of mr. lecky, mr. shadworth hodgson, sir j. lubbock, and others, might be added.) of consummate ability; and my sole excuse for touching on it, is the impossibility of here passing it over; and because, as far as i know, no one has approached it exclusively from the side of natural history. the investigation possesses, also, some independent interest, as an attempt to see how far the study of the lower animals throws light on one of the highest psychical faculties of man. the following proposition seems to me in a high degree probable--namely, that any animal whatever, endowed with well-marked social instincts (5. sir b. brodie, after observing that man is a social animal ('psychological enquiries,' 1854, p. 192), asks the pregnant question, "ought not this to settle the disputed question as to the existence of a moral sense?" similar ideas have probably occurred to many persons, as they did long ago to marcus aurelius. mr. j.s. mill speaks, in his celebrated work, 'utilitarianism,' (1864, pp. 45, 46), of the social feelings as a "powerful natural sentiment," and as "the natural basis of sentiment for utilitarian morality." again he says, "like the other acquired capacities above referred to, the moral faculty, if not a part of our nature, is a natural out-growth from it; capable, like them, in a certain small degree of springing up spontaneously." but in opposition to all this, he also remarks, "if, as in my own belief, the moral feelings are not innate, but acquired, they are not for that reason less natural." it is with hesitation that i venture to differ at all from so profound a thinker, but it can hardly be disputed that the social feelings are instinctive or innate in the lower animals; and why should they not be so in man? mr. bain (see, for instance, 'the emotions and the will,' 1865, p. 481) and others believe that the moral sense is acquired by each individual during his lifetime. on the general theory of evolution this is at least extremely improbable. the ignoring of all transmitted mental qualities will, as it seems to me, be hereafter judged as a most serious blemish in the works of mr. mill.), the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its intellectual powers had become as well, or nearly as well developed, as in man. for, firstly, the social instincts lead an animal to take pleasure in the society of its fellows, to feel a certain amount of sympathy with them, and to perform various services for them. the services may be of a definite and evidently instinctive nature; or there may be only a wish and readiness, as with most of the higher social animals, to aid their fellows in certain general ways. but these feelings and services are by no means extended to all the individuals of the same species, only to those of the same association. secondly, as soon as the mental faculties had become highly developed, images of all past actions and motives would be incessantly passing through the brain of each individual: and that feeling of dissatisfaction, or even misery, which invariably results, as we shall hereafter see, from any unsatisfied instinct, would arise, as often as it was perceived that the enduring and always present social instinct had yielded to some other instinct, at the time stronger, but neither enduring in its nature, nor leaving behind it a very vivid impression. it is clear that many instinctive desires, such as that of hunger, are in their nature of short duration; and after being satisfied, are not readily or vividly recalled. thirdly, after the power of language had been acquired, and the wishes of the community could be expressed, the common opinion how each member ought to act for the public good, would naturally become in a paramount degree the guide to action. but it should be borne in mind that however great weight we may attribute to public opinion, our regard for the approbation and disapprobation of our fellows depends on sympathy, which, as we shall see, forms an essential part of the social instinct, and is indeed its foundation-stone. lastly, habit in the individual would ultimately play a very important part in guiding the conduct of each member; for the social instinct, together with sympathy, is, like any other instinct, greatly strengthened by habit, and so consequently would be obedience to the wishes and judgment of the community. these several subordinate propositions must now be discussed, and some of them at considerable length. it may be well first to premise that i do not wish to maintain that any strictly social animal, if its intellectual faculties were to become as active and as highly developed as in man, would acquire exactly the same moral sense as ours. in the same manner as various animals have some sense of beauty, though they admire widely-different objects, so they might have a sense of right and wrong, though led by it to follow widely different lines of conduct. if, for instance, to take an extreme case, men were reared under precisely the same conditions as hive-bees, there can hardly be a doubt that our unmarried females would, like the worker-bees, think it a sacred duty to kill their brothers, and mothers would strive to kill their fertile daughters; and no one would think of interfering. (6. mr. h. sidgwick remarks, in an able discussion on this subject (the 'academy,' june 15, 1872, p. 231), "a superior bee, we may feel sure, would aspire to a milder solution of the population question." judging, however, from the habits of many or most savages, man solves the problem by female infanticide, polyandry and promiscuous intercourse; therefore it may well be doubted whether it would be by a milder method. miss cobbe, in commenting ('darwinism in morals,' 'theological review,' april 1872, pp. 188-191) on the same illustration, says, the principles of social duty would be thus reversed; and by this, i presume, she means that the fulfilment of a social duty would tend to the injury of individuals; but she overlooks the fact, which she would doubtless admit, that the instincts of the bee have been acquired for the good of the community. she goes so far as to say that if the theory of ethics advocated in this chapter were ever generally accepted, "i cannot but believe that in the hour of their triumph would be sounded the knell of the virtue of mankind!" it is to be hoped that the belief in the permanence of virtue on this earth is not held by many persons on so weak a tenure.) nevertheless, the bee, or any other social animal, would gain in our supposed case, as it appears to me, some feeling of right or wrong, or a conscience. for each individual would have an inward sense of possessing certain stronger or more enduring instincts, and others less strong or enduring; so that there would often be a struggle as to which impulse should be followed; and satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or even misery would be felt, as past impressions were compared during their incessant passage through the mind. in this case an inward monitor would tell the animal that it would have been better to have followed the one impulse rather than the other. the one course ought to have been followed, and the other ought not; the one would have been right and the other wrong; but to these terms i shall recur. sociability. animals of many kinds are social; we find even distinct species living together; for example, some american monkeys; and united flocks of rooks, jackdaws, and starlings. man shews the same feeling in his strong love for the dog, which the dog returns with interest. every one must have noticed how miserable horses, dogs, sheep, etc., are when separated from their companions, and what strong mutual affection the two former kinds, at least, shew on their reunion. it is curious to speculate on the feelings of a dog, who will rest peacefully for hours in a room with his master or any of the family, without the least notice being taken of him; but if left for a short time by himself, barks or howls dismally. we will confine our attention to the higher social animals; and pass over insects, although some of these are social, and aid one another in many important ways. the most common mutual service in the higher animals is to warn one another of danger by means of the united senses of all. every sportsman knows, as dr. jaeger remarks (7. 'die darwin'sche theorie,' s. 101.), how difficult it is to approach animals in a herd or troop. wild horses and cattle do not, i believe, make any danger-signal; but the attitude of any one of them who first discovers an enemy, warns the others. rabbits stamp loudly on the ground with their hind-feet as a signal: sheep and chamois do the same with their forefeet, uttering likewise a whistle. many birds, and some mammals, post sentinels, which in the case of seals are said (8. mr. r. brown in 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1868, p. 409.) generally to be the females. the leader of a troop of monkeys acts as the sentinel, and utters cries expressive both of danger and of safety. (9. brehm, 'thierleben,' b. i. 1864, s. 52, 79. for the case of the monkeys extracting thorns from each other, see s. 54. with respect to the hamadryas turning over stones, the fact is given (s. 76), on the evidence of alvarez, whose observations brehm thinks quite trustworthy. for the cases of the old male baboons attacking the dogs, see s. 79; and with respect to the eagle, s. 56.) social animals perform many little services for each other: horses nibble, and cows lick each other, on any spot which itches: monkeys search each other for external parasites; and brehm states that after a troop of the cercopithecus griseo-viridis has rushed through a thorny brake, each monkey stretches itself on a branch, and another monkey sitting by, "conscientiously" examines its fur, and extracts every thorn or burr. animals also render more important services to one another: thus wolves and some other beasts of prey hunt in packs, and aid one another in attacking their victims. pelicans fish in concert. the hamadryas baboons turn over stones to find insects, etc.; and when they come to a large one, as many as can stand round, turn it over together and share the booty. social animals mutually defend each other. bull bisons in n. america, when there is danger, drive the cows and calves into the middle of the herd, whilst they defend the outside. i shall also in a future chapter give an account of two young wild bulls at chillingham attacking an old one in concert, and of two stallions together trying to drive away a third stallion from a troop of mares. in abyssinia, brehm encountered a great troop of baboons who were crossing a valley: some had already ascended the opposite mountain, and some were still in the valley; the latter were attacked by the dogs, but the old males immediately hurried down from the rocks, and with mouths widely opened, roared so fearfully, that the dogs quickly drew back. they were again encouraged to the attack; but by this time all the baboons had reascended the heights, excepting a young one, about six months old, who, loudly calling for aid, climbed on a block of rock, and was surrounded. now one of the largest males, a true hero, came down again from the mountain, slowly went to the young one, coaxed him, and triumphantly led him away--the dogs being too much astonished to make an attack. i cannot resist giving another scene which was witnessed by this same naturalist; an eagle seized a young cercopithecus, which, by clinging to a branch, was not at once carried off; it cried loudly for assistance, upon which the other members of the troop, with much uproar, rushed to the rescue, surrounded the eagle, and pulled out so many feathers, that he no longer thought of his prey, but only how to escape. this eagle, as brehm remarks, assuredly would never again attack a single monkey of a troop. (10. mr. belt gives the case of a spider-monkey (ateles) in nicaragua, which was heard screaming for nearly two hours in the forest, and was found with an eagle perched close by it. the bird apparently feared to attack as long as it remained face to face; and mr. belt believes, from what he has seen of the habits of these monkeys, that they protect themselves from eagles by keeping two or three together. 'the naturalist in nicaragua,' 1874, p. 118.) it is certain that associated animals have a feeling of love for each other, which is not felt by non-social adult animals. how far in most cases they actually sympathise in the pains and pleasures of others, is more doubtful, especially with respect to pleasures. mr. buxton, however, who had excellent means of observation (11. 'annals and magazine of natural history,' november 1868, p. 382.), states that his macaws, which lived free in norfolk, took "an extravagant interest" in a pair with a nest; and whenever the female left it, she was surrounded by a troop "screaming horrible acclamations in her honour." it is often difficult to judge whether animals have any feeling for the sufferings of others of their kind. who can say what cows feel, when they surround and stare intently on a dying or dead companion; apparently, however, as houzeau remarks, they feel no pity. that animals sometimes are far from feeling any sympathy is too certain; for they will expel a wounded animal from the herd, or gore or worry it to death. this is almost the blackest fact in natural history, unless, indeed, the explanation which has been suggested is true, that their instinct or reason leads them to expel an injured companion, lest beasts of prey, including man, should be tempted to follow the troop. in this case their conduct is not much worse than that of the north american indians, who leave their feeble comrades to perish on the plains; or the fijians, who, when their parents get old, or fall ill, bury them alive. (12. sir j. lubbock, 'prehistoric times,' 2nd ed., p. 446.) many animals, however, certainly sympathise with each other's distress or danger. this is the case even with birds. captain stansbury (13. as quoted by mr. l.h. morgan, 'the american beaver,' 1868, p. 272. capt. stansbury also gives an interesting account of the manner in which a very young pelican, carried away by a strong stream, was guided and encouraged in its attempts to reach the shore by half a dozen old birds.) found on a salt lake in utah an old and completely blind pelican, which was very fat, and must have been well fed for a long time by his companions. mr. blyth, as he informs me, saw indian crows feeding two or three of their companions which were blind; and i have heard of an analogous case with the domestic cock. we may, if we choose, call these actions instinctive; but such cases are much too rare for the development of any special instinct. (14. as mr. bain states, "effective aid to a sufferer springs from sympathy proper:" 'mental and moral science,' 1868, p. 245.) i have myself seen a dog, who never passed a cat who lay sick in a basket, and was a great friend of his, without giving her a few licks with his tongue, the surest sign of kind feeling in a dog. it must be called sympathy that leads a courageous dog to fly at any one who strikes his master, as he certainly will. i saw a person pretending to beat a lady, who had a very timid little dog on her lap, and the trial had never been made before; the little creature instantly jumped away, but after the pretended beating was over, it was really pathetic to see how perseveringly he tried to lick his mistress's face, and comfort her. brehm (15. 'thierleben,' b. i. s. 85.) states that when a baboon in confinement was pursued to be punished, the others tried to protect him. it must have been sympathy in the cases above given which led the baboons and cercopitheci to defend their young comrades from the dogs and the eagle. i will give only one other instance of sympathetic and heroic conduct, in the case of a little american monkey. several years ago a keeper at the zoological gardens shewed me some deep and scarcely healed wounds on the nape of his own neck, inflicted on him, whilst kneeling on the floor, by a fierce baboon. the little american monkey, who was a warm friend of this keeper, lived in the same large compartment, and was dreadfully afraid of the great baboon. nevertheless, as soon as he saw his friend in peril, he rushed to the rescue, and by screams and bites so distracted the baboon that the man was able to escape, after, as the surgeon thought, running great risk of his life. besides love and sympathy, animals exhibit other qualities connected with the social instincts, which in us would be called moral; and i agree with agassiz (16. 'de l'espèce et de la classe,' 1869, p. 97.) that dogs possess something very like a conscience. dogs possess some power of self-command, and this does not appear to be wholly the result of fear. as braubach (17. 'die darwin'sche art-lehre,' 1869, s. 54.) remarks, they will refrain from stealing food in the absence of their master. they have long been accepted as the very type of fidelity and obedience. but the elephant is likewise very faithful to his driver or keeper, and probably considers him as the leader of the herd. dr. hooker informs me that an elephant, which he was riding in india, became so deeply bogged that he remained stuck fast until the next day, when he was extricated by men with ropes. under such circumstances elephants will seize with their trunks any object, dead or alive, to place under their knees, to prevent their sinking deeper in the mud; and the driver was dreadfully afraid lest the animal should have seized dr. hooker and crushed him to death. but the driver himself, as dr. hooker was assured, ran no risk. this forbearance under an emergency so dreadful for a heavy animal, is a wonderful proof of noble fidelity. (18. see also hooker's 'himalayan journals,' vol. ii. 1854, p. 333.) all animals living in a body, which defend themselves or attack their enemies in concert, must indeed be in some degree faithful to one another; and those that follow a leader must be in some degree obedient. when the baboons in abyssinia (19. brehm, 'thierleben,' b. i. s. 76.) plunder a garden, they silently follow their leader; and if an imprudent young animal makes a noise, he receives a slap from the others to teach him silence and obedience. mr. galton, who has had excellent opportunities for observing the half-wild cattle in s. africa, says (20. see his extremely interesting paper on 'gregariousness in cattle, and in man,' 'macmillan's magazine,' feb. 1871, p. 353.), that they cannot endure even a momentary separation from the herd. they are essentially slavish, and accept the common determination, seeking no better lot than to be led by any one ox who has enough self-reliance to accept the position. the men who break in these animals for harness, watch assiduously for those who, by grazing apart, shew a self-reliant disposition, and these they train as fore-oxen. mr. galton adds that such animals are rare and valuable; and if many were born they would soon be eliminated, as lions are always on the look-out for the individuals which wander from the herd. with respect to the impulse which leads certain animals to associate together, and to aid one another in many ways, we may infer that in most cases they are impelled by the same sense of satisfaction or pleasure which they experience in performing other instinctive actions; or by the same sense of dissatisfaction as when other instinctive actions are checked. we see this in innumerable instances, and it is illustrated in a striking manner by the acquired instincts of our domesticated animals; thus a young shepherd-dog delights in driving and running round a flock of sheep, but not in worrying them; a young fox-hound delights in hunting a fox, whilst some other kinds of dogs, as i have witnessed, utterly disregard foxes. what a strong feeling of inward satisfaction must impel a bird, so full of activity, to brood day after day over her eggs. migratory birds are quite miserable if stopped from migrating; perhaps they enjoy starting on their long flight; but it is hard to believe that the poor pinioned goose, described by audubon, which started on foot at the proper time for its journey of probably more than a thousand miles, could have felt any joy in doing so. some instincts are determined solely by painful feelings, as by fear, which leads to self-preservation, and is in some cases directed towards special enemies. no one, i presume, can analyse the sensations of pleasure or pain. in many instances, however, it is probable that instincts are persistently followed from the mere force of inheritance, without the stimulus of either pleasure or pain. a young pointer, when it first scents game, apparently cannot help pointing. a squirrel in a cage who pats the nuts which it cannot eat, as if to bury them in the ground, can hardly be thought to act thus, either from pleasure or pain. hence the common assumption that men must be impelled to every action by experiencing some pleasure or pain may be erroneous. although a habit may be blindly and implicitly followed, independently of any pleasure or pain felt at the moment, yet if it be forcibly and abruptly checked, a vague sense of dissatisfaction is generally experienced. it has often been assumed that animals were in the first place rendered social, and that they feel as a consequence uncomfortable when separated from each other, and comfortable whilst together; but it is a more probable view that these sensations were first developed, in order that those animals which would profit by living in society, should be induced to live together, in the same manner as the sense of hunger and the pleasure of eating were, no doubt, first acquired in order to induce animals to eat. the feeling of pleasure from society is probably an extension of the parental or filial affections, since the social instinct seems to be developed by the young remaining for a long time with their parents; and this extension may be attributed in part to habit, but chiefly to natural selection. with those animals which were benefited by living in close association, the individuals which took the greatest pleasure in society would best escape various dangers, whilst those that cared least for their comrades, and lived solitary, would perish in greater numbers. with respect to the origin of the parental and filial affections, which apparently lie at the base of the social instincts, we know not the steps by which they have been gained; but we may infer that it has been to a large extent through natural selection. so it has almost certainly been with the unusual and opposite feeling of hatred between the nearest relations, as with the worker-bees which kill their brother drones, and with the queen-bees which kill their daughter-queens; the desire to destroy their nearest relations having been in this case of service to the community. parental affection, or some feeling which replaces it, has been developed in certain animals extremely low in the scale, for example, in star-fishes and spiders. it is also occasionally present in a few members alone in a whole group of animals, as in the genus forficula, or earwigs. the all-important emotion of sympathy is distinct from that of love. a mother may passionately love her sleeping and passive infant, but she can hardly at such times be said to feel sympathy for it. the love of a man for his dog is distinct from sympathy, and so is that of a dog for his master. adam smith formerly argued, as has mr. bain recently, that the basis of sympathy lies in our strong retentiveness of former states of pain or pleasure. hence, "the sight of another person enduring hunger, cold, fatigue, revives in us some recollection of these states, which are painful even in idea." we are thus impelled to relieve the sufferings of another, in order that our own painful feelings may be at the same time relieved. in like manner we are led to participate in the pleasures of others. (21. see the first and striking chapter in adam smith's 'theory of moral sentiments.' also 'mr. bain's mental and moral science,' 1868, pp. 244, and 275-282. mr. bain states, that, "sympathy is, indirectly, a source of pleasure to the sympathiser"; and he accounts for this through reciprocity. he remarks that "the person benefited, or others in his stead, may make up, by sympathy and good offices returned, for all the sacrifice." but if, as appears to be the case, sympathy is strictly an instinct, its exercise would give direct pleasure, in the same manner as the exercise, as before remarked, of almost every other instinct.) but i cannot see how this view explains the fact that sympathy is excited, in an immeasurably stronger degree, by a beloved, than by an indifferent person. the mere sight of suffering, independently of love, would suffice to call up in us vivid recollections and associations. the explanation may lie in the fact that, with all animals, sympathy is directed solely towards the members of the same community, and therefore towards known, and more or less beloved members, but not to all the individuals of the same species. this fact is not more surprising than that the fears of many animals should be directed against special enemies. species which are not social, such as lions and tigers, no doubt feel sympathy for the suffering of their own young, but not for that of any other animal. with mankind, selfishness, experience, and imitation, probably add, as mr. bain has shewn, to the power of sympathy; for we are led by the hope of receiving good in return to perform acts of sympathetic kindness to others; and sympathy is much strengthened by habit. in however complex a manner this feeling may have originated, as it is one of high importance to all those animals which aid and defend one another, it will have been increased through natural selection; for those communities, which included the greatest number of the most sympathetic members, would flourish best, and rear the greatest number of offspring. it is, however, impossible to decide in many cases whether certain social instincts have been acquired through natural selection, or are the indirect result of other instincts and faculties, such as sympathy, reason, experience, and a tendency to imitation; or again, whether they are simply the result of long-continued habit. so remarkable an instinct as the placing sentinels to warn the community of danger, can hardly have been the indirect result of any of these faculties; it must, therefore, have been directly acquired. on the other hand, the habit followed by the males of some social animals of defending the community, and of attacking their enemies or their prey in concert, may perhaps have originated from mutual sympathy; but courage, and in most cases strength, must have been previously acquired, probably through natural selection. of the various instincts and habits, some are much stronger than others; that is, some either give more pleasure in their performance, and more distress in their prevention, than others; or, which is probably quite as important, they are, through inheritance, more persistently followed, without exciting any special feeling of pleasure or pain. we are ourselves conscious that some habits are much more difficult to cure or change than others. hence a struggle may often be observed in animals between different instincts, or between an instinct and some habitual disposition; as when a dog rushes after a hare, is rebuked, pauses, hesitates, pursues again, or returns ashamed to his master; or as between the love of a female dog for her young puppies and for her master,--for she may be seen to slink away to them, as if half ashamed of not accompanying her master. but the most curious instance known to me of one instinct getting the better of another, is the migratory instinct conquering the maternal instinct. the former is wonderfully strong; a confined bird will at the proper season beat her breast against the wires of her cage, until it is bare and bloody. it causes young salmon to leap out of the fresh water, in which they could continue to exist, and thus unintentionally to commit suicide. every one knows how strong the maternal instinct is, leading even timid birds to face great danger, though with hesitation, and in opposition to the instinct of self-preservation. nevertheless, the migratory instinct is so powerful, that late in the autumn swallows, house-martins, and swifts frequently desert their tender young, leaving them to perish miserably in their nests. (22. this fact, the rev. l. jenyns states (see his edition of 'white's nat. hist. of selborne,' 1853, p. 204) was first recorded by the illustrious jenner, in 'phil. transact.' 1824, and has since been confirmed by several observers, especially by mr. blackwall. this latter careful observer examined, late in the autumn, during two years, thirty-six nests; he found that twelve contained young dead birds, five contained eggs on the point of being hatched, and three, eggs not nearly hatched. many birds, not yet old enough for a prolonged flight, are likewise deserted and left behind. see blackwall, 'researches in zoology,' 1834, pp. 108, 118. for some additional evidence, although this is not wanted, see leroy, 'lettres phil.' 1802, p. 217. for swifts, gould's 'introduction to the birds of great britain,' 1823, p. 5. similar cases have been observed in canada by mr. adams; 'pop. science review,' july 1873, p. 283.) we can perceive that an instinctive impulse, if it be in any way more beneficial to a species than some other or opposed instinct, would be rendered the more potent of the two through natural selection; for the individuals which had it most strongly developed would survive in larger numbers. whether this is the case with the migratory in comparison with the maternal instinct, may be doubted. the great persistence, or steady action of the former at certain seasons of the year during the whole day, may give it for a time paramount force. man a social animal. every one will admit that man is a social being. we see this in his dislike of solitude, and in his wish for society beyond that of his own family. solitary confinement is one of the severest punishments which can be inflicted. some authors suppose that man primevally lived in single families; but at the present day, though single families, or only two or three together, roam the solitudes of some savage lands, they always, as far as i can discover, hold friendly relations with other families inhabiting the same district. such families occasionally meet in council, and unite for their common defence. it is no argument against savage man being a social animal, that the tribes inhabiting adjacent districts are almost always at war with each other; for the social instincts never extend to all the individuals of the same species. judging from the analogy of the majority of the quadrumana, it is probable that the early ape-like progenitors of man were likewise social; but this is not of much importance for us. although man, as he now exists, has few special instincts, having lost any which his early progenitors may have possessed, this is no reason why he should not have retained from an extremely remote period some degree of instinctive love and sympathy for his fellows. we are indeed all conscious that we do possess such sympathetic feelings (23. hume remarks ('an enquiry concerning the principles of morals,' edit. of 1751, p. 132), "there seems a necessity for confessing that the happiness and misery of others are not spectacles altogether indifferent to us, but that the view of the former...communicates a secret joy; the appearance of the latter... throws a melancholy damp over the imagination."); but our consciousness does not tell us whether they are instinctive, having originated long ago in the same manner as with the lower animals, or whether they have been acquired by each of us during our early years. as man is a social animal, it is almost certain that he would inherit a tendency to be faithful to his comrades, and obedient to the leader of his tribe; for these qualities are common to most social animals. he would consequently possess some capacity for self-command. he would from an inherited tendency be willing to defend, in concert with others, his fellow-men; and would be ready to aid them in any way, which did not too greatly interfere with his own welfare or his own strong desires. the social animals which stand at the bottom of the scale are guided almost exclusively, and those which stand higher in the scale are largely guided, by special instincts in the aid which they give to the members of the same community; but they are likewise in part impelled by mutual love and sympathy, assisted apparently by some amount of reason. although man, as just remarked, has no special instincts to tell him how to aid his fellow- men, he still has the impulse, and with his improved intellectual faculties would naturally be much guided in this respect by reason and experience. instinctive sympathy would also cause him to value highly the approbation of his fellows; for, as mr. bain has clearly shewn (24. 'mental and moral science,' 1868, p. 254.), the love of praise and the strong feeling of glory, and the still stronger horror of scorn and infamy, "are due to the workings of sympathy." consequently man would be influenced in the highest degree by the wishes, approbation, and blame of his fellow-men, as expressed by their gestures and language. thus the social instincts, which must have been acquired by man in a very rude state, and probably even by his early ape-like progenitors, still give the impulse to some of his best actions; but his actions are in a higher degree determined by the expressed wishes and judgment of his fellow-men, and unfortunately very often by his own strong selfish desires. but as love, sympathy and self-command become strengthened by habit, and as the power of reasoning becomes clearer, so that man can value justly the judgments of his fellows, he will feel himself impelled, apart from any transitory pleasure or pain, to certain lines of conduct. he might then declare--not that any barbarian or uncultivated man could thus think--i am the supreme judge of my own conduct, and in the words of kant, i will not in my own person violate the dignity of humanity. the more enduring social instincts conquer the less persistent instincts. we have not, however, as yet considered the main point, on which, from our present point of view, the whole question of the moral sense turns. why should a man feel that he ought to obey one instinctive desire rather than another? why is he bitterly regretful, if he has yielded to a strong sense of self-preservation, and has not risked his life to save that of a fellow- creature? or why does he regret having stolen food from hunger? it is evident in the first place, that with mankind the instinctive impulses have different degrees of strength; a savage will risk his own life to save that of a member of the same community, but will be wholly indifferent about a stranger: a young and timid mother urged by the maternal instinct will, without a moment's hesitation, run the greatest danger for her own infant, but not for a mere fellow-creature. nevertheless many a civilised man, or even boy, who never before risked his life for another, but full of courage and sympathy, has disregarded the instinct of self-preservation, and plunged at once into a torrent to save a drowning man, though a stranger. in this case man is impelled by the same instinctive motive, which made the heroic little american monkey, formerly described, save his keeper, by attacking the great and dreaded baboon. such actions as the above appear to be the simple result of the greater strength of the social or maternal instincts rather than that of any other instinct or motive; for they are performed too instantaneously for reflection, or for pleasure or pain to be felt at the time; though, if prevented by any cause, distress or even misery might be felt. in a timid man, on the other hand, the instinct of self-preservation might be so strong, that he would be unable to force himself to run any such risk, perhaps not even for his own child. i am aware that some persons maintain that actions performed impulsively, as in the above cases, do not come under the dominion of the moral sense, and cannot be called moral. they confine this term to actions done deliberately, after a victory over opposing desires, or when prompted by some exalted motive. but it appears scarcely possible to draw any clear line of distinction of this kind. (25. i refer here to the distinction between what has been called material and formal morality. i am glad to find that professor huxley ('critiques and addresses,' 1873, p. 287) takes the same view on this subject as i do. mr. leslie stephen remarks ('essays on freethinking and plain speaking,' 1873, p. 83), "the metaphysical distinction, between material and formal morality is as irrelevant as other such distinctions.") as far as exalted motives are concerned, many instances have been recorded of savages, destitute of any feeling of general benevolence towards mankind, and not guided by any religious motive, who have deliberately sacrificed their lives as prisoners(26. i have given one such case, namely of three patagonian indians who preferred being shot, one after the other, to betraying the plans of their companions in war ('journal of researches,' 1845, p. 103).), rather than betray their comrades; and surely their conduct ought to be considered as moral. as far as deliberation, and the victory over opposing motives are concerned, animals may be seen doubting between opposed instincts, in rescuing their offspring or comrades from danger; yet their actions, though done for the good of others, are not called moral. moreover, anything performed very often by us, will at last be done without deliberation or hesitation, and can then hardly be distinguished from an instinct; yet surely no one will pretend that such an action ceases to be moral. on the contrary, we all feel that an act cannot be considered as perfect, or as performed in the most noble manner, unless it be done impulsively, without deliberation or effort, in the same manner as by a man in whom the requisite qualities are innate. he who is forced to overcome his fear or want of sympathy before he acts, deserves, however, in one way higher credit than the man whose innate disposition leads him to a good act without effort. as we cannot distinguish between motives, we rank all actions of a certain class as moral, if performed by a moral being. a moral being is one who is capable of comparing his past and future actions or motives, and of approving or disapproving of them. we have no reason to suppose that any of the lower animals have this capacity; therefore, when a newfoundland dog drags a child out of the water, or a monkey faces danger to rescue its comrade, or takes charge of an orphan monkey, we do not call its conduct moral. but in the case of man, who alone can with certainty be ranked as a moral being, actions of a certain class are called moral, whether performed deliberately, after a struggle with opposing motives, or impulsively through instinct, or from the effects of slowly-gained habit. but to return to our more immediate subject. although some instincts are more powerful than others, and thus lead to corresponding actions, yet it is untenable, that in man the social instincts (including the love of praise and fear of blame) possess greater strength, or have, through long habit, acquired greater strength than the instincts of self-preservation, hunger, lust, vengeance, etc. why then does man regret, even though trying to banish such regret, that he has followed the one natural impulse rather than the other; and why does he further feel that he ought to regret his conduct? man in this respect differs profoundly from the lower animals. nevertheless we can, i think, see with some degree of clearness the reason of this difference. man, from the activity of his mental faculties, cannot avoid reflection: past impressions and images are incessantly and clearly passing through his mind. now with those animals which live permanently in a body, the social instincts are ever present and persistent. such animals are always ready to utter the danger-signal, to defend the community, and to give aid to their fellows in accordance with their habits; they feel at all times, without the stimulus of any special passion or desire, some degree of love and sympathy for them; they are unhappy if long separated from them, and always happy to be again in their company. so it is with ourselves. even when we are quite alone, how often do we think with pleasure or pain of what others think of us,--of their imagined approbation or disapprobation; and this all follows from sympathy, a fundamental element of the social instincts. a man who possessed no trace of such instincts would be an unnatural monster. on the other hand, the desire to satisfy hunger, or any passion such as vengeance, is in its nature temporary, and can for a time be fully satisfied. nor is it easy, perhaps hardly possible, to call up with complete vividness the feeling, for instance, of hunger; nor indeed, as has often been remarked, of any suffering. the instinct of self- preservation is not felt except in the presence of danger; and many a coward has thought himself brave until he has met his enemy face to face. the wish for another man's property is perhaps as persistent a desire as any that can be named; but even in this case the satisfaction of actual possession is generally a weaker feeling than the desire: many a thief, if not a habitual one, after success has wondered why he stole some article. (27. enmity or hatred seems also to be a highly persistent feeling, perhaps more so than any other that can be named. envy is defined as hatred of another for some excellence or success; and bacon insists (essay ix.), "of all other affections envy is the most importune and continual." dogs are very apt to hate both strange men and strange dogs, especially if they live near at hand, but do not belong to the same family, tribe, or clan; this feeling would thus seem to be innate, and is certainly a most persistent one. it seems to be the complement and converse of the true social instinct. from what we hear of savages, it would appear that something of the same kind holds good with them. if this be so, it would be a small step in any one to transfer such feelings to any member of the same tribe if he had done him an injury and had become his enemy. nor is it probable that the primitive conscience would reproach a man for injuring his enemy; rather it would reproach him, if he had not revenged himself. to do good in return for evil, to love your enemy, is a height of morality to which it may be doubted whether the social instincts would, by themselves, have ever led us. it is necessary that these instincts, together with sympathy, should have been highly cultivated and extended by the aid of reason, instruction, and the love or fear of god, before any such golden rule would ever be thought of and obeyed.) a man cannot prevent past impressions often repassing through his mind; he will thus be driven to make a comparison between the impressions of past hunger, vengeance satisfied, or danger shunned at other men's cost, with the almost ever-present instinct of sympathy, and with his early knowledge of what others consider as praiseworthy or blameable. this knowledge cannot be banished from his mind, and from instinctive sympathy is esteemed of great moment. he will then feel as if he had been baulked in following a present instinct or habit, and this with all animals causes dissatisfaction, or even misery. the above case of the swallow affords an illustration, though of a reversed nature, of a temporary though for the time strongly persistent instinct conquering another instinct, which is usually dominant over all others. at the proper season these birds seem all day long to be impressed with the desire to migrate; their habits change; they become restless, are noisy and congregate in flocks. whilst the mother-bird is feeding, or brooding over her nestlings, the maternal instinct is probably stronger than the migratory; but the instinct which is the more persistent gains the victory, and at last, at a moment when her young ones are not in sight, she takes flight and deserts them. when arrived at the end of her long journey, and the migratory instinct has ceased to act, what an agony of remorse the bird would feel, if, from being endowed with great mental activity, she could not prevent the image constantly passing through her mind, of her young ones perishing in the bleak north from cold and hunger. at the moment of action, man will no doubt be apt to follow the stronger impulse; and though this may occasionally prompt him to the noblest deeds, it will more commonly lead him to gratify his own desires at the expense of other men. but after their gratification when past and weaker impressions are judged by the ever-enduring social instinct, and by his deep regard for the good opinion of his fellows, retribution will surely come. he will then feel remorse, repentance, regret, or shame; this latter feeling, however, relates almost exclusively to the judgment of others. he will consequently resolve more or less firmly to act differently for the future; and this is conscience; for conscience looks backwards, and serves as a guide for the future. the nature and strength of the feelings which we call regret, shame, repentance or remorse, depend apparently not only on the strength of the violated instinct, but partly on the strength of the temptation, and often still more on the judgment of our fellows. how far each man values the appreciation of others, depends on the strength of his innate or acquired feeling of sympathy; and on his own capacity for reasoning out the remote consequences of his acts. another element is most important, although not necessary, the reverence or fear of the gods, or spirits believed in by each man: and this applies especially in cases of remorse. several critics have objected that though some slight regret or repentance may be explained by the view advocated in this chapter, it is impossible thus to account for the soul-shaking feeling of remorse. but i can see little force in this objection. my critics do not define what they mean by remorse, and i can find no definition implying more than an overwhelming sense of repentance. remorse seems to bear the same relation to repentance, as rage does to anger, or agony to pain. it is far from strange that an instinct so strong and so generally admired, as maternal love, should, if disobeyed, lead to the deepest misery, as soon as the impression of the past cause of disobedience is weakened. even when an action is opposed to no special instinct, merely to know that our friends and equals despise us for it is enough to cause great misery. who can doubt that the refusal to fight a duel through fear has caused many men an agony of shame? many a hindoo, it is said, has been stirred to the bottom of his soul by having partaken of unclean food. here is another case of what must, i think, be called remorse. dr. landor acted as a magistrate in west australia, and relates (28. 'insanity in relation to law,' ontario, united states, 1871, p. 1.), that a native on his farm, after losing one of his wives from disease, came and said that, "he was going to a distant tribe to spear a woman, to satisfy his sense of duty to his wife. i told him that if he did so, i would send him to prison for life. he remained about the farm for some months, but got exceedingly thin, and complained that he could not rest or eat, that his wife's spirit was haunting him, because he had not taken a life for hers. i was inexorable, and assured him that nothing should save him if he did." nevertheless the man disappeared for more than a year, and then returned in high condition; and his other wife told dr. landor that her husband had taken the life of a woman belonging to a distant tribe; but it was impossible to obtain legal evidence of the act. the breach of a rule held sacred by the tribe, will thus, as it seems, give rise to the deepest feelings,--and this quite apart from the social instincts, excepting in so far as the rule is grounded on the judgment of the community. how so many strange superstitions have arisen throughout the world we know not; nor can we tell how some real and great crimes, such as incest, have come to be held in an abhorrence (which is not however quite universal) by the lowest savages. it is even doubtful whether in some tribes incest would be looked on with greater horror, than would the marriage of a man with a woman bearing the same name, though not a relation. "to violate this law is a crime which the australians hold in the greatest abhorrence, in this agreeing exactly with certain tribes of north america. when the question is put in either district, is it worse to kill a girl of a foreign tribe, or to marry a girl of one's own, an answer just opposite to ours would be given without hesitation." (29. e.b. tylor, in 'contemporary review,' april 1873, p. 707.) we may, therefore, reject the belief, lately insisted on by some writers, that the abhorrence of incest is due to our possessing a special god-implanted conscience. on the whole it is intelligible, that a man urged by so powerful a sentiment as remorse, though arising as above explained, should be led to act in a manner, which he has been taught to believe serves as an expiation, such as delivering himself up to justice. man prompted by his conscience, will through long habit acquire such perfect self-command, that his desires and passions will at last yield instantly and without a struggle to his social sympathies and instincts, including his feeling for the judgment of his fellows. the still hungry, or the still revengeful man will not think of stealing food, or of wreaking his vengeance. it is possible, or as we shall hereafter see, even probable, that the habit of self-command may, like other habits, be inherited. thus at last man comes to feel, through acquired and perhaps inherited habit, that it is best for him to obey his more persistent impulses. the imperious word "ought" seems merely to imply the consciousness of the existence of a rule of conduct, however it may have originated. formerly it must have been often vehemently urged that an insulted gentleman ought to fight a duel. we even say that a pointer ought to point, and a retriever to retrieve game. if they fail to do so, they fail in their duty and act wrongly. if any desire or instinct leading to an action opposed to the good of others still appears, when recalled to mind, as strong as, or stronger than, the social instinct, a man will feel no keen regret at having followed it; but he will be conscious that if his conduct were known to his fellows, it would meet with their disapprobation; and few are so destitute of sympathy as not to feel discomfort when this is realised. if he has no such sympathy, and if his desires leading to bad actions are at the time strong, and when recalled are not over-mastered by the persistent social instincts, and the judgment of others, then he is essentially a bad man (30. dr. prosper despine, in his psychologie naturelle, 1868 (tom. i. p. 243; tom. ii. p. 169) gives many curious cases of the worst criminals, who apparently have been entirely destitute of conscience.); and the sole restraining motive left is the fear of punishment, and the conviction that in the long run it would be best for his own selfish interests to regard the good of others rather than his own. it is obvious that every one may with an easy conscience gratify his own desires, if they do not interfere with his social instincts, that is with the good of others; but in order to be quite free from self-reproach, or at least of anxiety, it is almost necessary for him to avoid the disapprobation, whether reasonable or not, of his fellow-men. nor must he break through the fixed habits of his life, especially if these are supported by reason; for if he does, he will assuredly feel dissatisfaction. he must likewise avoid the reprobation of the one god or gods in whom, according to his knowledge or superstition, he may believe; but in this case the additional fear of divine punishment often supervenes. the strictly social virtues at first alone regarded. the above view of the origin and nature of the moral sense, which tells us what we ought to do, and of the conscience which reproves us if we disobey it, accords well with what we see of the early and undeveloped condition of this faculty in mankind. the virtues which must be practised, at least generally, by rude men, so that they may associate in a body, are those which are still recognised as the most important. but they are practised almost exclusively in relation to the men of the same tribe; and their opposites are not regarded as crimes in relation to the men of other tribes. no tribe could hold together if murder, robbery, treachery, etc., were common; consequently such crimes within the limits of the same tribe "are branded with everlasting infamy" (31. see an able article in the 'north british review,' 1867, p. 395. see also mr. w. bagehot's articles on the importance of obedience and coherence to primitive man, in the 'fortnightly review,' 1867, p. 529, and 1868, p. 457, etc.); but excite no such sentiment beyond these limits. a north-american indian is well pleased with himself, and is honoured by others, when he scalps a man of another tribe; and a dyak cuts off the head of an unoffending person, and dries it as a trophy. the murder of infants has prevailed on the largest scale throughout the world (32. the fullest account which i have met with is by dr. gerland, in his 'ueber den aussterben der naturvölker,' 1868; but i shall have to recur to the subject of infanticide in a future chapter.), and has met with no reproach; but infanticide, especially of females, has been thought to be good for the tribe, or at least not injurious. suicide during former times was not generally considered as a crime (33. see the very interesting discussion on suicide in lecky's 'history of european morals,' vol. i. 1869, p. 223. with respect to savages, mr. winwood reade informs me that the negroes of west africa often commit suicide. it is well known how common it was amongst the miserable aborigines of south america after the spanish conquest. for new zealand, see the voyage of the novara, and for the aleutian islands, müller, as quoted by houzeau, 'les facultés mentales,' etc., tom. ii. p. 136.), but rather, from the courage displayed, as an honourable act; and it is still practised by some semi- civilised and savage nations without reproach, for it does not obviously concern others of the tribe. it has been recorded that an indian thug conscientiously regretted that he had not robbed and strangled as many travellers as did his father before him. in a rude state of civilisation the robbery of strangers is, indeed, generally considered as honourable. slavery, although in some ways beneficial during ancient times (34. see mr. bagehot, 'physics and politics,' 1872, p. 72.), is a great crime; yet it was not so regarded until quite recently, even by the most civilised nations. and this was especially the case, because the slaves belonged in general to a race different from that of their masters. as barbarians do not regard the opinion of their women, wives are commonly treated like slaves. most savages are utterly indifferent to the sufferings of strangers, or even delight in witnessing them. it is well known that the women and children of the north-american indians aided in torturing their enemies. some savages take a horrid pleasure in cruelty to animals (35. see, for instance, mr. hamilton's account of the kaffirs, 'anthropological review,' 1870, p. xv.), and humanity is an unknown virtue. nevertheless, besides the family affections, kindness is common, especially during sickness, between the members of the same tribe, and is sometimes extended beyond these limits. mungo park's touching account of the kindness of the negro women of the interior to him is well known. many instances could be given of the noble fidelity of savages towards each other, but not to strangers; common experience justifies the maxim of the spaniard, "never, never trust an indian." there cannot be fidelity without truth; and this fundamental virtue is not rare between the members of the same tribe: thus mungo park heard the negro women teaching their young children to love the truth. this, again, is one of the virtues which becomes so deeply rooted in the mind, that it is sometimes practised by savages, even at a high cost, towards strangers; but to lie to your enemy has rarely been thought a sin, as the history of modern diplomacy too plainly shews. as soon as a tribe has a recognised leader, disobedience becomes a crime, and even abject submission is looked at as a sacred virtue. as during rude times no man can be useful or faithful to his tribe without courage, this quality has universally been placed in the highest rank; and although in civilised countries a good yet timid man may be far more useful to the community than a brave one, we cannot help instinctively honouring the latter above a coward, however benevolent. prudence, on the other hand, which does not concern the welfare of others, though a very useful virtue, has never been highly esteemed. as no man can practise the virtues necessary for the welfare of his tribe without self-sacrifice, self- command, and the power of endurance, these qualities have been at all times highly and most justly valued. the american savage voluntarily submits to the most horrid tortures without a groan, to prove and strengthen his fortitude and courage; and we cannot help admiring him, or even an indian fakir, who, from a foolish religious motive, swings suspended by a hook buried in his flesh. the other so-called self-regarding virtues, which do not obviously, though they may really, affect the welfare of the tribe, have never been esteemed by savages, though now highly appreciated by civilised nations. the greatest intemperance is no reproach with savages. utter licentiousness, and unnatural crimes, prevail to an astounding extent. (36. mr. m'lennan has given ('primitive marriage,' 1865, p. 176) a good collection of facts on this head.) as soon, however, as marriage, whether polygamous, or monogamous, becomes common, jealousy will lead to the inculcation of female virtue; and this, being honoured, will tend to spread to the unmarried females. how slowly it spreads to the male sex, we see at the present day. chastity eminently requires self-command; therefore it has been honoured from a very early period in the moral history of civilised man. as a consequence of this, the senseless practice of celibacy has been ranked from a remote period as a virtue. (38. lecky, 'history of european morals,' vol. i. 1869, p. 109.) the hatred of indecency, which appears to us so natural as to be thought innate, and which is so valuable an aid to chastity, is a modern virtue, appertaining exclusively, as sir g. staunton remarks (38. 'embassy to china,' vol. ii. p. 348.), to civilised life. this is shewn by the ancient religious rites of various nations, by the drawings on the walls of pompeii, and by the practices of many savages. we have now seen that actions are regarded by savages, and were probably so regarded by primeval man, as good or bad, solely as they obviously affect the welfare of the tribe,--not that of the species, nor that of an individual member of the tribe. this conclusion agrees well with the belief that the so-called moral sense is aboriginally derived from the social instincts, for both relate at first exclusively to the community. the chief causes of the low morality of savages, as judged by our standard, are, firstly, the confinement of sympathy to the same tribe. secondly, powers of reasoning insufficient to recognise the bearing of many virtues, especially of the self-regarding virtues, on the general welfare of the tribe. savages, for instance, fail to trace the multiplied evils consequent on a want of temperance, chastity, etc. and, thirdly, weak power of self-command; for this power has not been strengthened through long-continued, perhaps inherited, habit, instruction and religion. i have entered into the above details on the immorality of savages (39. see on this subject copious evidence in chap. vii. of sir j. lubbock, 'origin of civilisation,' 1870.), because some authors have recently taken a high view of their moral nature, or have attributed most of their crimes to mistaken benevolence. (40. for instance lecky, 'history of european morals,' vol. i. p. 124.) these authors appear to rest their conclusion on savages possessing those virtues which are serviceable, or even necessary, for the existence of the family and of the tribe,--qualities which they undoubtedly do possess, and often in a high degree. concluding remarks. it was assumed formerly by philosophers of the derivative (41. this term is used in an able article in the 'westminster review,' oct. 1869, p. 498. for the "greatest happiness principle," see j.s. mill, 'utilitarianism,' p. 17.) school of morals that the foundation of morality lay in a form of selfishness; but more recently the "greatest happiness principle" has been brought prominently forward. it is, however, more correct to speak of the latter principle as the standard, and not as the motive of conduct. nevertheless, all the authors whose works i have consulted, with a few exceptions (42. mill recognises ('system of logic,' vol. ii. p. 422) in the clearest manner, that actions may be performed through habit without the anticipation of pleasure. mr. h. sidgwick also, in his essay on pleasure and desire ('the contemporary review,' april 1872, p. 671), remarks: "to sum up, in contravention of the doctrine that our conscious active impulses are always directed towards the production of agreeable sensations in ourselves, i would maintain that we find everywhere in consciousness extra-regarding impulse, directed towards something that is not pleasure; that in many cases the impulse is so far incompatible with the self-regarding that the two do not easily co-exist in the same moment of consciousness." a dim feeling that our impulses do not by any means always arise from any contemporaneous or anticipated pleasure, has, i cannot but think, been one chief cause of the acceptance of the intuitive theory of morality, and of the rejection of the utilitarian or "greatest happiness" theory. with respect to the latter theory the standard and the motive of conduct have no doubt often been confused, but they are really in some degree blended.), write as if there must be a distinct motive for every action, and that this must be associated with some pleasure or displeasure. but man seems often to act impulsively, that is from instinct or long habit, without any consciousness of pleasure, in the same manner as does probably a bee or ant, when it blindly follows its instincts. under circumstances of extreme peril, as during a fire, when a man endeavours to save a fellow-creature without a moment's hesitation, he can hardly feel pleasure; and still less has he time to reflect on the dissatisfaction which he might subsequently experience if he did not make the attempt. should he afterwards reflect over his own conduct, he would feel that there lies within him an impulsive power widely different from a search after pleasure or happiness; and this seems to be the deeply planted social instinct. in the case of the lower animals it seems much more appropriate to speak of their social instincts, as having been developed for the general good rather than for the general happiness of the species. the term, general good, may be defined as the rearing of the greatest number of individuals in full vigour and health, with all their faculties perfect, under the conditions to which they are subjected. as the social instincts both of man and the lower animals have no doubt been developed by nearly the same steps, it would be advisable, if found practicable, to use the same definition in both cases, and to take as the standard of morality, the general good or welfare of the community, rather than the general happiness; but this definition would perhaps require some limitation on account of political ethics. when a man risks his life to save that of a fellow-creature, it seems also more correct to say that he acts for the general good, rather than for the general happiness of mankind. no doubt the welfare and the happiness of the individual usually coincide; and a contented, happy tribe will flourish better than one that is discontented and unhappy. we have seen that even at an early period in the history of man, the expressed wishes of the community will have naturally influenced to a large extent the conduct of each member; and as all wish for happiness, the "greatest happiness principle" will have become a most important secondary guide and object; the social instinct, however, together with sympathy (which leads to our regarding the approbation and disapprobation of others), having served as the primary impulse and guide. thus the reproach is removed of laying the foundation of the noblest part of our nature in the base principle of selfishness; unless, indeed, the satisfaction which every animal feels, when it follows its proper instincts, and the dissatisfaction felt when prevented, be called selfish. the wishes and opinions of the members of the same community, expressed at first orally, but later by writing also, either form the sole guides of our conduct, or greatly reinforce the social instincts; such opinions, however, have sometimes a tendency directly opposed to these instincts. this latter fact is well exemplified by the law of honour, that is, the law of the opinion of our equals, and not of all our countrymen. the breach of this law, even when the breach is known to be strictly accordant with true morality, has caused many a man more agony than a real crime. we recognise the same influence in the burning sense of shame which most of us have felt, even after the interval of years, when calling to mind some accidental breach of a trifling, though fixed, rule of etiquette. the judgment of the community will generally be guided by some rude experience of what is best in the long run for all the members; but this judgment will not rarely err from ignorance and weak powers of reasoning. hence the strangest customs and superstitions, in complete opposition to the true welfare and happiness of mankind, have become all-powerful throughout the world. we see this in the horror felt by a hindoo who breaks his caste, and in many other such cases. it would be difficult to distinguish between the remorse felt by a hindoo who has yielded to the temptation of eating unclean food, from that felt after committing a theft; but the former would probably be the more severe. how so many absurd rules of conduct, as well as so many absurd religious beliefs, have originated, we do not know; nor how it is that they have become, in all quarters of the world, so deeply impressed on the mind of men; but it is worthy of remark that a belief constantly inculcated during the early years of life, whilst the brain is impressible, appears to acquire almost the nature of an instinct; and the very essence of an instinct is that it is followed independently of reason. neither can we say why certain admirable virtues, such as the love of truth, are much more highly appreciated by some savage tribes than by others (43. good instances are given by mr. wallace in 'scientific opinion,' sept. 15, 1869; and more fully in his 'contributions to the theory of natural selection,' 1870, p. 353.); nor, again, why similar differences prevail even amongst highly civilised nations. knowing how firmly fixed many strange customs and superstitions have become, we need feel no surprise that the self- regarding virtues, supported as they are by reason, should now appear to us so natural as to be thought innate, although they were not valued by man in his early condition. not withstanding many sources of doubt, man can generally and readily distinguish between the higher and lower moral rules. the higher are founded on the social instincts, and relate to the welfare of others. they are supported by the approbation of our fellow-men and by reason. the lower rules, though some of them when implying self-sacrifice hardly deserve to be called lower, relate chiefly to self, and arise from public opinion, matured by experience and cultivation; for they are not practised by rude tribes. as man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united into larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unknown to him. this point being once reached, there is only an artificial barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races. if, indeed, such men are separated from him by great differences in appearance or habits, experience unfortunately shews us how long it is, before we look at them as our fellow-creatures. sympathy beyond the confines of man, that is, humanity to the lower animals, seems to be one of the latest moral acquisitions. it is apparently unfelt by savages, except towards their pets. how little the old romans knew of it is shewn by their abhorrent gladiatorial exhibitions. the very idea of humanity, as far as i could observe, was new to most of the gauchos of the pampas. this virtue, one of the noblest with which man is endowed, seems to arise incidentally from our sympathies becoming more tender and more widely diffused, until they are extended to all sentient beings. as soon as this virtue is honoured and practised by some few men, it spreads through instruction and example to the young, and eventually becomes incorporated in public opinion. the highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognise that we ought to control our thoughts, and "not even in inmost thought to think again the sins that made the past so pleasant to us." (44. tennyson, idylls of the king, p. 244.) whatever makes any bad action familiar to the mind, renders its performance by so much the easier. as marcus aurelius long ago said, "such as are thy habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of thy mind; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts." (45. 'the thoughts of the emperor m. aurelius antoninus,' english translation, 2nd edit., 1869. p. 112. marcus aurelius was born a.d. 121.) our great philosopher, herbert spencer, has recently explained his views on the moral sense. he says (46. letter to mr. mill in bain's 'mental and moral science,' 1868, p. 722.), "i believe that the experiences of utility organised and consolidated through all past generations of the human race, have been producing corresponding modifications, which, by continued transmission and accumulation, have become in us certain faculties of moral intuition--certain emotions responding to right and wrong conduct, which have no apparent basis in the individual experiences of utility." there is not the least inherent improbability, as it seems to me, in virtuous tendencies being more or less strongly inherited; for, not to mention the various dispositions and habits transmitted by many of our domestic animals to their offspring, i have heard of authentic cases in which a desire to steal and a tendency to lie appeared to run in families of the upper ranks; and as stealing is a rare crime in the wealthy classes, we can hardly account by accidental coincidence for the tendency occurring in two or three members of the same family. if bad tendencies are transmitted, it is probable that good ones are likewise transmitted. that the state of the body by affecting the brain, has great influence on the moral tendencies is known to most of those who have suffered from chronic derangements of the digestion or liver. the same fact is likewise shewn by the "perversion or destruction of the moral sense being often one of the earliest symptoms of mental derangement" (47. maudsley, 'body and mind,' 1870, p. 60.); and insanity is notoriously often inherited. except through the principle of the transmission of moral tendencies, we cannot understand the differences believed to exist in this respect between the various races of mankind. even the partial transmission of virtuous tendencies would be an immense assistance to the primary impulse derived directly and indirectly from the social instincts. admitting for a moment that virtuous tendencies are inherited, it appears probable, at least in such cases as chastity, temperance, humanity to animals, etc., that they become first impressed on the mental organization through habit, instruction and example, continued during several generations in the same family, and in a quite subordinate degree, or not at all, by the individuals possessing such virtues having succeeded best in the struggle for life. my chief source of doubt with respect to any such inheritance, is that senseless customs, superstitions, and tastes, such as the horror of a hindoo for unclean food, ought on the same principle to be transmitted. i have not met with any evidence in support of the transmission of superstitious customs or senseless habits, although in itself it is perhaps not less probable than that animals should acquire inherited tastes for certain kinds of food or fear of certain foes. finally the social instincts, which no doubt were acquired by man as by the lower animals for the good of the community, will from the first have given to him some wish to aid his fellows, some feeling of sympathy, and have compelled him to regard their approbation and disapprobation. such impulses will have served him at a very early period as a rude rule of right and wrong. but as man gradually advanced in intellectual power, and was enabled to trace the more remote consequences of his actions; as he acquired sufficient knowledge to reject baneful customs and superstitions; as he regarded more and more, not only the welfare, but the happiness of his fellow-men; as from habit, following on beneficial experience, instruction and example, his sympathies became more tender and widely diffused, extending to men of all races, to the imbecile, maimed, and other useless members of society, and finally to the lower animals,--so would the standard of his morality rise higher and higher. and it is admitted by moralists of the derivative school and by some intuitionists, that the standard of morality has risen since an early period in the history of man. (48. a writer in the 'north british review' (july 1869, p. 531), well capable of forming a sound judgment, expresses himself strongly in favour of this conclusion. mr. lecky ('history of morals,' vol. i. p. 143) seems to a certain extent to coincide therein.) as a struggle may sometimes be seen going on between the various instincts of the lower animals, it is not surprising that there should be a struggle in man between his social instincts, with their derived virtues, and his lower, though momentarily stronger impulses or desires. this, as mr. galton (49. see his remarkable work on 'hereditary genius,' 1869, p. 349. the duke of argyll ('primeval man,' 1869, p. 188) has some good remarks on the contest in man's nature between right and wrong.) has remarked, is all the less surprising, as man has emerged from a state of barbarism within a comparatively recent period. after having yielded to some temptation we feel a sense of dissatisfaction, shame, repentance, or remorse, analogous to the feelings caused by other powerful instincts or desires, when left unsatisfied or baulked. we compare the weakened impression of a past temptation with the ever present social instincts, or with habits, gained in early youth and strengthened during our whole lives, until they have become almost as strong as instincts. if with the temptation still before us we do not yield, it is because either the social instinct or some custom is at the moment predominant, or because we have learnt that it will appear to us hereafter the stronger, when compared with the weakened impression of the temptation, and we realise that its violation would cause us suffering. looking to future generations, there is no cause to fear that the social instincts will grow weaker, and we may expect that virtuous habits will grow stronger, becoming perhaps fixed by inheritance. in this case the struggle between our higher and lower impulses will be less severe, and virtue will be triumphant. summary of the last two chapters. there can be no doubt that the difference between the mind of the lowest man and that of the highest animal is immense. an anthropomorphous ape, if he could take a dispassionate view of his own case, would admit that though he could form an artful plan to plunder a garden--though he could use stones for fighting or for breaking open nuts, yet that the thought of fashioning a stone into a tool was quite beyond his scope. still less, as he would admit, could he follow out a train of metaphysical reasoning, or solve a mathematical problem, or reflect on god, or admire a grand natural scene. some apes, however, would probably declare that they could and did admire the beauty of the coloured skin and fur of their partners in marriage. they would admit, that though they could make other apes understand by cries some of their perceptions and simpler wants, the notion of expressing definite ideas by definite sounds had never crossed their minds. they might insist that they were ready to aid their fellow-apes of the same troop in many ways, to risk their lives for them, and to take charge of their orphans; but they would be forced to acknowledge that disinterested love for all living creatures, the most noble attribute of man, was quite beyond their comprehension. nevertheless the difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind. we have seen that the senses and intuitions, the various emotions and faculties, such as love, memory, attention, curiosity, imitation, reason, etc., of which man boasts, may be found in an incipient, or even sometimes in a well-developed condition, in the lower animals. they are also capable of some inherited improvement, as we see in the domestic dog compared with the wolf or jackal. if it could be proved that certain high mental powers, such as the formation of general concepts, self-consciousness, etc., were absolutely peculiar to man, which seems extremely doubtful, it is not improbable that these qualities are merely the incidental results of other highly-advanced intellectual faculties; and these again mainly the result of the continued use of a perfect language. at what age does the new-born infant possess the power of abstraction, or become self-conscious, and reflect on its own existence? we cannot answer; nor can we answer in regard to the ascending organic scale. the half-art, half-instinct of language still bears the stamp of its gradual evolution. the ennobling belief in god is not universal with man; and the belief in spiritual agencies naturally follows from other mental powers. the moral sense perhaps affords the best and highest distinction between man and the lower animals; but i need say nothing on this head, as i have so lately endeavoured to shew that the social instincts,--the prime principle of man's moral constitution (50. 'the thoughts of marcus aurelius,' etc., p. 139.)--with the aid of active intellectual powers and the effects of habit, naturally lead to the golden rule, "as ye would that men should do to you, do ye to them likewise;" and this lies at the foundation of morality. in the next chapter i shall make some few remarks on the probable steps and means by which the several mental and moral faculties of man have been gradually evolved. that such evolution is at least possible, ought not to be denied, for we daily see these faculties developing in every infant; and we may trace a perfect gradation from the mind of an utter idiot, lower than that of an animal low in the scale, to the mind of a newton. chapter v. on the development of the intellectual and moral faculties during primeval and civilised times. advancement of the intellectual powers through natural selection-- importance of imitation--social and moral faculties--their development within the limits of the same tribe--natural selection as affecting civilised nations--evidence that civilised nations were once barbarous. the subjects to be discussed in this chapter are of the highest interest, but are treated by me in an imperfect and fragmentary manner. mr. wallace, in an admirable paper before referred to (1. anthropological review, may 1864, p. clviii.), argues that man, after he had partially acquired those intellectual and moral faculties which distinguish him from the lower animals, would have been but little liable to bodily modifications through natural selection or any other means. for man is enabled through his mental faculties "to keep with an unchanged body in harmony with the changing universe." he has great power of adapting his habits to new conditions of life. he invents weapons, tools, and various stratagems to procure food and to defend himself. when he migrates into a colder climate he uses clothes, builds sheds, and makes fires; and by the aid of fire cooks food otherwise indigestible. he aids his fellow-men in many ways, and anticipates future events. even at a remote period he practised some division of labour. the lower animals, on the other hand, must have their bodily structure modified in order to survive under greatly changed conditions. they must be rendered stronger, or acquire more effective teeth or claws, for defence against new enemies; or they must be reduced in size, so as to escape detection and danger. when they migrate into a colder climate, they must become clothed with thicker fur, or have their constitutions altered. if they fail to be thus modified, they will cease to exist. the case, however, is widely different, as mr. wallace has with justice insisted, in relation to the intellectual and moral faculties of man. these faculties are variable; and we have every reason to believe that the variations tend to be inherited. therefore, if they were formerly of high importance to primeval man and to his ape-like progenitors, they would have been perfected or advanced through natural selection. of the high importance of the intellectual faculties there can be no doubt, for man mainly owes to them his predominant position in the world. we can see, that in the rudest state of society, the individuals who were the most sagacious, who invented and used the best weapons or traps, and who were best able to defend themselves, would rear the greatest number of offspring. the tribes, which included the largest number of men thus endowed, would increase in number and supplant other tribes. numbers depend primarily on the means of subsistence, and this depends partly on the physical nature of the country, but in a much higher degree on the arts which are there practised. as a tribe increases and is victorious, it is often still further increased by the absorption of other tribes. (2. after a time the members or tribes which are absorbed into another tribe assume, as sir henry maine remarks ('ancient law,' 1861, p. 131), that they are the co-descendants of the same ancestors.) the stature and strength of the men of a tribe are likewise of some importance for its success, and these depend in part on the nature and amount of the food which can be obtained. in europe the men of the bronze period were supplanted by a race more powerful, and, judging from their sword-handles, with larger hands (3. morlot, 'soc. vaud. sc. nat.' 1860, p. 294.); but their success was probably still more due to their superiority in the arts. all that we know about savages, or may infer from their traditions and from old monuments, the history of which is quite forgotten by the present inhabitants, shew that from the remotest times successful tribes have supplanted other tribes. relics of extinct or forgotten tribes have been discovered throughout the civilised regions of the earth, on the wild plains of america, and on the isolated islands in the pacific ocean. at the present day civilised nations are everywhere supplanting barbarous nations, excepting where the climate opposes a deadly barrier; and they succeed mainly, though not exclusively, through their arts, which are the products of the intellect. it is, therefore, highly probable that with mankind the intellectual faculties have been mainly and gradually perfected through natural selection; and this conclusion is sufficient for our purpose. undoubtedly it would be interesting to trace the development of each separate faculty from the state in which it exists in the lower animals to that in which it exists in man; but neither my ability nor knowledge permits the attempt. it deserves notice that, as soon as the progenitors of man became social (and this probably occurred at a very early period), the principle of imitation, and reason, and experience would have increased, and much modified the intellectual powers in a way, of which we see only traces in the lower animals. apes are much given to imitation, as are the lowest savages; and the simple fact previously referred to, that after a time no animal can be caught in the same place by the same sort of trap, shews that animals learn by experience, and imitate the caution of others. now, if some one man in a tribe, more sagacious than the others, invented a new snare or weapon, or other means of attack or defence, the plainest self- interest, without the assistance of much reasoning power, would prompt the other members to imitate him; and all would thus profit. the habitual practice of each new art must likewise in some slight degree strengthen the intellect. if the new invention were an important one, the tribe would increase in number, spread, and supplant other tribes. in a tribe thus rendered more numerous there would always be a rather greater chance of the birth of other superior and inventive members. if such men left children to inherit their mental superiority, the chance of the birth of still more ingenious members would be somewhat better, and in a very small tribe decidedly better. even if they left no children, the tribe would still include their blood-relations; and it has been ascertained by agriculturists (4. i have given instances in my variation of animals under domestication, vol. ii. p. 196.) that by preserving and breeding from the family of an animal, which when slaughtered was found to be valuable, the desired character has been obtained. turning now to the social and moral faculties. in order that primeval men, or the ape-like progenitors of man, should become social, they must have acquired the same instinctive feelings, which impel other animals to live in a body; and they no doubt exhibited the same general disposition. they would have felt uneasy when separated from their comrades, for whom they would have felt some degree of love; they would have warned each other of danger, and have given mutual aid in attack or defence. all this implies some degree of sympathy, fidelity, and courage. such social qualities, the paramount importance of which to the lower animals is disputed by no one, were no doubt acquired by the progenitors of man in a similar manner, namely, through natural selection, aided by inherited habit. when two tribes of primeval man, living in the same country, came into competition, if (other circumstances being equal) the one tribe included a great number of courageous, sympathetic and faithful members, who were always ready to warn each other of danger, to aid and defend each other, this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other. let it be borne in mind how all- important in the never-ceasing wars of savages, fidelity and courage must be. the advantage which disciplined soldiers have over undisciplined hordes follows chiefly from the confidence which each man feels in his comrades. obedience, as mr. bagehot has well shewn (5. see a remarkable series of articles on 'physics and politics,' in the 'fortnightly review,' nov. 1867; april 1, 1868; july 1, 1869, since separately published.), is of the highest value, for any form of government is better than none. selfish and contentious people will not cohere, and without coherence nothing can be effected. a tribe rich in the above qualities would spread and be victorious over other tribes: but in the course of time it would, judging from all past history, be in its turn overcome by some other tribe still more highly endowed. thus the social and moral qualities would tend slowly to advance and be diffused throughout the world. but it may be asked, how within the limits of the same tribe did a large number of members first become endowed with these social and moral qualities, and how was the standard of excellence raised? it is extremely doubtful whether the offspring of the more sympathetic and benevolent parents, or of those who were the most faithful to their comrades, would be reared in greater numbers than the children of selfish and treacherous parents belonging to the same tribe. he who was ready to sacrifice his life, as many a savage has been, rather than betray his comrades, would often leave no offspring to inherit his noble nature. the bravest men, who were always willing to come to the front in war, and who freely risked their lives for others, would on an average perish in larger numbers than other men. therefore, it hardly seems probable, that the number of men gifted with such virtues, or that the standard of their excellence, could be increased through natural selection, that is, by the survival of the fittest; for we are not here speaking of one tribe being victorious over another. although the circumstances, leading to an increase in the number of those thus endowed within the same tribe, are too complex to be clearly followed out, we can trace some of the probable steps. in the first place, as the reasoning powers and foresight of the members became improved, each man would soon learn that if he aided his fellow-men, he would commonly receive aid in return. from this low motive he might acquire the habit of aiding his fellows; and the habit of performing benevolent actions certainly strengthens the feeling of sympathy which gives the first impulse to benevolent actions. habits, moreover, followed during many generations probably tend to be inherited. but another and much more powerful stimulus to the development of the social virtues, is afforded by the praise and the blame of our fellow-men. to the instinct of sympathy, as we have already seen, it is primarily due, that we habitually bestow both praise and blame on others, whilst we love the former and dread the latter when applied to ourselves; and this instinct no doubt was originally acquired, like all the other social instincts, through natural selection. at how early a period the progenitors of man in the course of their development, became capable of feeling and being impelled by, the praise or blame of their fellow- creatures, we cannot of course say. but it appears that even dogs appreciate encouragement, praise, and blame. the rudest savages feel the sentiment of glory, as they clearly shew by preserving the trophies of their prowess, by their habit of excessive boasting, and even by the extreme care which they take of their personal appearance and decorations; for unless they regarded the opinion of their comrades, such habits would be senseless. they certainly feel shame at the breach of some of their lesser rules, and apparently remorse, as shewn by the case of the australian who grew thin and could not rest from having delayed to murder some other woman, so as to propitiate his dead wife's spirit. though i have not met with any other recorded case, it is scarcely credible that a savage, who will sacrifice his life rather than betray his tribe, or one who will deliver himself up as a prisoner rather than break his parole (6. mr. wallace gives cases in his 'contributions to the theory of natural selection,' 1870, p. 354.), would not feel remorse in his inmost soul, if he had failed in a duty, which he held sacred. we may therefore conclude that primeval man, at a very remote period, was influenced by the praise and blame of his fellows. it is obvious, that the members of the same tribe would approve of conduct which appeared to them to be for the general good, and would reprobate that which appeared evil. to do good unto others--to do unto others as ye would they should do unto you--is the foundation-stone of morality. it is, therefore, hardly possible to exaggerate the importance during rude times of the love of praise and the dread of blame. a man who was not impelled by any deep, instinctive feeling, to sacrifice his life for the good of others, yet was roused to such actions by a sense of glory, would by his example excite the same wish for glory in other men, and would strengthen by exercise the noble feeling of admiration. he might thus do far more good to his tribe than by begetting offspring with a tendency to inherit his own high character. with increased experience and reason, man perceives the more remote consequences of his actions, and the self-regarding virtues, such as temperance, chastity, etc., which during early times are, as we have before seen, utterly disregarded, come to be highly esteemed or even held sacred. i need not, however, repeat what i have said on this head in the fourth chapter. ultimately our moral sense or conscience becomes a highly complex sentiment--originating in the social instincts, largely guided by the approbation of our fellow-men, ruled by reason, self-interest, and in later times by deep religious feelings, and confirmed by instruction and habit. it must not be forgotten that although a high standard of morality gives but a slight or no advantage to each individual man and his children over the other men of the same tribe, yet that an increase in the number of well-endowed men and an advancement in the standard of morality will certainly give an immense advantage to one tribe over another. a tribe including many members who, from possessing in a high degree the spirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage, and sympathy, were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good, would be victorious over most other tribes; and this would be natural selection. at all times throughout the world tribes have supplanted other tribes; and as morality is one important element in their success, the standard of morality and the number of well-endowed men will thus everywhere tend to rise and increase. it is, however, very difficult to form any judgment why one particular tribe and not another has been successful and has risen in the scale of civilisation. many savages are in the same condition as when first discovered several centuries ago. as mr. bagehot has remarked, we are apt to look at progress as normal in human society; but history refutes this. the ancients did not even entertain the idea, nor do the oriental nations at the present day. according to another high authority, sir henry maine (7. 'ancient law,' 1861, p. 22. for mr. bagehot's remarks, 'fortnightly review,' april 1, 1868, p. 452.), "the greatest part of mankind has never shewn a particle of desire that its civil institutions should be improved." progress seems to depend on many concurrent favourable conditions, far too complex to be followed out. but it has often been remarked, that a cool climate, from leading to industry and to the various arts, has been highly favourable thereto. the esquimaux, pressed by hard necessity, have succeeded in many ingenious inventions, but their climate has been too severe for continued progress. nomadic habits, whether over wide plains, or through the dense forests of the tropics, or along the shores of the sea, have in every case been highly detrimental. whilst observing the barbarous inhabitants of tierra del fuego, it struck me that the possession of some property, a fixed abode, and the union of many families under a chief, were the indispensable requisites for civilisation. such habits almost necessitate the cultivation of the ground; and the first steps in cultivation would probably result, as i have elsewhere shewn (8. 'the variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. i. p. 309.), from some such accident as the seeds of a fruit-tree falling on a heap of refuse, and producing an unusually fine variety. the problem, however, of the first advance of savages towards civilisation is at present much too difficult to be solved. natural selection as affecting civilised nations. i have hitherto only considered the advancement of man from a semi-human condition to that of the modern savage. but some remarks on the action of natural selection on civilised nations may be worth adding. this subject has been ably discussed by mr. w.r. greg (9. 'fraser's magazine,' sept. 1868, p. 353. this article seems to have struck many persons, and has given rise to two remarkable essays and a rejoinder in the 'spectator,' oct. 3rd and 17th, 1868. it has also been discussed in the 'quarterly journal of science,' 1869, p. 152, and by mr. lawson tait in the 'dublin quarterly journal of medical science,' feb. 1869, and by mr. e. ray lankester in his 'comparative longevity,' 1870, p. 128. similar views appeared previously in the 'australasian,' july 13, 1867. i have borrowed ideas from several of these writers.), and previously by mr. wallace and mr. galton. (10. for mr. wallace, see 'anthropological review,' as before cited. mr. galton in 'macmillan's magazine,' aug. 1865, p. 318; also his great work, 'hereditary genius,' 1870.) most of my remarks are taken from these three authors. with savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated; and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. we civilised men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination; we build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed, and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. there is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. thus the weak members of civilised societies propagate their kind. no one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. it is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man himself, hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed. the aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts, but subsequently rendered, in the manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused. nor could we check our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature. the surgeon may harden himself whilst performing an operation, for he knows that he is acting for the good of his patient; but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, with an overwhelming present evil. we must therefore bear the undoubtedly bad effects of the weak surviving and propagating their kind; but there appears to be at least one check in steady action, namely that the weaker and inferior members of society do not marry so freely as the sound; and this check might be indefinitely increased by the weak in body or mind refraining from marriage, though this is more to be hoped for than expected. in every country in which a large standing army is kept up, the finest young men are taken by the conscription or are enlisted. they are thus exposed to early death during war, are often tempted into vice, and are prevented from marrying during the prime of life. on the other hand the shorter and feebler men, with poor constitutions, are left at home, and consequently have a much better chance of marrying and propagating their kind. (11. prof. h. fick ('einfluss der naturwissenschaft auf das recht,' june 1872) has some good remarks on this head, and on other such points.) man accumulates property and bequeaths it to his children, so that the children of the rich have an advantage over the poor in the race for success, independently of bodily or mental superiority. on the other hand, the children of parents who are short-lived, and are therefore on an average deficient in health and vigour, come into their property sooner than other children, and will be likely to marry earlier, and leave a larger number of offspring to inherit their inferior constitutions. but the inheritance of property by itself is very far from an evil; for without the accumulation of capital the arts could not progress; and it is chiefly through their power that the civilised races have extended, and are now everywhere extending their range, so as to take the place of the lower races. nor does the moderate accumulation of wealth interfere with the process of selection. when a poor man becomes moderately rich, his children enter trades or professions in which there is struggle enough, so that the able in body and mind succeed best. the presence of a body of well-instructed men, who have not to labour for their daily bread, is important to a degree which cannot be over-estimated; as all high intellectual work is carried on by them, and on such work, material progress of all kinds mainly depends, not to mention other and higher advantages. no doubt wealth when very great tends to convert men into useless drones, but their number is never large; and some degree of elimination here occurs, for we daily see rich men, who happen to be fools or profligate, squandering away their wealth. primogeniture with entailed estates is a more direct evil, though it may formerly have been a great advantage by the creation of a dominant class, and any government is better than none. most eldest sons, though they may be weak in body or mind, marry, whilst the younger sons, however superior in these respects, do not so generally marry. nor can worthless eldest sons with entailed estates squander their wealth. but here, as elsewhere, the relations of civilised life are so complex that some compensatory checks intervene. the men who are rich through primogeniture are able to select generation after generation the more beautiful and charming women; and these must generally be healthy in body and active in mind. the evil consequences, such as they may be, of the continued preservation of the same line of descent, without any selection, are checked by men of rank always wishing to increase their wealth and power; and this they effect by marrying heiresses. but the daughters of parents who have produced single children, are themselves, as mr. galton (12. 'hereditary genius,' 1870, pp. 132-140.) has shewn, apt to be sterile; and thus noble families are continually cut off in the direct line, and their wealth flows into some side channel; but unfortunately this channel is not determined by superiority of any kind. although civilisation thus checks in many ways the action of natural selection, it apparently favours the better development of the body, by means of good food and the freedom from occasional hardships. this may be inferred from civilised men having been found, wherever compared, to be physically stronger than savages. (13. quatrefages, 'revue des cours scientifiques,' 1867-68, p. 659.) they appear also to have equal powers of endurance, as has been proved in many adventurous expeditions. even the great luxury of the rich can be but little detrimental; for the expectation of life of our aristocracy, at all ages and of both sexes, is very little inferior to that of healthy english lives in the lower classes. (14. see the fifth and sixth columns, compiled from good authorities, in the table given in mr. e.r. lankester's 'comparative longevity,' 1870, p. 115.) we will now look to the intellectual faculties. if in each grade of society the members were divided into two equal bodies, the one including the intellectually superior and the other the inferior, there can be little doubt that the former would succeed best in all occupations, and rear a greater number of children. even in the lowest walks of life, skill and ability must be of some advantage; though in many occupations, owing to the great division of labour, a very small one. hence in civilised nations there will be some tendency to an increase both in the number and in the standard of the intellectually able. but i do not wish to assert that this tendency may not be more than counterbalanced in other ways, as by the multiplication of the reckless and improvident; but even to such as these, ability must be some advantage. it has often been objected to views like the foregoing, that the most eminent men who have ever lived have left no offspring to inherit their great intellect. mr. galton says, "i regret i am unable to solve the simple question whether, and how far, men and women who are prodigies of genius are infertile. i have, however, shewn that men of eminence are by no means so." (15. 'hereditary genius,' 1870, p. 330.) great lawgivers, the founders of beneficent religions, great philosophers and discoverers in science, aid the progress of mankind in a far higher degree by their works than by leaving a numerous progeny. in the case of corporeal structures, it is the selection of the slightly better-endowed and the elimination of the slightly less well-endowed individuals, and not the preservation of strongly-marked and rare anomalies, that leads to the advancement of a species. (16. 'origin of species' (fifth edition, 1869), p. 104.) so it will be with the intellectual faculties, since the somewhat abler men in each grade of society succeed rather better than the less able, and consequently increase in number, if not otherwise prevented. when in any nation the standard of intellect and the number of intellectual men have increased, we may expect from the law of the deviation from an average, that prodigies of genius will, as shewn by mr. galton, appear somewhat more frequently than before. in regard to the moral qualities, some elimination of the worst dispositions is always in progress even in the most civilised nations. malefactors are executed, or imprisoned for long periods, so that they cannot freely transmit their bad qualities. melancholic and insane persons are confined, or commit suicide. violent and quarrelsome men often come to a bloody end. the restless who will not follow any steady occupation--and this relic of barbarism is a great check to civilisation (17. 'hereditary genius,' 1870, p. 347.)--emigrate to newly-settled countries; where they prove useful pioneers. intemperance is so highly destructive, that the expectation of life of the intemperate, at the age of thirty for instance, is only 13.8 years; whilst for the rural labourers of england at the same age it is 40.59 years. (18. e. ray lankester, 'comparative longevity,' 1870, p. 115. the table of the intemperate is from neison's 'vital statistics.' in regard to profligacy, see dr. farr, 'influence of marriage on mortality,' 'nat. assoc. for the promotion of social science,' 1858.) profligate women bear few children, and profligate men rarely marry; both suffer from disease. in the breeding of domestic animals, the elimination of those individuals, though few in number, which are in any marked manner inferior, is by no means an unimportant element towards success. this especially holds good with injurious characters which tend to reappear through reversion, such as blackness in sheep; and with mankind some of the worst dispositions, which occasionally without any assignable cause make their appearance in families, may perhaps be reversions to a savage state, from which we are not removed by very many generations. this view seems indeed recognised in the common expression that such men are the black sheep of the family. with civilised nations, as far as an advanced standard of morality, and an increased number of fairly good men are concerned, natural selection apparently effects but little; though the fundamental social instincts were originally thus gained. but i have already said enough, whilst treating of the lower races, on the causes which lead to the advance of morality, namely, the approbation of our fellow-men--the strengthening of our sympathies by habit--example and imitation--reason--experience, and even self-interest--instruction during youth, and religious feelings. a most important obstacle in civilised countries to an increase in the number of men of a superior class has been strongly insisted on by mr. greg and mr. galton (19. 'fraser's magazine,' sept. 1868, p. 353. 'macmillan's magazine,' aug. 1865, p. 318. the rev. f.w. farrar ('fraser's magazine,' aug. 1870, p. 264) takes a different view.), namely, the fact that the very poor and reckless, who are often degraded by vice, almost invariably marry early, whilst the careful and frugal, who are generally otherwise virtuous, marry late in life, so that they may be able to support themselves and their children in comfort. those who marry early produce within a given period not only a greater number of generations, but, as shewn by dr. duncan (20. 'on the laws of the fertility of women,' in 'transactions of the royal society,' edinburgh, vol. xxiv. p. 287; now published separately under the title of 'fecundity, fertility, and sterility,' 1871. see, also, mr. galton, 'hereditary genius,' pp. 352-357, for observations to the above effect.), they produce many more children. the children, moreover, that are borne by mothers during the prime of life are heavier and larger, and therefore probably more vigorous, than those born at other periods. thus the reckless, degraded, and often vicious members of society, tend to increase at a quicker rate than the provident and generally virtuous members. or as mr. greg puts the case: "the careless, squalid, unaspiring irishman multiplies like rabbits: the frugal, foreseeing, self-respecting, ambitious scot, stern in his morality, spiritual in his faith, sagacious and disciplined in his intelligence, passes his best years in struggle and in celibacy, marries late, and leaves few behind him. given a land originally peopled by a thousand saxons and a thousand celts--and in a dozen generations five-sixths of the population would be celts, but five- sixths of the property, of the power, of the intellect, would belong to the one-sixth of saxons that remained. in the eternal 'struggle for existence,' it would be the inferior and less favoured race that had prevailed--and prevailed by virtue not of its good qualities but of its faults." there are, however, some checks to this downward tendency. we have seen that the intemperate suffer from a high rate of mortality, and the extremely profligate leave few offspring. the poorest classes crowd into towns, and it has been proved by dr. stark from the statistics of ten years in scotland (21. 'tenth annual report of births, deaths, etc., in scotland,' 1867, p. xxix.), that at all ages the death-rate is higher in towns than in rural districts, "and during the first five years of life the town death-rate is almost exactly double that of the rural districts." as these returns include both the rich and the poor, no doubt more than twice the number of births would be requisite to keep up the number of the very poor inhabitants in the towns, relatively to those in the country. with women, marriage at too early an age is highly injurious; for it has been found in france that, "twice as many wives under twenty die in the year, as died out of the same number of the unmarried." the mortality, also, of husbands under twenty is "excessively high" (22. these quotations are taken from our highest authority on such questions, namely, dr. farr, in his paper 'on the influence of marriage on the mortality of the french people,' read before the nat. assoc. for the promotion of social science, 1858.), but what the cause of this may be, seems doubtful. lastly, if the men who prudently delay marrying until they can bring up their families in comfort, were to select, as they often do, women in the prime of life, the rate of increase in the better class would be only slightly lessened. it was established from an enormous body of statistics, taken during 1853, that the unmarried men throughout france, between the ages of twenty and eighty, die in a much larger proportion than the married: for instance, out of every 1000 unmarried men, between the ages of twenty and thirty, 11.3 annually died, whilst of the married, only 6.5 died. (23. dr. farr, ibid. the quotations given below are extracted from the same striking paper.) a similar law was proved to hold good, during the years 1863 and 1864, with the entire population above the age of twenty in scotland: for instance, out of every 1000 unmarried men, between the ages of twenty and thirty, 14.97 annually died, whilst of the married only 7.24 died, that is less than half. (24. i have taken the mean of the quinquennial means, given in 'the tenth annual report of births, deaths, etc., in scotland,' 1867. the quotation from dr. stark is copied from an article in the 'daily news,' oct. 17, 1868, which dr. farr considers very carefully written.) dr. stark remarks on this, "bachelorhood is more destructive to life than the most unwholesome trades, or than residence in an unwholesome house or district where there has never been the most distant attempt at sanitary improvement." he considers that the lessened mortality is the direct result of "marriage, and the more regular domestic habits which attend that state." he admits, however, that the intemperate, profligate, and criminal classes, whose duration of life is low, do not commonly marry; and it must likewise be admitted that men with a weak constitution, ill health, or any great infirmity in body or mind, will often not wish to marry, or will be rejected. dr. stark seems to have come to the conclusion that marriage in itself is a main cause of prolonged life, from finding that aged married men still have a considerable advantage in this respect over the unmarried of the same advanced age; but every one must have known instances of men, who with weak health during youth did not marry, and yet have survived to old age, though remaining weak, and therefore always with a lessened chance of life or of marrying. there is another remarkable circumstance which seems to support dr. stark's conclusion, namely, that widows and widowers in france suffer in comparison with the married a very heavy rate of mortality; but dr. farr attributes this to the poverty and evil habits consequent on the disruption of the family, and to grief. on the whole we may conclude with dr. farr that the lesser mortality of married than of unmarried men, which seems to be a general law, "is mainly due to the constant elimination of imperfect types, and to the skilful selection of the finest individuals out of each successive generation;" the selection relating only to the marriage state, and acting on all corporeal, intellectual, and moral qualities. (25. dr. duncan remarks ('fecundity, fertility, etc.' 1871, p. 334) on this subject: "at every age the healthy and beautiful go over from the unmarried side to the married, leaving the unmarried columns crowded with the sickly and unfortunate.") we may, therefore, infer that sound and good men who out of prudence remain for a time unmarried, do not suffer a high rate of mortality. if the various checks specified in the two last paragraphs, and perhaps others as yet unknown, do not prevent the reckless, the vicious and otherwise inferior members of society from increasing at a quicker rate than the better class of men, the nation will retrograde, as has too often occurred in the history of the world. we must remember that progress is no invariable rule. it is very difficult to say why one civilised nation rises, becomes more powerful, and spreads more widely, than another; or why the same nation progresses more quickly at one time than at another. we can only say that it depends on an increase in the actual number of the population, on the number of men endowed with high intellectual and moral faculties, as well as on their standard of excellence. corporeal structure appears to have little influence, except so far as vigour of body leads to vigour of mind. it has been urged by several writers that as high intellectual powers are advantageous to a nation, the old greeks, who stood some grades higher in intellect than any race that has ever existed (26. see the ingenious and original argument on this subject by mr. galton, 'hereditary genius,' pp. 340-342.), ought, if the power of natural selection were real, to have risen still higher in the scale, increased in number, and stocked the whole of europe. here we have the tacit assumption, so often made with respect to corporeal structures, that there is some innate tendency towards continued development in mind and body. but development of all kinds depends on many concurrent favourable circumstances. natural selection acts only tentatively. individuals and races may have acquired certain indisputable advantages, and yet have perished from failing in other characters. the greeks may have retrograded from a want of coherence between the many small states, from the small size of their whole country, from the practice of slavery, or from extreme sensuality; for they did not succumb until "they were enervated and corrupt to the very core." (27. mr. greg, 'fraser's magazine,' sept. 1868, p. 357.) the western nations of europe, who now so immeasurably surpass their former savage progenitors, and stand at the summit of civilisation, owe little or none of their superiority to direct inheritance from the old greeks, though they owe much to the written works of that wonderful people. who can positively say why the spanish nation, so dominant at one time, has been distanced in the race. the awakening of the nations of europe from the dark ages is a still more perplexing problem. at that early period, as mr. galton has remarked, almost all the men of a gentle nature, those given to meditation or culture of the mind, had no refuge except in the bosom of a church which demanded celibacy (28. 'hereditary genius,' 1870, pp. 357- 359. the rev. f.w. farrar ('fraser's magazine,' aug. 1870, p. 257) advances arguments on the other side. sir c. lyell had already ('principles of geology,' vol. ii. 1868, p. 489), in a striking passage called attention to the evil influence of the holy inquisition in having, through selection, lowered the general standard of intelligence in europe.); and this could hardly fail to have had a deteriorating influence on each successive generation. during this same period the holy inquisition selected with extreme care the freest and boldest men in order to burn or imprison them. in spain alone some of the best men--those who doubted and questioned, and without doubting there can be no progress--were eliminated during three centuries at the rate of a thousand a year. the evil which the catholic church has thus effected is incalculable, though no doubt counterbalanced to a certain, perhaps to a large, extent in other ways; nevertheless, europe has progressed at an unparalleled rate. the remarkable success of the english as colonists, compared to other european nations, has been ascribed to their "daring and persistent energy"; a result which is well illustrated by comparing the progress of the canadians of english and french extraction; but who can say how the english gained their energy? there is apparently much truth in the belief that the wonderful progress of the united states, as well as the character of the people, are the results of natural selection; for the more energetic, restless, and courageous men from all parts of europe have emigrated during the last ten or twelve generations to that great country, and have there succeeded best. (29. mr. galton, 'macmillan's magazine,' august 1865, p. 325. see also, 'nature,' 'on darwinism and national life,' dec. 1869, p. 184.) looking to the distant future, i do not think that the rev. mr. zincke takes an exaggerated view when he says (30. 'last winter in the united states,' 1868, p. 29.): "all other series of events--as that which resulted in the culture of mind in greece, and that which resulted in the empire of rome--only appear to have purpose and value when viewed in connection with, or rather as subsidiary to...the great stream of anglo- saxon emigration to the west." obscure as is the problem of the advance of civilisation, we can at least see that a nation which produced during a lengthened period the greatest number of highly intellectual, energetic, brave, patriotic, and benevolent men, would generally prevail over less favoured nations. natural selection follows from the struggle for existence; and this from a rapid rate of increase. it is impossible not to regret bitterly, but whether wisely is another question, the rate at which man tends to increase; for this leads in barbarous tribes to infanticide and many other evils, and in civilised nations to abject poverty, celibacy, and to the late marriages of the prudent. but as man suffers from the same physical evils as the lower animals, he has no right to expect an immunity from the evils consequent on the struggle for existence. had he not been subjected during primeval times to natural selection, assuredly he would never have attained to his present rank. since we see in many parts of the world enormous areas of the most fertile land capable of supporting numerous happy homes, but peopled only by a few wandering savages, it might be argued that the struggle for existence had not been sufficiently severe to force man upwards to his highest standard. judging from all that we know of man and the lower animals, there has always been sufficient variability in their intellectual and moral faculties, for a steady advance through natural selection. no doubt such advance demands many favourable concurrent circumstances; but it may well be doubted whether the most favourable would have sufficed, had not the rate of increase been rapid, and the consequent struggle for existence extremely severe. it even appears from what we see, for instance, in parts of s. america, that a people which may be called civilised, such as the spanish settlers, is liable to become indolent and to retrograde, when the conditions of life are very easy. with highly civilised nations continued progress depends in a subordinate degree on natural selection; for such nations do not supplant and exterminate one another as do savage tribes. nevertheless the more intelligent members within the same community will succeed better in the long run than the inferior, and leave a more numerous progeny, and this is a form of natural selection. the more efficient causes of progress seem to consist of a good education during youth whilst the brain is impressible, and of a high standard of excellence, inculcated by the ablest and best men, embodied in the laws, customs and traditions of the nation, and enforced by public opinion. it should, however, be borne in mind, that the enforcement of public opinion depends on our appreciation of the approbation and disapprobation of others; and this appreciation is founded on our sympathy, which it can hardly be doubted was originally developed through natural selection as one of the most important elements of the social instincts. (31. i am much indebted to mr. john morley for some good criticisms on this subject: see, also broca, 'les selections,' 'revue d'anthropologie,' 1872.) on the evidence that all civilised nations were once barbarous. the present subject has been treated in so full and admirable a manner by sir j. lubbock (32. 'on the origin of civilisation,' 'proceedings of the ethnological society,' nov. 26, 1867.), mr. tylor, mr. m'lennan, and others, that i need here give only the briefest summary of their results. the arguments recently advanced by the duke of argyll (33. 'primeval man,' 1869.) and formerly by archbishop whately, in favour of the belief that man came into the world as a civilised being, and that all savages have since undergone degradation, seem to me weak in comparison with those advanced on the other side. many nations, no doubt, have fallen away in civilisation, and some may have lapsed into utter barbarism, though on this latter head i have met with no evidence. the fuegians were probably compelled by other conquering hordes to settle in their inhospitable country, and they may have become in consequence somewhat more degraded; but it would be difficult to prove that they have fallen much below the botocudos, who inhabit the finest parts of brazil. the evidence that all civilised nations are the descendants of barbarians, consists, on the one side, of clear traces of their former low condition in still-existing customs, beliefs, language, etc.; and on the other side, of proofs that savages are independently able to raise themselves a few steps in the scale of civilisation, and have actually thus risen. the evidence on the first head is extremely curious, but cannot be here given: i refer to such cases as that of the art of enumeration, which, as mr. tylor clearly shews by reference to the words still used in some places, originated in counting the fingers, first of one hand and then of the other, and lastly of the toes. we have traces of this in our own decimal system, and in the roman numerals, where, after the v, which is supposed to be an abbreviated picture of a human hand, we pass on to vi, etc., when the other hand no doubt was used. so again, "when we speak of three-score and ten, we are counting by the vigesimal system, each score thus ideally made, standing for 20--for 'one man' as a mexican or carib would put it." (34. 'royal institution of great britain,' march 15, 1867. also, 'researches into the early history of mankind,' 1865.) according to a large and increasing school of philologists, every language bears the marks of its slow and gradual evolution. so it is with the art of writing, for letters are rudiments of pictorial representations. it is hardly possible to read mr. m'lennan's work (35. 'primitive marriage,' 1865. see, likewise, an excellent article, evidently by the same author, in the 'north british review,' july 1869. also, mr. l.h. morgan, 'a conjectural solution of the origin of the class. system of relationship,' in 'proc. american acad. of sciences,' vol. vii. feb. 1868. prof. schaaffhausen ('anthropolog. review,' oct. 1869, p. 373) remarks on "the vestiges of human sacrifices found both in homer and the old testament.") and not admit that almost all civilised nations still retain traces of such rude habits as the forcible capture of wives. what ancient nation, as the same author asks, can be named that was originally monogamous? the primitive idea of justice, as shewn by the law of battle and other customs of which vestiges still remain, was likewise most rude. many existing superstitions are the remnants of former false religious beliefs. the highest form of religion-- the grand idea of god hating sin and loving righteousness--was unknown during primeval times. turning to the other kind of evidence: sir j. lubbock has shewn that some savages have recently improved a little in some of their simpler arts. from the extremely curious account which he gives of the weapons, tools, and arts, in use amongst savages in various parts of the world, it cannot be doubted that these have nearly all been independent discoveries, excepting perhaps the art of making fire. (36. sir j. lubbock, 'prehistoric times,' 2nd edit. 1869, chaps. xv. and xvi. et passim. see also the excellent 9th chapter in tylor's 'early history of mankind,' 2nd edit., 1870.) the australian boomerang is a good instance of one such independent discovery. the tahitians when first visited had advanced in many respects beyond the inhabitants of most of the other polynesian islands. there are no just grounds for the belief that the high culture of the native peruvians and mexicans was derived from abroad (37. dr. f. müller has made some good remarks to this effect in the 'reise der novara: anthropolog. theil,' abtheil. iii. 1868, s. 127.); many native plants were there cultivated, and a few native animals domesticated. we should bear in mind that, judging from the small influence of most missionaries, a wandering crew from some semi-civilised land, if washed to the shores of america, would not have produced any marked effect on the natives, unless they had already become somewhat advanced. looking to a very remote period in the history of the world, we find, to use sir j. lubbock's well-known terms, a paleolithic and neolithic period; and no one will pretend that the art of grinding rough flint tools was a borrowed one. in all parts of europe, as far east as greece, in palestine, india, japan, new zealand, and africa, including egypt, flint tools have been discovered in abundance; and of their use the existing inhabitants retain no tradition. there is also indirect evidence of their former use by the chinese and ancient jews. hence there can hardly be a doubt that the inhabitants of these countries, which include nearly the whole civilised world, were once in a barbarous condition. to believe that man was aboriginally civilised and then suffered utter degradation in so many regions, is to take a pitiably low view of human nature. it is apparently a truer and more cheerful view that progress has been much more general than retrogression; that man has risen, though by slow and interrupted steps, from a lowly condition to the highest standard as yet attained by him in knowledge, morals and religion. chapter vi. on the affinities and genealogy of man. position of man in the animal series--the natural system genealogical-- adaptive characters of slight value--various small points of resemblance between man and the quadrumana--rank of man in the natural system-- birthplace and antiquity of man--absence of fossil connecting links--lower stages in the genealogy of man, as inferred, firstly from his affinities and secondly from his structure--early androgynous condition of the vertebrata--conclusion. even if it be granted that the difference between man and his nearest allies is as great in corporeal structure as some naturalists maintain, and although we must grant that the difference between them is immense in mental power, yet the facts given in the earlier chapters appear to declare, in the plainest manner, that man is descended from some lower form, notwithstanding that connecting-links have not hitherto been discovered. man is liable to numerous, slight, and diversified variations, which are induced by the same general causes, are governed and transmitted in accordance with the same general laws, as in the lower animals. man has multiplied so rapidly, that he has necessarily been exposed to struggle for existence, and consequently to natural selection. he has given rise to many races, some of which differ so much from each other, that they have often been ranked by naturalists as distinct species. his body is constructed on the same homological plan as that of other mammals. he passes through the same phases of embryological development. he retains many rudimentary and useless structures, which no doubt were once serviceable. characters occasionally make their re-appearance in him, which we have reason to believe were possessed by his early progenitors. if the origin of man had been wholly different from that of all other animals, these various appearances would be mere empty deceptions; but such an admission is incredible. these appearances, on the other hand, are intelligible, at least to a large extent, if man is the co-descendant with other mammals of some unknown and lower form. some naturalists, from being deeply impressed with the mental and spiritual powers of man, have divided the whole organic world into three kingdoms, the human, the animal, and the vegetable, thus giving to man a separate kingdom. (1. isidore geoffroy st.-hilaire gives a detailed account of the position assigned to man by various naturalists in their classifications: 'hist. nat. gen.' tom. ii. 1859, pp. 170-189.) spiritual powers cannot be compared or classed by the naturalist: but he may endeavour to shew, as i have done, that the mental faculties of man and the lower animals do not differ in kind, although immensely in degree. a difference in degree, however great, does not justify us in placing man in a distinct kingdom, as will perhaps be best illustrated by comparing the mental powers of two insects, namely, a coccus or scale-insect and an ant, which undoubtedly belong to the same class. the difference is here greater than, though of a somewhat different kind from, that between man and the highest mammal. the female coccus, whilst young, attaches itself by its proboscis to a plant; sucks the sap, but never moves again; is fertilised and lays eggs; and this is its whole history. on the other hand, to describe the habits and mental powers of worker-ants, would require, as pierre huber has shewn, a large volume; i may, however, briefly specify a few points. ants certainly communicate information to each other, and several unite for the same work, or for games of play. they recognise their fellow-ants after months of absence, and feel sympathy for each other. they build great edifices, keep them clean, close the doors in the evening, and post sentries. they make roads as well as tunnels under rivers, and temporary bridges over them, by clinging together. they collect food for the community, and when an object, too large for entrance, is brought to the nest, they enlarge the door, and afterwards build it up again. they store up seeds, of which they prevent the germination, and which, if damp, are brought up to the surface to dry. they keep aphides and other insects as milch-cows. they go out to battle in regular bands, and freely sacrifice their lives for the common weal. they emigrate according to a preconcerted plan. they capture slaves. they move the eggs of their aphides, as well as their own eggs and cocoons, into warm parts of the nest, in order that they may be quickly hatched; and endless similar facts could be given. (2. some of the most interesting facts ever published on the habits of ants are given by mr. belt, in his 'naturalist in nicaragua,' 1874. see also mr. moggridge's admirable work, 'harvesting ants,' etc., 1873, also 'l'instinct chez les insectes,' by m. george pouchet, 'revue des deux mondes,' feb. 1870, p. 682.) on the whole, the difference in mental power between an ant and a coccus is immense; yet no one has ever dreamed of placing these insects in distinct classes, much less in distinct kingdoms. no doubt the difference is bridged over by other insects; and this is not the case with man and the higher apes. but we have every reason to believe that the breaks in the series are simply the results of many forms having become extinct. professor owen, relying chiefly on the structure of the brain, has divided the mammalian series into four sub-classes. one of these he devotes to man; in another he places both the marsupials and the monotremata; so that he makes man as distinct from all other mammals as are these two latter groups conjoined. this view has not been accepted, as far as i am aware, by any naturalist capable of forming an independent judgment, and therefore need not here be further considered. we can understand why a classification founded on any single character or organ--even an organ so wonderfully complex and important as the brain--or on the high development of the mental faculties, is almost sure to prove unsatisfactory. this principle has indeed been tried with hymenopterous insects; but when thus classed by their habits or instincts, the arrangement proved thoroughly artificial. (3. westwood, 'modern classification of insects,' vol. ii. 1840, p. 87.) classifications may, of course, be based on any character whatever, as on size, colour, or the element inhabited; but naturalists have long felt a profound conviction that there is a natural system. this system, it is now generally admitted, must be, as far as possible, genealogical in arrangement,--that is, the co- descendants of the same form must be kept together in one group, apart from the co-descendants of any other form; but if the parent-forms are related, so will be their descendants, and the two groups together will form a larger group. the amount of difference between the several groups--that is the amount of modification which each has undergone--is expressed by such terms as genera, families, orders, and classes. as we have no record of the lines of descent, the pedigree can be discovered only by observing the degrees of resemblance between the beings which are to be classed. for this object numerous points of resemblance are of much more importance than the amount of similarity or dissimilarity in a few points. if two languages were found to resemble each other in a multitude of words and points of construction, they would be universally recognised as having sprung from a common source, notwithstanding that they differed greatly in some few words or points of construction. but with organic beings the points of resemblance must not consist of adaptations to similar habits of life: two animals may, for instance, have had their whole frames modified for living in the water, and yet they will not be brought any nearer to each other in the natural system. hence we can see how it is that resemblances in several unimportant structures, in useless and rudimentary organs, or not now functionally active, or in an embryological condition, are by far the most serviceable for classification; for they can hardly be due to adaptations within a late period; and thus they reveal the old lines of descent or of true affinity. we can further see why a great amount of modification in some one character ought not to lead us to separate widely any two organisms. a part which already differs much from the same part in other allied forms has already, according to the theory of evolution, varied much; consequently it would (as long as the organism remained exposed to the same exciting conditions) be liable to further variations of the same kind; and these, if beneficial, would be preserved, and thus be continually augmented. in many cases the continued development of a part, for instance, of the beak of a bird, or of the teeth of a mammal, would not aid the species in gaining its food, or for any other object; but with man we can see no definite limit to the continued development of the brain and mental faculties, as far as advantage is concerned. therefore in determining the position of man in the natural or genealogical system, the extreme development of his brain ought not to outweigh a multitude of resemblances in other less important or quite unimportant points. the greater number of naturalists who have taken into consideration the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed blumenbach and cuvier, and have placed man in a separate order, under the title of the bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the quadrumana, carnivora, etc. recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same order with the quadrumana, under the title of the primates. the justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly-marked differences between the skulls of man and the quadrumana (lately insisted upon by bischoff, aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. in the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. the family of seals offers a good illustration of the small importance of adaptive characters for classification. these animals differ from all other carnivora in the form of their bodies and in the structure of their limbs, far more than does man from the higher apes; yet in most systems, from that of cuvier to the most recent one by mr. flower (4. 'proceedings zoological society,' 1863, p. 4.), seals are ranked as a mere family in the order of the carnivora. if man had not been his own classifier, he would never have thought of founding a separate order for his own reception. it would be beyond my limits, and quite beyond my knowledge, even to name the innumerable points of structure in which man agrees with the other primates. our great anatomist and philosopher, prof. huxley, has fully discussed this subject (5. 'evidence as to man's place in nature,' 1863, p. 70, et passim.), and concludes that man in all parts of his organization differs less from the higher apes, than these do from the lower members of the same group. consequently there "is no justification for placing man in a distinct order." in an early part of this work i brought forward various facts, shewing how closely man agrees in constitution with the higher mammals; and this agreement must depend on our close similarity in minute structure and chemical composition. i gave, as instances, our liability to the same diseases, and to the attacks of allied parasites; our tastes in common for the same stimulants, and the similar effects produced by them, as well as by various drugs, and other such facts. as small unimportant points of resemblance between man and the quadrumana are not commonly noticed in systematic works, and as, when numerous, they clearly reveal our relationship, i will specify a few such points. the relative position of our features is manifestly the same; and the various emotions are displayed by nearly similar movements of the muscles and skin, chiefly above the eyebrows and round the mouth. some few expressions are, indeed, almost the same, as in the weeping of certain kinds of monkeys and in the laughing noise made by others, during which the corners of the mouth are drawn backwards, and the lower eyelids wrinkled. the external ears are curiously alike. in man the nose is much more prominent than in most monkeys; but we may trace the commencement of an aquiline curvature in the nose of the hoolock gibbon; and this in the semnopithecus nasica is carried to a ridiculous extreme. the faces of many monkeys are ornamented with beards, whiskers, or moustaches. the hair on the head grows to a great length in some species of semnopithecus (6. isidore geoffroy st.-hilaire, 'hist. nat. gen.' tom. ii. 1859, p. 217.); and in the bonnet monkey (macacus radiatus) it radiates from a point on the crown, with a parting down the middle. it is commonly said that the forehead gives to man his noble and intellectual appearance; but the thick hair on the head of the bonnet monkey terminates downwards abruptly, and is succeeded by hair so short and fine that at a little distance the forehead, with the exception of the eyebrows, appears quite naked. it has been erroneously asserted that eyebrows are not present in any monkey. in the species just named the degree of nakedness of the forehead differs in different individuals; and eschricht states (7. 'über die richtung der haare,' etc., müller's 'archiv fur anat. und phys.' 1837, s. 51.) that in our children the limit between the hairy scalp and the naked forehead is sometimes not well defined; so that here we seem to have a trifling case of reversion to a progenitor, in whom the forehead had not as yet become quite naked. it is well known that the hair on our arms tends to converge from above and below to a point at the elbow. this curious arrangement, so unlike that in most of the lower mammals, is common to the gorilla, chimpanzee, orang, some species of hylobates, and even to some few american monkeys. but in hylobates agilis the hair on the fore-arm is directed downwards or towards the wrist in the ordinary manner; and in h. lar it is nearly erect, with only a very slight forward inclination; so that in this latter species it is in a transitional state. it can hardly be doubted that with most mammals the thickness of the hair on the back and its direction, is adapted to throw off the rain; even the transverse hairs on the fore-legs of a dog may serve for this end when he is coiled up asleep. mr. wallace, who has carefully studied the habits of the orang, remarks that the convergence of the hair towards the elbow on the arms of the orang may be explained as serving to throw off the rain, for this animal during rainy weather sits with its arms bent, and with the hands clasped round a branch or over its head. according to livingstone, the gorilla also "sits in pelting rain with his hands over his head." (8. quoted by reade, 'the african sketch book,' vol i. 1873, p. 152.) if the above explanation is correct, as seems probable, the direction of the hair on our own arms offers a curious record of our former state; for no one supposes that it is now of any use in throwing off the rain; nor, in our present erect condition, is it properly directed for this purpose. it would, however, be rash to trust too much to the principle of adaptation in regard to the direction of the hair in man or his early progenitors; for it is impossible to study the figures given by eschricht of the arrangement of the hair on the human foetus (this being the same as in the adult) and not agree with this excellent observer that other and more complex causes have intervened. the points of convergence seem to stand in some relation to those points in the embryo which are last closed in during development. there appears, also, to exist some relation between the arrangement of the hair on the limbs, and the course of the medullary arteries. (9. on the hair in hylobates, see 'natural history of mammals,' by c.l. martin, 1841, p. 415. also, isidore geoffroy on the american monkeys and other kinds, 'hist. nat. gen.' vol. ii. 1859, pp. 216, 243. eschricht, ibid. s. 46, 55, 61. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 619. wallace, 'contributions to the theory of natural selection,' 1870, p. 344.) it must not be supposed that the resemblances between man and certain apes in the above and in many other points--such as in having a naked forehead, long tresses on the head, etc.,--are all necessarily the result of unbroken inheritance from a common progenitor, or of subsequent reversion. many of these resemblances are more probably due to analogous variation, which follows, as i have elsewhere attempted to shew (10. 'origin of species,' 5th edit. 1869, p.194. 'the variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. 1868, p. 348.), from co-descended organisms having a similar constitution, and having been acted on by like causes inducing similar modifications. with respect to the similar direction of the hair on the fore-arms of man and certain monkeys, as this character is common to almost all the anthropomorphous apes, it may probably be attributed to inheritance; but this is not certain, as some very distinct american monkeys are thus characterised. although, as we have now seen, man has no just right to form a separate order for his own reception, he may perhaps claim a distinct sub-order or family. prof. huxley, in his last work (11. 'an introduction to the classification of animals,' 1869, p. 99.), divides the primates into three sub-orders; namely, the anthropidae with man alone, the simiadae including monkeys of all kinds, and the lemuridae with the diversified genera of lemurs. as far as differences in certain important points of structure are concerned, man may no doubt rightly claim the rank of a sub-order; and this rank is too low, if we look chiefly to his mental faculties. nevertheless, from a genealogical point of view it appears that this rank is too high, and that man ought to form merely a family, or possibly even only a sub- family. if we imagine three lines of descent proceeding from a common stock, it is quite conceivable that two of them might after the lapse of ages be so slightly changed as still to remain as species of the same genus, whilst the third line might become so greatly modified as to deserve to rank as a distinct sub-family, family, or even order. but in this case it is almost certain that the third line would still retain through inheritance numerous small points of resemblance with the other two. here, then, would occur the difficulty, at present insoluble, how much weight we ought to assign in our classifications to strongly-marked differences in some few points,--that is, to the amount of modification undergone; and how much to close resemblance in numerous unimportant points, as indicating the lines of descent or genealogy. to attach much weight to the few but strong differences is the most obvious and perhaps the safest course, though it appears more correct to pay great attention to the many small resemblances, as giving a truly natural classification. in forming a judgment on this head with reference to man, we must glance at the classification of the simiadae. this family is divided by almost all naturalists into the catarrhine group, or old world monkeys, all of which are characterised (as their name expresses) by the peculiar structure of their nostrils, and by having four premolars in each jaw; and into the platyrrhine group or new world monkeys (including two very distinct sub- groups), all of which are characterised by differently constructed nostrils, and by having six premolars in each jaw. some other small differences might be mentioned. now man unquestionably belongs in his dentition, in the structure of his nostrils, and some other respects, to the catarrhine or old world division; nor does he resemble the platyrrhines more closely than the catarrhines in any characters, excepting in a few of not much importance and apparently of an adaptive nature. it is therefore against all probability that some new world species should have formerly varied and produced a man-like creature, with all the distinctive characters proper to the old world division; losing at the same time all its own distinctive characters. there can, consequently, hardly be a doubt that man is an off-shoot from the old world simian stem; and that under a genealogical point of view he must be classed with the catarrhine division. (12. this is nearly the same classification as that provisionally adopted by mr. st. george mivart, ('transactions, philosophical society," 1867, p. 300), who, after separating the lemuridae, divides the remainder of the primates into the hominidae, the simiadae which answer to the catarrhines, the cebidae, and the hapalidae,--these two latter groups answering to the platyrrhines. mr. mivart still abides by the same view; see 'nature,' 1871, p. 481.) the anthropomorphous apes, namely the gorilla, chimpanzee, orang, and hylobates, are by most naturalists separated from the other old world monkeys, as a distinct sub-group. i am aware that gratiolet, relying on the structure of the brain, does not admit the existence of this sub-group, and no doubt it is a broken one. thus the orang, as mr. st. g. mivart remarks, "is one of the most peculiar and aberrant forms to be found in the order." (13. 'transactions, zoolog. soc.' vol. vi. 1867, p. 214.) the remaining non-anthropomorphous old world monkeys, are again divided by some naturalists into two or three smaller sub-groups; the genus semnopithecus, with its peculiar sacculated stomach, being the type of one sub-group. but it appears from m. gaudry's wonderful discoveries in attica, that during the miocene period a form existed there, which connected semnopithecus and macacus; and this probably illustrates the manner in which the other and higher groups were once blended together. if the anthropomorphous apes be admitted to form a natural sub-group, then as man agrees with them, not only in all those characters which he possesses in common with the whole catarrhine group, but in other peculiar characters, such as the absence of a tail and of callosities, and in general appearance, we may infer that some ancient member of the anthropomorphous sub-group gave birth to man. it is not probable that, through the law of analogous variation, a member of one of the other lower sub-groups should have given rise to a man-like creature, resembling the higher anthropomorphous apes in so many respects. no doubt man, in comparison with most of his allies, has undergone an extraordinary amount of modification, chiefly in consequence of the great development of his brain and his erect position; nevertheless, we should bear in mind that he "is but one of several exceptional forms of primates." (14. mr. st. g. mivart, 'transactions of the philosophical society,' 1867, p. 410.) every naturalist, who believes in the principle of evolution, will grant that the two main divisions of the simiadae, namely the catarrhine and platyrrhine monkeys, with their sub-groups, have all proceeded from some one extremely ancient progenitor. the early descendants of this progenitor, before they had diverged to any considerable extent from each other, would still have formed a single natural group; but some of the species or incipient genera would have already begun to indicate by their diverging characters the future distinctive marks of the catarrhine and platyrrhine divisions. hence the members of this supposed ancient group would not have been so uniform in their dentition, or in the structure of their nostrils, as are the existing catarrhine monkeys in one way and the platyrrhines in another way, but would have resembled in this respect the allied lemuridae, which differ greatly from each other in the form of their muzzles (15. messrs. murie and mivart on the lemuroidea, 'transactions, zoological society,' vol. vii, 1869, p. 5.), and to an extraordinary degree in their dentition. the catarrhine and platyrrhine monkeys agree in a multitude of characters, as is shewn by their unquestionably belonging to one and the same order. the many characters which they possess in common can hardly have been independently acquired by so many distinct species; so that these characters must have been inherited. but a naturalist would undoubtedly have ranked as an ape or a monkey, an ancient form which possessed many characters common to the catarrhine and platyrrhine monkeys, other characters in an intermediate condition, and some few, perhaps, distinct from those now found in either group. and as man from a genealogical point of view belongs to the catarrhine or old world stock, we must conclude, however much the conclusion may revolt our pride, that our early progenitors would have been properly thus designated. (16. haeckel has come to this same conclusion. see 'über die entstehung des menschengeschlechts,' in virchow's 'sammlung. gemein. wissen. vorträge,' 1868, s. 61. also his 'natürliche schöpfungsgeschichte,' 1868, in which he gives in detail his views on the genealogy of man.) but we must not fall into the error of supposing that the early progenitor of the whole simian stock, including man, was identical with, or even closely resembled, any existing ape or monkey. on the birthplace and antiquity of man. we are naturally led to enquire, where was the birthplace of man at that stage of descent when our progenitors diverged from the catarrhine stock? the fact that they belonged to this stock clearly shews that they inhabited the old world; but not australia nor any oceanic island, as we may infer from the laws of geographical distribution. in each great region of the world the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region. it is therefore probable that africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee; and as these two species are now man's nearest allies, it is somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the african continent than elsewhere. but it is useless to speculate on this subject; for two or three anthropomorphous apes, one the dryopithecus (17. dr. c. forsyth major, 'sur les singes fossiles trouvés en italie:' 'soc. ital. des sc. nat.' tom. xv. 1872.) of lartet, nearly as large as a man, and closely allied to hylobates, existed in europe during the miocene age; and since so remote a period the earth has certainly undergone many great revolutions, and there has been ample time for migration on the largest scale. at the period and place, whenever and wherever it was, when man first lost his hairy covering, he probably inhabited a hot country; a circumstance favourable for the frugiferous diet on which, judging from analogy, he subsisted. we are far from knowing how long ago it was when man first diverged from the catarrhine stock; but it may have occurred at an epoch as remote as the eocene period; for that the higher apes had diverged from the lower apes as early as the upper miocene period is shewn by the existence of the dryopithecus. we are also quite ignorant at how rapid a rate organisms, whether high or low in the scale, may be modified under favourable circumstances; we know, however, that some have retained the same form during an enormous lapse of time. from what we see going on under domestication, we learn that some of the co-descendants of the same species may be not at all, some a little, and some greatly changed, all within the same period. thus it may have been with man, who has undergone a great amount of modification in certain characters in comparison with the higher apes. the great break in the organic chain between man and his nearest allies, which cannot be bridged over by any extinct or living species, has often been advanced as a grave objection to the belief that man is descended from some lower form; but this objection will not appear of much weight to those who, from general reasons, believe in the general principle of evolution. breaks often occur in all parts of the series, some being wide, sharp and defined, others less so in various degrees; as between the orang and its nearest allies--between the tarsius and the other lemuridae--between the elephant, and in a more striking manner between the ornithorhynchus or echidna, and all other mammals. but these breaks depend merely on the number of related forms which have become extinct. at some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world. at the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as professor schaaffhausen has remarked (18. 'anthropological review,' april 1867, p. 236.), will no doubt be exterminated. the break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilised state, as we may hope, even than the caucasian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now between the negro or australian and the gorilla. with respect to the absence of fossil remains, serving to connect man with his ape-like progenitors, no one will lay much stress on this fact who reads sir c. lyell's discussion (19. 'elements of geology,' 1865, pp. 583- 585. 'antiquity of man,' 1863, p. 145.), where he shews that in all the vertebrate classes the discovery of fossil remains has been a very slow and fortuitous process. nor should it be forgotten that those regions which are the most likely to afford remains connecting man with some extinct ape- like creature, have not as yet been searched by geologists. lower stages in the genealogy of man. we have seen that man appears to have diverged from the catarrhine or old world division of the simiadae, after these had diverged from the new world division. we will now endeavour to follow the remote traces of his genealogy, trusting principally to the mutual affinities between the various classes and orders, with some slight reference to the periods, as far as ascertained, of their successive appearance on the earth. the lemuridae stand below and near to the simiadae, and constitute a very distinct family of the primates, or, according to haeckel and others, a distinct order. this group is diversified and broken to an extraordinary degree, and includes many aberrant forms. it has, therefore, probably suffered much extinction. most of the remnants survive on islands, such as madagascar and the malayan archipelago, where they have not been exposed to so severe a competition as they would have been on well-stocked continents. this group likewise presents many gradations, leading, as huxley remarks (20. 'man's place in nature,' p. 105.), "insensibly from the crown and summit of the animal creation down to creatures from which there is but a step, as it seems, to the lowest, smallest, and least intelligent of the placental mammalia." from these various considerations it is probable that the simiadae were originally developed from the progenitors of the existing lemuridae; and these in their turn from forms standing very low in the mammalian series. the marsupials stand in many important characters below the placental mammals. they appeared at an earlier geological period, and their range was formerly much more extensive than at present. hence the placentata are generally supposed to have been derived from the implacentata or marsupials; not, however, from forms closely resembling the existing marsupials, but from their early progenitors. the monotremata are plainly allied to the marsupials, forming a third and still lower division in the great mammalian series. they are represented at the present day solely by the ornithorhynchus and echidna; and these two forms may be safely considered as relics of a much larger group, representatives of which have been preserved in australia through some favourable concurrence of circumstances. the monotremata are eminently interesting, as leading in several important points of structure towards the class of reptiles. in attempting to trace the genealogy of the mammalia, and therefore of man, lower down in the series, we become involved in greater and greater obscurity; but as a most capable judge, mr. parker, has remarked, we have good reason to believe, that no true bird or reptile intervenes in the direct line of descent. he who wishes to see what ingenuity and knowledge can effect, may consult prof. haeckel's works. (21. elaborate tables are given in his 'generelle morphologie' (b. ii. s. cliii. and s. 425); and with more especial reference to man in his 'natürliche schöpfungsgeschichte,' 1868. prof. huxley, in reviewing this latter work ('the academy,' 1869, p. 42) says, that he considers the phylum or lines of descent of the vertebrata to be admirably discussed by haeckel, although he differs on some points. he expresses, also, his high estimate of the general tenor and spirit of the whole work.) i will content myself with a few general remarks. every evolutionist will admit that the five great vertebrate classes, namely, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes, are descended from some one prototype; for they have much in common, especially during their embryonic state. as the class of fishes is the most lowly organised, and appeared before the others, we may conclude that all the members of the vertebrate kingdom are derived from some fishlike animal. the belief that animals so distinct as a monkey, an elephant, a humming-bird, a snake, a frog, and a fish, etc., could all have sprung from the same parents, will appear monstrous to those who have not attended to the recent progress of natural history. for this belief implies the former existence of links binding closely together all these forms, now so utterly unlike. nevertheless, it is certain that groups of animals have existed, or do now exist, which serve to connect several of the great vertebrate classes more or less closely. we have seen that the ornithorhynchus graduates towards reptiles; and prof. huxley has discovered, and is confirmed by mr. cope and others, that the dinosaurians are in many important characters intermediate between certain reptiles and certain birds--the birds referred to being the ostrich-tribe (itself evidently a widely-diffused remnant of a larger group) and the archeopteryx, that strange secondary bird, with a long lizard-like tail. again, according to prof. owen (22. 'palaeontology' 1860, p. 199.), the ichthyosaurians--great sea-lizards furnished with paddles--present many affinities with fishes, or rather, according to huxley, with amphibians; a class which, including in its highest division frogs and toads, is plainly allied to the ganoid fishes. these latter fishes swarmed during the earlier geological periods, and were constructed on what is called a generalised type, that is, they presented diversified affinities with other groups of organisms. the lepidosiren is also so closely allied to amphibians and fishes, that naturalists long disputed in which of these two classes to rank it; it, and also some few ganoid fishes, have been preserved from utter extinction by inhabiting rivers, which are harbours of refuge, and are related to the great waters of the ocean in the same way that islands are to continents. lastly, one single member of the immense and diversified class of fishes, namely, the lancelet or amphioxus, is so different from all other fishes, that haeckel maintains that it ought to form a distinct class in the vertebrate kingdom. this fish is remarkable for its negative characters; it can hardly be said to possess a brain, vertebral column, or heart, etc.; so that it was classed by the older naturalists amongst the worms. many years ago prof. goodsir perceived that the lancelet presented some affinities with the ascidians, which are invertebrate, hermaphrodite, marine creatures permanently attached to a support. they hardly appear like animals, and consist of a simple, tough, leathery sack, with two small projecting orifices. they belong to the mulluscoida of huxley--a lower division of the great kingdom of the mollusca; but they have recently been placed by some naturalists amongst the vermes or worms. their larvae somewhat resemble tadpoles in shape (23. at the falkland islands i had the satisfaction of seeing, in april, 1833, and therefore some years before any other naturalist, the locomotive larvae of a compound ascidian, closely allied to synoicum, but apparently generically distinct from it. the tail was about five times as long as the oblong head, and terminated in a very fine filament. it was, as sketched by me under a simple microscope, plainly divided by transverse opaque partitions, which i presume represent the great cells figured by kovalevsky. at an early stage of development the tail was closely coiled round the head of the larva.), and have the power of swimming freely about. mr. kovalevsky (24. 'memoires de l'acad. des sciences de st. petersbourg,' tom. x. no. 15, 1866.) has lately observed that the larvae of ascidians are related to the vertebrata, in their manner of development, in the relative position of the nervous system, and in possessing a structure closely like the chorda dorsalis of vertebrate animals; and in this he has been since confirmed by prof. kupffer. m. kovalevsky writes to me from naples, that he has now carried these observations yet further, and should his results be well established, the whole will form a discovery of the very greatest value. thus, if we may rely on embryology, ever the safest guide in classification, it seems that we have at last gained a clue to the source whence the vertebrata were derived. (25. but i am bound to add that some competent judges dispute this conclusion; for instance, m. giard, in a series of papers in the 'archives de zoologie experimentale,' for 1872. nevertheless, this naturalist remarks, p. 281, "l'organisation de la larve ascidienne en dehors de toute hypothèse et de toute théorie, nous montre comment la nature peut produire la disposition fondamentale du type vertébré (l'existence d'une corde dorsale) chez un invertébré par la seule condition vitale de l'adaptation, et cette simple possibilité du passage supprime l'abîme entre les deux sous-règnes, encore bien qu'en ignore par où le passage s'est fait en realité.") we should then be justified in believing that at an extremely remote period a group of animals existed, resembling in many respects the larvae of our present ascidians, which diverged into two great branches--the one retrograding in development and producing the present class of ascidians, the other rising to the crown and summit of the animal kingdom by giving birth to the vertebrata. we have thus far endeavoured rudely to trace the genealogy of the vertebrata by the aid of their mutual affinities. we will now look to man as he exists; and we shall, i think, be able partially to restore the structure of our early progenitors, during successive periods, but not in due order of time. this can be effected by means of the rudiments which man still retains, by the characters which occasionally make their appearance in him through reversion, and by the aid of the principles of morphology and embryology. the various facts, to which i shall here allude, have been given in the previous chapters. the early progenitors of man must have been once covered with hair, both sexes having beards; their ears were probably pointed, and capable of movement; and their bodies were provided with a tail, having the proper muscles. their limbs and bodies were also acted on by many muscles which now only occasionally reappear, but are normally present in the quadrumana. at this or some earlier period, the great artery and nerve of the humerus ran through a supra-condyloid foramen. the intestine gave forth a much larger diverticulum or caecum than that now existing. the foot was then prehensile, judging from the condition of the great toe in the foetus; and our progenitors, no doubt, were arboreal in their habits, and frequented some warm, forest-clad land. the males had great canine teeth, which served them as formidable weapons. at a much earlier period the uterus was double; the excreta were voided through a cloaca; and the eye was protected by a third eyelid or nictitating membrane. at a still earlier period the progenitors of man must have been aquatic in their habits; for morphology plainly tells us that our lungs consist of a modified swim-bladder, which once served as a float. the clefts on the neck in the embryo of man shew where the branchiae once existed. in the lunar or weekly recurrent periods of some of our functions we apparently still retain traces of our primordial birthplace, a shore washed by the tides. at about this same early period the true kidneys were replaced by the corpora wolffiana. the heart existed as a simple pulsating vessel; and the chorda dorsalis took the place of a vertebral column. these early ancestors of man, thus seen in the dim recesses of time, must have been as simply, or even still more simply organised than the lancelet or amphioxus. there is one other point deserving a fuller notice. it has long been known that in the vertebrate kingdom one sex bears rudiments of various accessory parts, appertaining to the reproductive system, which properly belong to the opposite sex; and it has now been ascertained that at a very early embryonic period both sexes possess true male and female glands. hence some remote progenitor of the whole vertebrate kingdom appears to have been hermaphrodite or androgynous. (26. this is the conclusion of prof. gegenbaur, one of the highest authorities in comparative anatomy: see 'grundzüge der vergleich. anat.' 1870, s. 876. the result has been arrived at chiefly from the study of the amphibia; but it appears from the researches of waldeyer (as quoted in 'journal of anat. and phys.' 1869, p. 161), that the sexual organs of even "the higher vertebrata are, in their early condition, hermaphrodite." similar views have long been held by some authors, though until recently without a firm basis.) but here we encounter a singular difficulty. in the mammalian class the males possess rudiments of a uterus with the adjacent passage, in their vesiculae prostaticae; they bear also rudiments of mammae, and some male marsupials have traces of a marsupial sack. (27. the male thylacinus offers the best instance. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 771.) other analogous facts could be added. are we, then, to suppose that some extremely ancient mammal continued androgynous, after it had acquired the chief distinctions of its class, and therefore after it had diverged from the lower classes of the vertebrate kingdom? this seems very improbable, for we have to look to fishes, the lowest of all the classes, to find any still existent androgynous forms. (28. hermaphroditism has been observed in several species of serranus, as well as in some other fishes, where it is either normal and symmetrical, or abnormal and unilateral. dr. zouteveen has given me references on this subject, more especially to a paper by prof. halbertsma, in the 'transact. of the dutch acad. of sciences,' vol. xvi. dr. gunther doubts the fact, but it has now been recorded by too many good observers to be any longer disputed. dr. m. lessona writes to me, that he has verified the observations made by cavolini on serranus. prof. ercolani has recently shewn ('accad. delle scienze,' bologna, dec. 28, 1871) that eels are androgynous.) that various accessory parts, proper to each sex, are found in a rudimentary condition in the opposite sex, may be explained by such organs having been gradually acquired by the one sex, and then transmitted in a more or less imperfect state to the other. when we treat of sexual selection, we shall meet with innumerable instances of this form of transmission,--as in the case of the spurs, plumes, and brilliant colours, acquired for battle or ornament by male birds, and inherited by the females in an imperfect or rudimentary condition. the possession by male mammals of functionally imperfect mammary organs is, in some respects, especially curious. the monotremata have the proper milk-secreting glands with orifices, but no nipples; and as these animals stand at the very base of the mammalian series, it is probable that the progenitors of the class also had milk-secreting glands, but no nipples. this conclusion is supported by what is known of their manner of development; for professor turner informs me, on the authority of kolliker and langer, that in the embryo the mammary glands can be distinctly traced before the nipples are in the least visible; and the development of successive parts in the individual generally represents and accords with the development of successive beings in the same line of descent. the marsupials differ from the monotremata by possessing nipples; so that probably these organs were first acquired by the marsupials, after they had diverged from, and risen above, the monotremata, and were then transmitted to the placental mammals. (29. prof. gegenbaur has shewn ('jenäische zeitschrift,' bd. vii. p. 212) that two distinct types of nipples prevail throughout the several mammalian orders, but that it is quite intelligible how both could have been derived from the nipples of the marsupials, and the latter from those of the monotremata. see, also, a memoir by dr. max huss, on the mammary glands, ibid. b. viii. p. 176.) no one will suppose that the marsupials still remained androgynous, after they had approximately acquired their present structure. how then are we to account for male mammals possessing mammae? it is possible that they were first developed in the females and then transferred to the males, but from what follows this is hardly probable. it may be suggested, as another view, that long after the progenitors of the whole mammalian class had ceased to be androgynous, both sexes yielded milk, and thus nourished their young; and in the case of the marsupials, that both sexes carried their young in marsupial sacks. this will not appear altogether improbable, if we reflect that the males of existing syngnathous fishes receive the eggs of the females in their abdominal pouches, hatch them, and afterwards, as some believe, nourish the young (30. mr. lockwood believes (as quoted in 'quart. journal of science,' april 1868, p. 269), from what he has observed of the development of hippocampus, that the walls of the abdominal pouch of the male in some way afford nourishment. on male fishes hatching the ova in their mouths, see a very interesting paper by prof. wyman, in 'proc. boston soc. of nat. hist.' sept. 15, 1857; also prof. turner, in 'journal of anatomy and physiology,' nov. 1, 1866, p. 78. dr. gunther has likewise described similar cases.);-- that certain other male fishes hatch the eggs within their mouths or branchial cavities;--that certain male toads take the chaplets of eggs from the females, and wind them round their own thighs, keeping them there until the tadpoles are born;--that certain male birds undertake the whole duty of incubation, and that male pigeons, as well as the females, feed their nestlings with a secretion from their crops. but the above suggestion first occurred to me from mammary glands of male mammals being so much more perfectly developed than the rudiments of the other accessory reproductive parts, which are found in the one sex though proper to the other. the mammary glands and nipples, as they exist in male mammals, can indeed hardly be called rudimentary; they are merely not fully developed, and not functionally active. they are sympathetically affected under the influence of certain diseases, like the same organs in the female. they often secrete a few drops of milk at birth and at puberty: this latter fact occurred in the curious case, before referred to, where a young man possessed two pairs of mammae. in man and some other male mammals these organs have been known occasionally to become so well developed during maturity as to yield a fair supply of milk. now if we suppose that during a former prolonged period male mammals aided the females in nursing their offspring (31. mlle. c. royer has suggested a similar view in her 'origine de l'homme,' etc., 1870.), and that afterwards from some cause (as from the production of a smaller number of young) the males ceased to give this aid, disuse of the organs during maturity would lead to their becoming inactive; and from two well-known principles of inheritance, this state of inactivity would probably be transmitted to the males at the corresponding age of maturity. but at an earlier age these organs would be left unaffected, so that they would be almost equally well developed in the young of both sexes. conclusion. von baer has defined advancement or progress in the organic scale better than any one else, as resting on the amount of differentiation and specialisation of the several parts of a being,--when arrived at maturity, as i should be inclined to add. now as organisms have become slowly adapted to diversified lines of life by means of natural selection, their parts will have become more and more differentiated and specialised for various functions from the advantage gained by the division of physiological labour. the same part appears often to have been modified first for one purpose, and then long afterwards for some other and quite distinct purpose; and thus all the parts are rendered more and more complex. but each organism still retains the general type of structure of the progenitor from which it was aboriginally derived. in accordance with this view it seems, if we turn to geological evidence, that organisation on the whole has advanced throughout the world by slow and interrupted steps. in the great kingdom of the vertebrata it has culminated in man. it must not, however, be supposed that groups of organic beings are always supplanted, and disappear as soon as they have given birth to other and more perfect groups. the latter, though victorious over their predecessors, may not have become better adapted for all places in the economy of nature. some old forms appear to have survived from inhabiting protected sites, where they have not been exposed to very severe competition; and these often aid us in constructing our genealogies, by giving us a fair idea of former and lost populations. but we must not fall into the error of looking at the existing members of any lowly-organised group as perfect representatives of their ancient predecessors. the most ancient progenitors in the kingdom of the vertebrata, at which we are able to obtain an obscure glance, apparently consisted of a group of marine animals (32. the inhabitants of the seashore must be greatly affected by the tides; animals living either about the mean high-water mark, or about the mean low-water mark, pass through a complete cycle of tidal changes in a fortnight. consequently, their food supply will undergo marked changes week by week. the vital functions of such animals, living under these conditions for many generations, can hardly fail to run their course in regular weekly periods. now it is a mysterious fact that in the higher and now terrestrial vertebrata, as well as in other classes, many normal and abnormal processes have one or more whole weeks as their periods; this would be rendered intelligible if the vertebrata are descended from an animal allied to the existing tidal ascidians. many instances of such periodic processes might be given, as the gestation of mammals, the duration of fevers, etc. the hatching of eggs affords also a good example, for, according to mr. bartlett ('land and water,' jan. 7, 1871), the eggs of the pigeon are hatched in two weeks; those of the fowl in three; those of the duck in four; those of the goose in five; and those of the ostrich in seven weeks. as far as we can judge, a recurrent period, if approximately of the right duration for any process or function, would not, when once gained, be liable to change; consequently it might be thus transmitted through almost any number of generations. but if the function changed, the period would have to change, and would be apt to change almost abruptly by a whole week. this conclusion, if sound, is highly remarkable; for the period of gestation in each mammal, and the hatching of each bird's eggs, and many other vital processes, thus betray to us the primordial birthplace of these animals.), resembling the larvae of existing ascidians. these animals probably gave rise to a group of fishes, as lowly organised as the lancelet; and from these the ganoids, and other fishes like the lepidosiren, must have been developed. from such fish a very small advance would carry us on to the amphibians. we have seen that birds and reptiles were once intimately connected together; and the monotremata now connect mammals with reptiles in a slight degree. but no one can at present say by what line of descent the three higher and related classes, namely, mammals, birds, and reptiles, were derived from the two lower vertebrate classes, namely, amphibians and fishes. in the class of mammals the steps are not difficult to conceive which led from the ancient monotremata to the ancient marsupials; and from these to the early progenitors of the placental mammals. we may thus ascend to the lemuridae; and the interval is not very wide from these to the simiadae. the simiadae then branched off into two great stems, the new world and old world monkeys; and from the latter, at a remote period, man, the wonder and glory of the universe, proceeded. thus we have given to man a pedigree of prodigious length, but not, it may be said, of noble quality. the world, it has often been remarked, appears as if it had long been preparing for the advent of man: and this, in one sense is strictly true, for he owes his birth to a long line of progenitors. if any single link in this chain had never existed, man would not have been exactly what he now is. unless we wilfully close our eyes, we may, with our present knowledge, approximately recognise our parentage; nor need we feel ashamed of it. the most humble organism is something much higher than the inorganic dust under our feet; and no one with an unbiassed mind can study any living creature, however humble, without being struck with enthusiasm at its marvellous structure and properties. chapter vii. on the races of man. the nature and value of specific characters--application to the races of man--arguments in favour of, and opposed to, ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species--sub-species--monogenists and polygenists-- convergence of character--numerous points of resemblance in body and mind between the most distinct races of man--the state of man when he first spread over the earth--each race not descended from a single pair--the extinction of races--the formation of races--the effects of crossing-- slight influence of the direct action of the conditions of life--slight or no influence of natural selection--sexual selection. it is not my intention here to describe the several so-called races of men; but i am about to enquire what is the value of the differences between them under a classificatory point of view, and how they have originated. in determining whether two or more allied forms ought to be ranked as species or varieties, naturalists are practically guided by the following considerations; namely, the amount of difference between them, and whether such differences relate to few or many points of structure, and whether they are of physiological importance; but more especially whether they are constant. constancy of character is what is chiefly valued and sought for by naturalists. whenever it can be shewn, or rendered probable, that the forms in question have remained distinct for a long period, this becomes an argument of much weight in favour of treating them as species. even a slight degree of sterility between any two forms when first crossed, or in their offspring, is generally considered as a decisive test of their specific distinctness; and their continued persistence without blending within the same area, is usually accepted as sufficient evidence, either of some degree of mutual sterility, or in the case of animals of some mutual repugnance to pairing. independently of fusion from intercrossing, the complete absence, in a well-investigated region, of varieties linking together any two closely- allied forms, is probably the most important of all the criterions of their specific distinctness; and this is a somewhat different consideration from mere constancy of character, for two forms may be highly variable and yet not yield intermediate varieties. geographical distribution is often brought into play unconsciously and sometimes consciously; so that forms living in two widely separated areas, in which most of the other inhabitants are specifically distinct, are themselves usually looked at as distinct; but in truth this affords no aid in distinguishing geographical races from so-called good or true species. now let us apply these generally-admitted principles to the races of man, viewing him in the same spirit as a naturalist would any other animal. in regard to the amount of difference between the races, we must make some allowance for our nice powers of discrimination gained by the long habit of observing ourselves. in india, as elphinstone remarks, although a newly- arrived european cannot at first distinguish the various native races, yet they soon appear to him extremely dissimilar (1. 'history of india,' 1841, vol. i. p. 323. father ripa makes exactly the same remark with respect to the chinese.); and the hindoo cannot at first perceive any difference between the several european nations. even the most distinct races of man are much more like each other in form than would at first be supposed; certain negro tribes must be excepted, whilst others, as dr. rohlfs writes to me, and as i have myself seen, have caucasian features. this general similarity is well shewn by the french photographs in the collection anthropologique du museum de paris of the men belonging to various races, the greater number of which might pass for europeans, as many persons to whom i have shewn them have remarked. nevertheless, these men, if seen alive, would undoubtedly appear very distinct, so that we are clearly much influenced in our judgment by the mere colour of the skin and hair, by slight differences in the features, and by expression. there is, however, no doubt that the various races, when carefully compared and measured, differ much from each other,--as in the texture of the hair, the relative proportions of all parts of the body (2. a vast number of measurements of whites, blacks, and indians, are given in the 'investigations in the military and anthropolog. statistics of american soldiers,' by b.a. gould, 1869, pp. 298-358; 'on the capacity of the lungs,' p. 471. see also the numerous and valuable tables, by dr. weisbach, from the observations of dr. scherzer and dr. schwarz, in the 'reise der novara: anthropolog. theil,' 1867.), the capacity of the lungs, the form and capacity of the skull, and even in the convolutions of the brain. (3. see, for instance, mr. marshall's account of the brain of a bushwoman, in 'philosophical transactions,' 1864, p. 519.) but it would be an endless task to specify the numerous points of difference. the races differ also in constitution, in acclimatisation and in liability to certain diseases. their mental characteristics are likewise very distinct; chiefly as it would appear in their emotional, but partly in their intellectual faculties. every one who has had the opportunity of comparison, must have been struck with the contrast between the taciturn, even morose, aborigines of s. america and the light-hearted, talkative negroes. there is a nearly similar contrast between the malays and the papuans (4. wallace, 'the malay archipelago,' vol. ii. 1869, p. 178.), who live under the same physical conditions, and are separated from each other only by a narrow space of sea. we will first consider the arguments which may be advanced in favour of classing the races of man as distinct species, and then the arguments on the other side. if a naturalist, who had never before seen a negro, hottentot, australian, or mongolian, were to compare them, he would at once perceive that they differed in a multitude of characters, some of slight and some of considerable importance. on enquiry he would find that they were adapted to live under widely different climates, and that they differed somewhat in bodily constitution and mental disposition. if he were then told that hundreds of similar specimens could be brought from the same countries, he would assuredly declare that they were as good species as many to which he had been in the habit of affixing specific names. this conclusion would be greatly strengthened as soon as he had ascertained that these forms had all retained the same character for many centuries; and that negroes, apparently identical with existing negroes, had lived at least 4000 years ago. (5. with respect to the figures in the famous egyptian caves of abou-simbel, m. pouchet says ('the plurality of the human races,' eng. translat., 1864, p. 50), that he was far from finding recognisable representations of the dozen or more nations which some authors believe that they can recognise. even some of the most strongly- marked races cannot be identified with that degree of unanimity which might have been expected from what has been written on the subject. thus messrs. nott and gliddon ('types of mankind,' p. 148), state that rameses ii., or the great, has features superbly european; whereas knox, another firm believer in the specific distinctness of the races of man ('races of man,' 1850, p. 201), speaking of young memnon (the same as rameses ii., as i am informed by mr. birch), insists in the strongest manner that he is identical in character with the jews of antwerp. again, when i looked at the statue of amunoph iii., i agreed with two officers of the establishment, both competent judges, that he had a strongly-marked negro type of features; but messrs. nott and gliddon (ibid. p. 146, fig. 53), describe him as a hybrid, but not of "negro intermixture.") he would also hear, on the authority of an excellent observer, dr. lund (6. as quoted by nott and gliddon, 'types of mankind,' 1854, p. 439. they give also corroborative evidence; but c. vogt thinks that the subject requires further investigation.), that the human skulls found in the caves of brazil, entombed with many extinct mammals, belonged to the same type as that now prevailing throughout the american continent. our naturalist would then perhaps turn to geographical distribution, and he would probably declare that those forms must be distinct species, which differ not only in appearance, but are fitted for hot, as well as damp or dry countries, and for the arctic regions. he might appeal to the fact that no species in the group next to man--namely, the quadrumana, can resist a low temperature, or any considerable change of climate; and that the species which come nearest to man have never been reared to maturity, even under the temperate climate of europe. he would be deeply impressed with the fact, first noticed by agassiz (7. 'diversity of origin of the human races,' in the 'christian examiner,' july 1850.), that the different races of man are distributed over the world in the same zoological provinces, as those inhabited by undoubtedly distinct species and genera of mammals. this is manifestly the case with the australian, mongolian, and negro races of man; in a less well-marked manner with the hottentots; but plainly with the papuans and malays, who are separated, as mr. wallace has shewn, by nearly the same line which divides the great malayan and australian zoological provinces. the aborigines of america range throughout the continent; and this at first appears opposed to the above rule, for most of the productions of the southern and northern halves differ widely: yet some few living forms, as the opossum, range from the one into the other, as did formerly some of the gigantic edentata. the esquimaux, like other arctic animals, extend round the whole polar regions. it should be observed that the amount of difference between the mammals of the several zoological provinces does not correspond with the degree of separation between the latter; so that it can hardly be considered as an anomaly that the negro differs more, and the american much less from the other races of man, than do the mammals of the african and american continents from the mammals of the other provinces. man, it may be added, does not appear to have aboriginally inhabited any oceanic island; and in this respect, he resembles the other members of his class. in determining whether the supposed varieties of the same kind of domestic animal should be ranked as such, or as specifically distinct, that is, whether any of them are descended from distinct wild species, every naturalist would lay much stress on the fact of their external parasites being specifically distinct. all the more stress would be laid on this fact, as it would be an exceptional one; for i am informed by mr. denny that the most different kinds of dogs, fowls, and pigeons, in england, are infested by the same species of pediculi or lice. now mr. a. murray has carefully examined the pediculi collected in different countries from the different races of man (8. 'transactions of the royal society of edinburgh,' vol. xxii, 1861, p. 567.); and he finds that they differ, not only in colour, but in the structure of their claws and limbs. in every case in which many specimens were obtained the differences were constant. the surgeon of a whaling ship in the pacific assured me that when the pediculi, with which some sandwich islanders on board swarmed, strayed on to the bodies of the english sailors, they died in the course of three or four days. these pediculi were darker coloured, and appeared different from those proper to the natives of chiloe in south america, of which he gave me specimens. these, again, appeared larger and much softer than european lice. mr. murray procured four kinds from africa, namely, from the negroes of the eastern and western coasts, from the hottentots and kaffirs; two kinds from the natives of australia; two from north and two from south america. in these latter cases it may be presumed that the pediculi came from natives inhabiting different districts. with insects slight structural differences, if constant, are generally esteemed of specific value: and the fact of the races of man being infested by parasites, which appear to be specifically distinct, might fairly be urged as an argument that the races themselves ought to be classed as distinct species. our supposed naturalist having proceeded thus far in his investigation, would next enquire whether the races of men, when crossed, were in any degree sterile. he might consult the work (9. 'on the phenomena of hybridity in the genus homo,' eng. translat., 1864.) of professor broca, a cautious and philosophical observer, and in this he would find good evidence that some races were quite fertile together, but evidence of an opposite nature in regard to other races. thus it has been asserted that the native women of australia and tasmania rarely produce children to european men; the evidence, however, on this head has now been shewn to be almost valueless. the half-castes are killed by the pure blacks: and an account has lately been published of eleven half-caste youths murdered and burnt at the same time, whose remains were found by the police. (10. see the interesting letter by mr. t.a. murray, in the 'anthropological review,' april 1868, p. liii. in this letter count strzelecki's statement that australian women who have borne children to a white man, are afterwards sterile with their own race, is disproved. m. a. de quatrefages has also collected (revue des cours scientifiques, march, 1869, p. 239), much evidence that australians and europeans are not sterile when crossed.) again, it has often been said that when mulattoes intermarry, they produce few children; on the other hand, dr. bachman, of charleston (11. 'an examination of prof. agassiz's sketch of the nat. provinces of the animal world,' charleston, 1855, p. 44.), positively asserts that he has known mulatto families which have intermarried for several generations, and have continued on an average as fertile as either pure whites or pure blacks. enquiries formerly made by sir c. lyell on this subject led him, as he informs me, to the same conclusion. (12. dr. rohlfs writes to me that he found the mixed races in the great sahara, derived from arabs, berbers, and negroes of three tribes, extraordinarily fertile. on the other hand, mr. winwood reade informs me that the negroes on the gold coast, though admiring white men and mulattoes, have a maxim that mulattoes should not intermarry, as the children are few and sickly. this belief, as mr. reade remarks, deserves attention, as white men have visited and resided on the gold coast for four hundred years, so that the natives have had ample time to gain knowledge through experience.) in the united states the census for the year 1854 included, according to dr. bachman, 405,751 mulattoes; and this number, considering all the circumstances of the case, seems small; but it may partly be accounted for by the degraded and anomalous position of the class, and by the profligacy of the women. a certain amount of absorption of mulattoes into negroes must always be in progress; and this would lead to an apparent diminution of the former. the inferior vitality of mulattoes is spoken of in a trustworthy work (13. 'military and anthropological statistics of american soldiers,' by b.a. gould, 1869, p. 319.) as a well-known phenomenon; and this, although a different consideration from their lessened fertility, may perhaps be advanced as a proof of the specific distinctness of the parent races. no doubt both animal and vegetable hybrids, when produced from extremely distinct species, are liable to premature death; but the parents of mulattoes cannot be put under the category of extremely distinct species. the common mule, so notorious for long life and vigour, and yet so sterile, shews how little necessary connection there is in hybrids between lessened fertility and vitality; other analogous cases could be cited. even if it should hereafter be proved that all the races of men were perfectly fertile together, he who was inclined from other reasons to rank them as distinct species, might with justice argue that fertility and sterility are not safe criterions of specific distinctness. we know that these qualities are easily affected by changed conditions of life, or by close inter-breeding, and that they are governed by highly complex laws, for instance, that of the unequal fertility of converse crosses between the same two species. with forms which must be ranked as undoubted species, a perfect series exists from those which are absolutely sterile when crossed, to those which are almost or completely fertile. the degrees of sterility do not coincide strictly with the degrees of difference between the parents in external structure or habits of life. man in many respects may be compared with those animals which have long been domesticated, and a large body of evidence can be advanced in favour of the pallasian doctrine (14. the 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. p. 109. i may here remind the reader that the sterility of species when crossed is not a specially-acquired quality, but, like the incapacity of certain trees to be grafted together, is incidental on other acquired differences. the nature of these differences is unknown, but they relate more especially to the reproductive system, and much less so to external structure or to ordinary differences in constitution. one important element in the sterility of crossed species apparently lies in one or both having been long habituated to fixed conditions; for we know that changed conditions have a special influence on the reproductive system, and we have good reason to believe (as before remarked) that the fluctuating conditions of domestication tend to eliminate that sterility which is so general with species, in a natural state, when crossed. it has elsewhere been shewn by me (ibid. vol. ii. p. 185, and 'origin of species,' 5th edit. p. 317), that the sterility of crossed species has not been acquired through natural selection: we can see that when two forms have already been rendered very sterile, it is scarcely possible that their sterility should be augmented by the preservation or survival of the more and more sterile individuals; for, as the sterility increases, fewer and fewer offspring will be produced from which to breed, and at last only single individuals will be produced at the rarest intervals. but there is even a higher grade of sterility than this. both gartner and kolreuter have proved that in genera of plants, including many species, a series can be formed from species which, when crossed, yield fewer and fewer seeds, to species which never produce a single seed, but yet are affected by the pollen of the other species, as shewn by the swelling of the germen. it is here manifestly impossible to select the more sterile individuals, which have already ceased to yield seeds; so that the acme of sterility, when the germen alone is affected, cannot have been gained through selection. this acme, and no doubt the other grades of sterility, are the incidental results of certain unknown differences in the constitution of the reproductive system of the species which are crossed.), that domestication tends to eliminate the sterility which is so general a result of the crossing of species in a state of nature. from these several considerations, it may be justly urged that the perfect fertility of the intercrossed races of man, if established, would not absolutely preclude us from ranking them as distinct species. independently of fertility, the characters presented by the offspring from a cross have been thought to indicate whether or not the parent-forms ought to be ranked as species or varieties; but after carefully studying the evidence, i have come to the conclusion that no general rules of this kind can be trusted. the ordinary result of a cross is the production of a blended or intermediate form; but in certain cases some of the offspring take closely after one parent-form, and some after the other. this is especially apt to occur when the parents differ in characters which first appeared as sudden variations or monstrosities. (15. 'the variation of animals,' etc., vol. ii. p. 92.) i refer to this point, because dr. rohlfs informs me that he has frequently seen in africa the offspring of negroes crossed with members of other races, either completely black or completely white, or rarely piebald. on the other hand, it is notorious that in america mulattoes commonly present an intermediate appearance. we have now seen that a naturalist might feel himself fully justified in ranking the races of man as distinct species; for he has found that they are distinguished by many differences in structure and constitution, some being of importance. these differences have, also, remained nearly constant for very long periods of time. our naturalist will have been in some degree influenced by the enormous range of man, which is a great anomaly in the class of mammals, if mankind be viewed as a single species. he will have been struck with the distribution of the several so-called races, which accords with that of other undoubtedly distinct species of mammals. finally, he might urge that the mutual fertility of all the races has not as yet been fully proved, and even if proved would not be an absolute proof of their specific identity. on the other side of the question, if our supposed naturalist were to enquire whether the forms of man keep distinct like ordinary species, when mingled together in large numbers in the same country, he would immediately discover that this was by no means the case. in brazil he would behold an immense mongrel population of negroes and portuguese; in chiloe, and other parts of south america, he would behold the whole population consisting of indians and spaniards blended in various degrees. (16. m. de quatrefages has given ('anthropological review,' jan. 1869, p. 22), an interesting account of the success and energy of the paulistas in brazil, who are a much crossed race of portuguese and indians, with a mixture of the blood of other races.) in many parts of the same continent he would meet with the most complex crosses between negroes, indians, and europeans; and judging from the vegetable kingdom, such triple crosses afford the severest test of the mutual fertility of the parent forms. in one island of the pacific he would find a small population of mingled polynesian and english blood; and in the fiji archipelago a population of polynesian and negritos crossed in all degrees. many analogous cases could be added; for instance, in africa. hence the races of man are not sufficiently distinct to inhabit the same country without fusion; and the absence of fusion affords the usual and best test of specific distinctness. our naturalist would likewise be much disturbed as soon as he perceived that the distinctive characters of all the races were highly variable. this fact strikes every one on first beholding the negro slaves in brazil, who have been imported from all parts of africa. the same remark holds good with the polynesians, and with many other races. it may be doubted whether any character can be named which is distinctive of a race and is constant. savages, even within the limits of the same tribe, are not nearly so uniform in character, as has been often asserted. hottentot women offer certain peculiarities, more strongly marked than those occurring in any other race, but these are known not to be of constant occurrence. in the several american tribes, colour and hairiness differ considerably; as does colour to a certain degree, and the shape of the features greatly, in the negroes of africa. the shape of the skull varies much in some races (17. for instance, with the aborigines of america and australia, prof. huxley says ('transact. internat. congress of prehist. arch.' 1868, p. 105), that the skulls of many south germans and swiss are "as short and as broad as those of the tartars," etc.); and so it is with every other character. now all naturalists have learnt by dearly bought experience, how rash it is to attempt to define species by the aid of inconstant characters. but the most weighty of all the arguments against treating the races of man as distinct species, is that they graduate into each other, independently in many cases, as far as we can judge, of their having intercrossed. man has been studied more carefully than any other animal, and yet there is the greatest possible diversity amongst capable judges whether he should be classed as a single species or race, or as two (virey), as three (jacquinot), as four (kant), five (blumenbach), six (buffon), seven (hunter), eight (agassiz), eleven (pickering), fifteen (bory st. vincent), sixteen (desmoulins), twenty-two (morton), sixty (crawfurd), or as sixty- three, according to burke. (18. see a good discussion on this subject in waitz, 'introduction to anthropology,' eng. translat., 1863, pp. 198-208, 227. i have taken some of the above statements from h. tuttle's 'origin and antiquity of physical man,' boston, 1866, p. 35.) this diversity of judgment does not prove that the races ought not to be ranked as species, but it shews that they graduate into each other, and that it is hardly possible to discover clear distinctive characters between them. every naturalist who has had the misfortune to undertake the description of a group of highly varying organisms, has encountered cases (i speak after experience) precisely like that of man; and if of a cautious disposition, he will end by uniting all the forms which graduate into each other, under a single species; for he will say to himself that he has no right to give names to objects which he cannot define. cases of this kind occur in the order which includes man, namely in certain genera of monkeys; whilst in other genera, as in cercopithecus, most of the species can be determined with certainty. in the american genus cebus, the various forms are ranked by some naturalists as species, by others as mere geographical races. now if numerous specimens of cebus were collected from all parts of south america, and those forms which at present appear to be specifically distinct, were found to graduate into each other by close steps, they would usually be ranked as mere varieties or races; and this course has been followed by most naturalists with respect to the races of man. nevertheless, it must be confessed that there are forms, at least in the vegetable kingdom (19. prof. nageli has carefully described several striking cases in his 'botanische mittheilungen,' b. ii. 1866, ss. 294-369. prof. asa gray has made analogous remarks on some intermediate forms in the compositae of n. america.), which we cannot avoid naming as species, but which are connected together by numberless gradations, independently of intercrossing. some naturalists have lately employed the term "sub-species" to designate forms which possess many of the characteristics of true species, but which hardly deserve so high a rank. now if we reflect on the weighty arguments above given, for raising the races of man to the dignity of species, and the insuperable difficulties on the other side in defining them, it seems that the term "sub-species" might here be used with propriety. but from long habit the term "race" will perhaps always be employed. the choice of terms is only so far important in that it is desirable to use, as far as possible, the same terms for the same degrees of difference. unfortunately this can rarely be done: for the larger genera generally include closely- allied forms, which can be distinguished only with much difficulty, whilst the smaller genera within the same family include forms that are perfectly distinct; yet all must be ranked equally as species. so again, species within the same large genus by no means resemble each other to the same degree: on the contrary, some of them can generally be arranged in little groups round other species, like satellites round planets. (20. 'origin of species,' 5th edit. p. 68.) the question whether mankind consists of one or several species has of late years been much discussed by anthropologists, who are divided into the two schools of monogenists and polygenists. those who do not admit the principle of evolution, must look at species as separate creations, or in some manner as distinct entities; and they must decide what forms of man they will consider as species by the analogy of the method commonly pursued in ranking other organic beings as species. but it is a hopeless endeavour to decide this point, until some definition of the term "species" is generally accepted; and the definition must not include an indeterminate element such as an act of creation. we might as well attempt without any definition to decide whether a certain number of houses should be called a village, town, or city. we have a practical illustration of the difficulty in the never-ending doubts whether many closely-allied mammals, birds, insects, and plants, which represent each other respectively in north america and europe, should be ranked as species or geographical races; and the like holds true of the productions of many islands situated at some little distance from the nearest continent. those naturalists, on the other hand, who admit the principle of evolution, and this is now admitted by the majority of rising men, will feel no doubt that all the races of man are descended from a single primitive stock; whether or not they may think fit to designate the races as distinct species, for the sake of expressing their amount of difference. (21. see prof. huxley to this effect in the 'fortnightly review,' 1865, p. 275.) with our domestic animals the question whether the various races have arisen from one or more species is somewhat different. although it may be admitted that all the races, as well as all the natural species within the same genus, have sprung from the same primitive stock, yet it is a fit subject for discussion, whether all the domestic races of the dog, for instance, have acquired their present amount of difference since some one species was first domesticated by man; or whether they owe some of their characters to inheritance from distinct species, which had already been differentiated in a state of nature. with man no such question can arise, for he cannot be said to have been domesticated at any particular period. during an early stage in the divergence of the races of man from a common stock, the differences between the races and their number must have been small; consequently as far as their distinguishing characters are concerned, they then had less claim to rank as distinct species than the existing so-called races. nevertheless, so arbitrary is the term of species, that such early races would perhaps have been ranked by some naturalists as distinct species, if their differences, although extremely slight, had been more constant than they are at present, and had not graduated into each other. it is however possible, though far from probable, that the early progenitors of man might formerly have diverged much in character, until they became more unlike each other than any now existing races; but that subsequently, as suggested by vogt (22. 'lectures on man,' eng. translat., 1864, p. 468.), they converged in character. when man selects the offspring of two distinct species for the same object, he sometimes induces a considerable amount of convergence, as far as general appearance is concerned. this is the case, as shewn by von nathusius (23. 'die rassen des schweines,' 1860, s. 46. 'vorstudien für geschichte,' etc., schweinesschädel, 1864, s. 104. with respect to cattle, see m. de quatrefages, 'unité de l'espèce humaine,' 1861, p. 119.), with the improved breeds of the pig, which are descended from two distinct species; and in a less marked manner with the improved breeds of cattle. a great anatomist, gratiolet, maintains that the anthropomorphous apes do not form a natural sub-group; but that the orang is a highly developed gibbon or semnopithecus, the chimpanzee a highly developed macacus, and the gorilla a highly developed mandrill. if this conclusion, which rests almost exclusively on brain-characters, be admitted, we should have a case of convergence at least in external characters, for the anthropomorphous apes are certainly more like each other in many points, than they are to other apes. all analogical resemblances, as of a whale to a fish, may indeed be said to be cases of convergence; but this term has never been applied to superficial and adaptive resemblances. it would, however, be extremely rash to attribute to convergence close similarity of character in many points of structure amongst the modified descendants of widely distinct beings. the form of a crystal is determined solely by the molecular forces, and it is not surprising that dissimilar substances should sometimes assume the same form; but with organic beings we should bear in mind that the form of each depends on an infinity of complex relations, namely on variations, due to causes far too intricate to be followed,--on the nature of the variations preserved, these depending on the physical conditions, and still more on the surrounding organisms which compete with each,--and lastly, on inheritance (in itself a fluctuating element) from innumerable progenitors, all of which have had their forms determined through equally complex relations. it appears incredible that the modified descendants of two organisms, if these differed from each other in a marked manner, should ever afterwards converge so closely as to lead to a near approach to identity throughout their whole organisation. in the case of the convergent races of pigs above referred to, evidence of their descent from two primitive stocks is, according to von nathusius, still plainly retained, in certain bones of their skulls. if the races of man had descended, as is supposed by some naturalists, from two or more species, which differed from each other as much, or nearly as much, as does the orang from the gorilla, it can hardly be doubted that marked differences in the structure of certain bones would still be discoverable in man as he now exists. although the existing races of man differ in many respects, as in colour, hair, shape of skull, proportions of the body, etc., yet if their whole structure be taken into consideration they are found to resemble each other closely in a multitude of points. many of these are of so unimportant or of so singular a nature, that it is extremely improbable that they should have been independently acquired by aboriginally distinct species or races. the same remark holds good with equal or greater force with respect to the numerous points of mental similarity between the most distinct races of man. the american aborigines, negroes and europeans are as different from each other in mind as any three races that can be named; yet i was incessantly struck, whilst living with the fuegians on board the "beagle," with the many little traits of character, shewing how similar their minds were to ours; and so it was with a full-blooded negro with whom i happened once to be intimate. he who will read mr. tylor's and sir j. lubbock's interesting works (24. tylor's 'early history of mankind,' 1865: with respect to gesture- language, see p. 54. lubbock's 'prehistoric times,' 2nd edit. 1869.) can hardly fail to be deeply impressed with the close similarity between the men of all races in tastes, dispositions and habits. this is shewn by the pleasure which they all take in dancing, rude music, acting, painting, tattooing, and otherwise decorating themselves; in their mutual comprehension of gesture-language, by the same expression in their features, and by the same inarticulate cries, when excited by the same emotions. this similarity, or rather identity, is striking, when contrasted with the different expressions and cries made by distinct species of monkeys. there is good evidence that the art of shooting with bows and arrows has not been handed down from any common progenitor of mankind, yet as westropp and nilsson have remarked (25. 'on analogous forms of implements,' in 'memoirs of anthropological society' by h.m. westropp. 'the primitive inhabitants of scandinavia,' eng. translat., edited by sir j. lubbock, 1868, p. 104.), the stone arrow-heads, brought from the most distant parts of the world, and manufactured at the most remote periods, are almost identical; and this fact can only be accounted for by the various races having similar inventive or mental powers. the same observation has been made by archaeologists (26. westropp 'on cromlechs,' etc., 'journal of ethnological soc.' as given in 'scientific opinion,' june 2nd, 1869, p. 3.) with respect to certain widely-prevalent ornaments, such as zig-zags, etc.; and with respect to various simple beliefs and customs, such as the burying of the dead under megalithic structures. i remember observing in south america (27. 'journal of researches: voyage of the "beagle,"' p. 46.), that there, as in so many other parts of the world, men have generally chosen the summits of lofty hills, to throw up piles of stones, either as a record of some remarkable event, or for burying their dead. now when naturalists observe a close agreement in numerous small details of habits, tastes, and dispositions between two or more domestic races, or between nearly-allied natural forms, they use this fact as an argument that they are descended from a common progenitor who was thus endowed; and consequently that all should be classed under the same species. the same argument may be applied with much force to the races of man. as it is improbable that the numerous and unimportant points of resemblance between the several races of man in bodily structure and mental faculties (i do not here refer to similar customs) should all have been independently acquired, they must have been inherited from progenitors who had these same characters. we thus gain some insight into the early state of man, before he had spread step by step over the face of the earth. the spreading of man to regions widely separated by the sea, no doubt, preceded any great amount of divergence of character in the several races; for otherwise we should sometimes meet with the same race in distinct continents; and this is never the case. sir j. lubbock, after comparing the arts now practised by savages in all parts of the world, specifies those which man could not have known, when he first wandered from his original birthplace; for if once learnt they would never have been forgotten. (28. 'prehistoric times,' 1869, p. 574.) he thus shews that "the spear, which is but a development of the knife-point, and the club, which is but a long hammer, are the only things left." he admits, however, that the art of making fire probably had been already discovered, for it is common to all the races now existing, and was known to the ancient cave-inhabitants of europe. perhaps the art of making rude canoes or rafts was likewise known; but as man existed at a remote epoch, when the land in many places stood at a very different level to what it does now, he would have been able, without the aid of canoes, to have spread widely. sir j. lubbock further remarks how improbable it is that our earliest ancestors could have "counted as high as ten, considering that so many races now in existence cannot get beyond four." nevertheless, at this early period, the intellectual and social faculties of man could hardly have been inferior in any extreme degree to those possessed at present by the lowest savages; otherwise primeval man could not have been so eminently successful in the struggle for life, as proved by his early and wide diffusion. from the fundamental differences between certain languages, some philologists have inferred that when man first became widely diffused, he was not a speaking animal; but it may be suspected that languages, far less perfect than any now spoken, aided by gestures, might have been used, and yet have left no traces on subsequent and more highly-developed tongues. without the use of some language, however imperfect, it appears doubtful whether man's intellect could have risen to the standard implied by his dominant position at an early period. whether primeval man, when he possessed but few arts, and those of the rudest kind, and when his power of language was extremely imperfect, would have deserved to be called man, must depend on the definition which we employ. in a series of forms graduating insensibly from some ape-like creature to man as he now exists, it would be impossible to fix on any definite point where the term "man" ought to be used. but this is a matter of very little importance. so again, it is almost a matter of indifference whether the so-called races of man are thus designated, or are ranked as species or sub-species; but the latter term appears the more appropriate. finally, we may conclude that when the principle of evolution is generally accepted, as it surely will be before long, the dispute between the monogenists and the polygenists will die a silent and unobserved death. one other question ought not to be passed over without notice, namely, whether, as is sometimes assumed, each sub-species or race of man has sprung from a single pair of progenitors. with our domestic animals a new race can readily be formed by carefully matching the varying offspring from a single pair, or even from a single individual possessing some new character; but most of our races have been formed, not intentionally from a selected pair, but unconsciously by the preservation of many individuals which have varied, however slightly, in some useful or desired manner. if in one country stronger and heavier horses, and in another country lighter and fleeter ones, were habitually preferred, we may feel sure that two distinct sub-breeds would be produced in the course of time, without any one pair having been separated and bred from, in either country. many races have been thus formed, and their manner of formation is closely analogous to that of natural species. we know, also, that the horses taken to the falkland islands have, during successive generations, become smaller and weaker, whilst those which have run wild on the pampas have acquired larger and coarser heads; and such changes are manifestly due, not to any one pair, but to all the individuals having been subjected to the same conditions, aided, perhaps, by the principle of reversion. the new sub- breeds in such cases are not descended from any single pair, but from many individuals which have varied in different degrees, but in the same general manner; and we may conclude that the races of man have been similarly produced, the modifications being either the direct result of exposure to different conditions, or the indirect result of some form of selection. but to this latter subject we shall presently return. on the extinction of the races of man. the partial or complete extinction of many races and sub-races of man is historically known. humboldt saw in south america a parrot which was the sole living creature that could speak a word of the language of a lost tribe. ancient monuments and stone implements found in all parts of the world, about which no tradition has been preserved by the present inhabitants, indicate much extinction. some small and broken tribes, remnants of former races, still survive in isolated and generally mountainous districts. in europe the ancient races were all, according to shaaffhausen (29. translation in 'anthropological review,' oct. 1868, p. 431.), "lower in the scale than the rudest living savages"; they must therefore have differed, to a certain extent, from any existing race. the remains described by professor broca from les eyzies, though they unfortunately appear to have belonged to a single family, indicate a race with a most singular combination of low or simious, and of high characteristics. this race is "entirely different from any other, ancient or modern, that we have heard of." (30. 'transactions, international congress of prehistoric archaeology' 1868, pp. 172-175. see also broca (tr.) in 'anthropological review,' oct. 1868, p. 410.) it differed, therefore, from the quaternary race of the caverns of belgium. man can long resist conditions which appear extremely unfavourable for his existence. (31. dr. gerland, 'ueber das aussterben der naturvölker,' 1868, s. 82.) he has long lived in the extreme regions of the north, with no wood for his canoes or implements, and with only blubber as fuel, and melted snow as drink. in the southern extremity of america the fuegians survive without the protection of clothes, or of any building worthy to be called a hovel. in south africa the aborigines wander over arid plains, where dangerous beasts abound. man can withstand the deadly influence of the terai at the foot of the himalaya, and the pestilential shores of tropical africa. extinction follows chiefly from the competition of tribe with tribe, and race with race. various checks are always in action, serving to keep down the numbers of each savage tribe,--such as periodical famines, nomadic habits and the consequent deaths of infants, prolonged suckling, wars, accidents, sickness, licentiousness, the stealing of women, infanticide, and especially lessened fertility. if any one of these checks increases in power, even slightly, the tribe thus affected tends to decrease; and when of two adjoining tribes one becomes less numerous and less powerful than the other, the contest is soon settled by war, slaughter, cannibalism, slavery, and absorption. even when a weaker tribe is not thus abruptly swept away, if it once begins to decrease, it generally goes on decreasing until it becomes extinct. (32. gerland (ibid. s. 12) gives facts in support of this statement.) when civilised nations come into contact with barbarians the struggle is short, except where a deadly climate gives its aid to the native race. of the causes which lead to the victory of civilised nations, some are plain and simple, others complex and obscure. we can see that the cultivation of the land will be fatal in many ways to savages, for they cannot, or will not, change their habits. new diseases and vices have in some cases proved highly destructive; and it appears that a new disease often causes much death, until those who are most susceptible to its destructive influence are gradually weeded out (33. see remarks to this effect in sir h. holland's 'medical notes and reflections,' 1839, p. 390.); and so it may be with the evil effects from spirituous liquors, as well as with the unconquerably strong taste for them shewn by so many savages. it further appears, mysterious as is the fact, that the first meeting of distinct and separated people generates disease. (34. i have collected ('journal of researches: voyage of the "beagle,"' p. 435) a good many cases bearing on this subject; see also gerland, ibid. s. 8. poeppig speaks of the "breath of civilisation as poisonous to savages.") mr. sproat, who in vancouver island closely attended to the subject of extinction, believed that changed habits of life, consequent on the advent of europeans, induces much ill health. he lays, also, great stress on the apparently trifling cause that the natives become "bewildered and dull by the new life around them; they lose the motives for exertion, and get no new ones in their place." (35. sproat, 'scenes and studies of savage life,' 1868, p. 284.) the grade of their civilisation seems to be a most important element in the success of competing nations. a few centuries ago europe feared the inroads of eastern barbarians; now any such fear would be ridiculous. it is a more curious fact, as mr. bagehot has remarked, that savages did not formerly waste away before the classical nations, as they now do before modern civilised nations; had they done so, the old moralists would have mused over the event; but there is no lament in any writer of that period over the perishing barbarians. (36. bagehot, 'physics and politics,' 'fortnightly review,' april 1, 1868, p. 455.) the most potent of all the causes of extinction, appears in many cases to be lessened fertility and ill-health, especially amongst the children, arising from changed conditions of life, notwithstanding that the new conditions may not be injurious in themselves. i am much indebted to mr. h.h. howorth for having called my attention to this subject, and for having given me information respecting it. i have collected the following cases. when tasmania was first colonised the natives were roughly estimated by some at 7000 and by others at 20,000. their number was soon greatly reduced, chiefly by fighting with the english and with each other. after the famous hunt by all the colonists, when the remaining natives delivered themselves up to the government, they consisted only of 120 individuals (37. all the statements here given are taken from 'the last of the tasmanians,' by j. bonwick, 1870.), who were in 1832 transported to flinders island. this island, situated between tasmania and australia, is forty miles long, and from twelve to eighteen miles broad: it seems healthy, and the natives were well treated. nevertheless, they suffered greatly in health. in 1834 they consisted (bonwick, p. 250) of forty-seven adult males, forty-eight adult females, and sixteen children, or in all of 111 souls. in 1835 only one hundred were left. as they continued rapidly to decrease, and as they themselves thought that they should not perish so quickly elsewhere, they were removed in 1847 to oyster cove in the southern part of tasmania. they then consisted (dec. 20th, 1847) of fourteen men, twenty-two women and ten children. (38. this is the statement of the governor of tasmania, sir w. denison, 'varieties of vice-regal life,' 1870, vol. i. p. 67.) but the change of site did no good. disease and death still pursued them, and in 1864 one man (who died in 1869), and three elderly women alone survived. the infertility of the women is even a more remarkable fact than the liability of all to ill-health and death. at the time when only nine women were left at oyster cove, they told mr. bonwick (p. 386), that only two had ever borne children: and these two had together produced only three children! with respect to the cause of this extraordinary state of things, dr. story remarks that death followed the attempts to civilise the natives. "if left to themselves to roam as they were wont and undisturbed, they would have reared more children, and there would have been less mortality." another careful observer of the natives, mr. davis, remarks, "the births have been few and the deaths numerous. this may have been in a great measure owing to their change of living and food; but more so to their banishment from the mainland of van diemen's land, and consequent depression of spirits" (bonwick, pp. 388, 390). similar facts have been observed in two widely different parts of australia. the celebrated explorer, mr. gregory, told mr. bonwick, that in queensland "the want of reproduction was being already felt with the blacks, even in the most recently settled parts, and that decay would set in." of thirteen aborigines from shark's bay who visited murchison river, twelve died of consumption within three months. (39. for these cases, see bonwick's 'daily life of the tasmanians,' 1870, p. 90: and the 'last of the tasmanians,' 1870, p. 386.) the decrease of the maories of new zealand has been carefully investigated by mr. fenton, in an admirable report, from which all the following statements, with one exception, are taken. (40. 'observations on the aboriginal inhabitants of new zealand,' published by the government, 1859.) the decrease in number since 1830 is admitted by every one, including the natives themselves, and is still steadily progressing. although it has hitherto been found impossible to take an actual census of the natives, their numbers were carefully estimated by residents in many districts. the result seems trustworthy, and shows that during the fourteen years, previous to 1858, the decrease was 19.42 per cent. some of the tribes, thus carefully examined, lived above a hundred miles apart, some on the coast, some inland; and their means of subsistence and habits differed to a certain extent (p. 28). the total number in 1858 was believed to be 53,700, and in 1872, after a second interval of fourteen years, another census was taken, and the number is given as only 36,359, shewing a decrease of 32.29 per cent! (41. 'new zealand,' by alex. kennedy, 1873, p. 47.) mr. fenton, after shewing in detail the insufficiency of the various causes, usually assigned in explanation of this extraordinary decrease, such as new diseases, the profligacy of the women, drunkenness, wars, etc., concludes on weighty grounds that it depends chiefly on the unproductiveness of the women, and on the extraordinary mortality of the young children (pp. 31, 34). in proof of this he shews (p. 33) that in 1844 there was one non-adult for every 2.57 adults; whereas in 1858 there was only one non-adult for every 3.27 adults. the mortality of the adults is also great. he adduces as a further cause of the decrease the inequality of the sexes; for fewer females are born than males. to this latter point, depending perhaps on a widely distinct cause, i shall return in a future chapter. mr. fenton contrasts with astonishment the decrease in new zealand with the increase in ireland; countries not very dissimilar in climate, and where the inhabitants now follow nearly similar habits. the maories themselves (p. 35) "attribute their decadence, in some measure, to the introduction of new food and clothing, and the attendant change of habits"; and it will be seen, when we consider the influence of changed conditions on fertility, that they are probably right. the diminution began between the years 1830 and 1840; and mr. fenton shews (p. 40) that about 1830, the art of manufacturing putrid corn (maize), by long steeping in water, was discovered and largely practised; and this proves that a change of habits was beginning amongst the natives, even when new zealand was only thinly inhabited by europeans. when i visited the bay of islands in 1835, the dress and food of the inhabitants had already been much modified: they raised potatoes, maize, and other agricultural produce, and exchanged them for english manufactured goods and tobacco. it is evident from many statements in the life of bishop patteson (42. 'life of j.c. patteson,' by c.m. younge, 1874; see more especially vol. i. p. 530.), that the melanesians of the new hebrides and neighbouring archipelagoes, suffered to an extraordinary degree in health, and perished in large numbers, when they were removed to new zealand, norfolk island, and other salubrious places, in order to be educated as missionaries. the decrease of the native population of the sandwich islands is as notorious as that of new zealand. it has been roughly estimated by those best capable of judging, that when cook discovered the islands in 1779, the population amounted to about 300,000. according to a loose census in 1823, the numbers then were 142,050. in 1832, and at several subsequent periods, an accurate census was officially taken, but i have been able to obtain only the following returns: native population annual rate of decrease per cent., assuming it to (except during 1832 and have been uniform between 1836, when the few the successive censuses; foreigners in the islands these censuses being taken year were included.) at irregular intervals. 1832 130,313 4.46 1836 108,579 2.47 1853 71,019 0.81 1860 67,084 2.18 1866 58,765 2.17 1872 51,531 we here see that in the interval of forty years, between 1832 and 1872, the population has decreased no less than sixty-eight per cent.! this has been attributed by most writers to the profligacy of the women, to former bloody wars, and to the severe labour imposed on conquered tribes and to newly introduced diseases, which have been on several occasions extremely destructive. no doubt these and other such causes have been highly efficient, and may account for the extraordinary rate of decrease between the years 1832 and 1836; but the most potent of all the causes seems to be lessened fertility. according to dr. ruschenberger of the u.s. navy, who visited these islands between 1835 and 1837, in one district of hawaii, only twenty-five men out of 1134, and in another district only ten out of 637, had a family with as many as three children. of eighty married women, only thirty-nine had ever borne children; and "the official report gives an average of half a child to each married couple in the whole island." this is almost exactly the same average as with the tasmanians at oyster cove. jarves, who published his history in 1843, says that "families who have three children are freed from all taxes; those having more, are rewarded by gifts of land and other encouragements." this unparalleled enactment by the government well shews how infertile the race had become. the rev. a. bishop stated in the hawaiian 'spectator' in 1839, that a large proportion of the children die at early ages, and bishop staley informs me that this is still the case, just as in new zealand. this has been attributed to the neglect of the children by the women, but it is probably in large part due to innate weakness of constitution in the children, in relation to the lessened fertility of their parents. there is, moreover, a further resemblance to the case of new zealand, in the fact that there is a large excess of male over female births: the census of 1872 gives 31,650 males to 25,247 females of all ages, that is 125.36 males for every 100 females; whereas in all civilised countries the females exceed the males. no doubt the profligacy of the women may in part account for their small fertility; but their changed habits of life is a much more probable cause, and which will at the same time account for the increased mortality, especially of the children. the islands were visited by cook in 1779, vancouver in 1794, and often subsequently by whalers. in 1819 missionaries arrived, and found that idolatry had been already abolished, and other changes effected by the king. after this period there was a rapid change in almost all the habits of life of the natives, and they soon became "the most civilised of the pacific islanders." one of my informants, mr. coan, who was born on the islands, remarks that the natives have undergone a greater change in their habits of life in the course of fifty years than englishmen during a thousand years. from information received from bishop staley, it does not appear that the poorer classes have ever much changed their diet, although many new kinds of fruit have been introduced, and the sugar-cane is in universal use. owing, however, to their passion for imitating europeans, they altered their manner of dressing at an early period, and the use of alcoholic drinks became very general. although these changes appear inconsiderable, i can well believe, from what is known with respect to animals, that they might suffice to lessen the fertility of the natives. (43. the foregoing statements are taken chiefly from the following works: jarves' 'history of the hawaiian islands,' 1843, pp. 400-407. cheever, 'life in the sandwich islands,' 1851, p. 277. ruschenberger is quoted by bonwick, 'last of the tasmanians,' 1870, p. 378. bishop is quoted by sir e. belcher, 'voyage round the world,' 1843, vol. i. p. 272. i owe the census of the several years to the kindness of mr. coan, at the request of dr. youmans of new york; and in most cases i have compared the youmans figures with those given in several of the above-named works. i have omitted the census for 1850, as i have seen two widely different numbers given.) lastly, mr. macnamara states (44. 'the indian medical gazette,' nov. 1, 1871, p. 240.) that the low and degraded inhabitants of the andaman islands, on the eastern side of the gulf of bengal, are "eminently susceptible to any change of climate: in fact, take them away from their island homes, and they are almost certain to die, and that independently of diet or extraneous influences." he further states that the inhabitants of the valley of nepal, which is extremely hot in summer, and also the various hill-tribes of india, suffer from dysentery and fever when on the plains; and they die if they attempt to pass the whole year there. we thus see that many of the wilder races of man are apt to suffer much in health when subjected to changed conditions or habits of life, and not exclusively from being transported to a new climate. mere alterations in habits, which do not appear injurious in themselves, seem to have this same effect; and in several cases the children are particularly liable to suffer. it has often been said, as mr. macnamara remarks, that man can resist with impunity the greatest diversities of climate and other changes; but this is true only of the civilised races. man in his wild condition seems to be in this respect almost as susceptible as his nearest allies, the anthropoid apes, which have never yet survived long, when removed from their native country. lessened fertility from changed conditions, as in the case of the tasmanians, maories, sandwich islanders, and apparently the australians, is still more interesting than their liability to ill-health and death; for even a slight degree of infertility, combined with those other causes which tend to check the increase of every population, would sooner or later lead to extinction. the diminution of fertility may be explained in some cases by the profligacy of the women (as until lately with the tahitians), but mr. fenton has shewn that this explanation by no means suffices with the new zealanders, nor does it with the tasmanians. in the paper above quoted, mr. macnamara gives reasons for believing that the inhabitants of districts subject to malaria are apt to be sterile; but this cannot apply in several of the above cases. some writers have suggested that the aborigines of islands have suffered in fertility and health from long continued inter-breeding; but in the above cases infertility has coincided too closely with the arrival of europeans for us to admit this explanation. nor have we at present any reason to believe that man is highly sensitive to the evil effects of inter-breeding, especially in areas so large as new zealand, and the sandwich archipelago with its diversified stations. on the contrary, it is known that the present inhabitants of norfolk island are nearly all cousins or near relations, as are the todas in india, and the inhabitants of some of the western islands of scotland; and yet they seem not to have suffered in fertility. (45. on the close relationship of the norfolk islanders, sir w. denison, 'varieties of vice-regal life,' vol. i. 1870, p. 410. for the todas, see col. marshall's work 1873, p. 110. for the western islands of scotland, dr. mitchell, 'edinburgh medical journal,' march to june, 1865.) a much more probable view is suggested by the analogy of the lower animals. the reproductive system can be shewn to be susceptible to an extraordinary degree (though why we know not) to changed conditions of life; and this susceptibility leads both to beneficial and to evil results. a large collection of facts on this subject is given in chap. xviii. of vol. ii. of my 'variation of animals and plants under domestication.' i can here give only the briefest abstract; and every one interested in the subject may consult the above work. very slight changes increase the health, vigour, and fertility of most or all organic beings, whilst other changes are known to render a large number of animals sterile. one of the most familiar cases, is that of tamed elephants not breeding in india; though they often breed in ava, where the females are allowed to roam about the forests to some extent, and are thus placed under more natural conditions. the case of various american monkeys, both sexes of which have been kept for many years together in their own countries, and yet have very rarely or never bred, is a more apposite instance, because of their relationship to man. it is remarkable how slight a change in the conditions often induces sterility in a wild animal when captured; and this is the more strange as all our domesticated animals have become more fertile than they were in a state of nature; and some of them can resist the most unnatural conditions with undiminished fertility. (46. for the evidence on this head, see 'variation of animals,' etc., vol. ii. p. 111.) certain groups of animals are much more liable than others to be affected by captivity; and generally all the species of the same group are affected in the same manner. but sometimes a single species in a group is rendered sterile, whilst the others are not so; on the other hand, a single species may retain its fertility whilst most of the others fail to breed. the males and females of some species when confined, or when allowed to live almost, but not quite free, in their native country, never unite; others thus circumstanced frequently unite but never produce offspring; others again produce some offspring, but fewer than in a state of nature; and as bearing on the above cases of man, it is important to remark that the young are apt to be weak and sickly, or malformed, and to perish at an early age. seeing how general is this law of the susceptibility of the reproductive system to changed conditions of life, and that it holds good with our nearest allies, the quadrumana, i can hardly doubt that it applies to man in his primeval state. hence if savages of any race are induced suddenly to change their habits of life, they become more or less sterile, and their young offspring suffer in health, in the same manner and from the same cause, as do the elephant and hunting-leopard in india, many monkeys in america, and a host of animals of all kinds, on removal from their natural conditions. we can see why it is that aborigines, who have long inhabited islands, and who must have been long exposed to nearly uniform conditions, should be specially affected by any change in their habits, as seems to be the case. civilised races can certainly resist changes of all kinds far better than savages; and in this respect they resemble domesticated animals, for though the latter sometimes suffer in health (for instance european dogs in india), yet they are rarely rendered sterile, though a few such instances have been recorded. (47. 'variation of animals,' etc., vol. ii. p. 16.) the immunity of civilised races and domesticated animals is probably due to their having been subjected to a greater extent, and therefore having grown somewhat more accustomed, to diversified or varying conditions, than the majority of wild animals; and to their having formerly immigrated or been carried from country to country, and to different families or sub-races having inter-crossed. it appears that a cross with civilised races at once gives to an aboriginal race an immunity from the evil consequences of changed conditions. thus the crossed offspring from the tahitians and english, when settled in pitcairn island, increased so rapidly that the island was soon overstocked; and in june 1856 they were removed to norfolk island. they then consisted of 60 married persons and 134 children, making a total of 194. here they likewise increased so rapidly, that although sixteen of them returned to pitcairn island in 1859, they numbered in january 1868, 300 souls; the males and females being in exactly equal numbers. what a contrast does this case present with that of the tasmanians; the norfolk islanders increased in only twelve and a half years from 194 to 300; whereas the tasmanians decreased during fifteen years from 120 to 46, of which latter number only ten were children. (48. these details are taken from 'the mutineers of the "bounty,"' by lady belcher, 1870; and from 'pitcairn island,' ordered to be printed by the house of commons, may 29, 1863. the following statements about the sandwich islanders are from the 'honolulu gazette,' and from mr. coan.) so again in the interval between the census of 1866 and 1872 the natives of full blood in the sandwich islands decreased by 8081, whilst the half- castes, who are believed to be healthier, increased by 847; but i do not know whether the latter number includes the offspring from the half-castes, or only the half-castes of the first generation. the cases which i have here given all relate to aborigines, who have been subjected to new conditions as the result of the immigration of civilised men. but sterility and ill-health would probably follow, if savages were compelled by any cause, such as the inroad of a conquering tribe, to desert their homes and to change their habits. it is an interesting circumstance that the chief check to wild animals becoming domesticated, which implies the power of their breeding freely when first captured, and one chief check to wild men, when brought into contact with civilisation, surviving to form a civilised race, is the same, namely, sterility from changed conditions of life. finally, although the gradual decrease and ultimate extinction of the races of man is a highly complex problem, depending on many causes which differ in different places and at different times; it is the same problem as that presented by the extinction of one of the higher animals--of the fossil horse, for instance, which disappeared from south america, soon afterwards to be replaced, within the same districts, by countless troups of the spanish horse. the new zealander seems conscious of this parallelism, for he compares his future fate with that of the native rat now almost exterminated by the european rat. though the difficulty is great to our imagination, and really great, if we wish to ascertain the precise causes and their manner of action, it ought not to be so to our reason, as long as we keep steadily in mind that the increase of each species and each race is constantly checked in various ways; so that if any new check, even a slight one, be superadded, the race will surely decrease in number; and decreasing numbers will sooner or later lead to extinction; the end, in most cases, being promptly determined by the inroads of conquering tribes. on the formation of the races of man. in some cases the crossing of distinct races has led to the formation of a new race. the singular fact that the europeans and hindoos, who belong to the same aryan stock, and speak a language fundamentally the same, differ widely in appearance, whilst europeans differ but little from jews, who belong to the semitic stock, and speak quite another language, has been accounted for by broca (49. 'on anthropology,' translation, 'anthropological review,' jan. 1868, p. 38.), through certain aryan branches having been largely crossed by indigenous tribes during their wide diffusion. when two races in close contact cross, the first result is a heterogeneous mixture: thus mr. hunter, in describing the santali or hill- tribes of india, says that hundreds of imperceptible gradations may be traced "from the black, squat tribes of the mountains to the tall olive- coloured brahman, with his intellectual brow, calm eyes, and high but narrow head"; so that it is necessary in courts of justice to ask the witnesses whether they are santalis or hindoos. (50. 'the annals of rural bengal,' 1868, p. 134.) whether a heterogeneous people, such as the inhabitants of some of the polynesian islands, formed by the crossing of two distinct races, with few or no pure members left, would ever become homogeneous, is not known from direct evidence. but as with our domesticated animals, a cross-breed can certainly be fixed and made uniform by careful selection (51. 'the variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. p. 95.) in the course of a few generations, we may infer that the free intercrossing of a heterogeneous mixture during a long descent would supply the place of selection, and overcome any tendency to reversion; so that the crossed race would ultimately become homogeneous, though it might not partake in an equal degree of the characters of the two parent-races. of all the differences between the races of man, the colour of the skin is the most conspicuous and one of the best marked. it was formerly thought that differences of this kind could be accounted for by long exposure to different climates; but pallas first shewed that this is not tenable, and he has since been followed by almost all anthropologists. (52. pallas, 'act. acad. st. petersburg,' 1780, part ii. p. 69. he was followed by rudolphi, in his 'beytrage zur anthropologie,' 1812. an excellent summary of the evidence is given by godron, 'de l'espèce,' 1859, vol. ii. p. 246, etc.) this view has been rejected chiefly because the distribution of the variously coloured races, most of whom must have long inhabited their present homes, does not coincide with corresponding differences of climate. some little weight may be given to such cases as that of the dutch families, who, as we hear on excellent authority (53. sir andrew smith, as quoted by knox, 'races of man,' 1850, p. 473.), have not undergone the least change of colour after residing for three centuries in south africa. an argument on the same side may likewise be drawn from the uniform appearance in various parts of the world of gipsies and jews, though the uniformity of the latter has been somewhat exaggerated. (54. see de quatrefages on this head, 'revue des cours scientifiques,' oct. 17, 1868, p. 731.) a very damp or a very dry atmosphere has been supposed to be more influential in modifying the colour of the skin than mere heat; but as d'orbigny in south america, and livingstone in africa, arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions with respect to dampness and dryness, any conclusion on this head must be considered as very doubtful. (55. livingstone's 'travels and researches in s. africa,' 1857, pp. 338, 339. d'orbigny, as quoted by godron, 'de l'espece,' vol. ii. p. 266.) various facts, which i have given elsewhere, prove that the colour of the skin and hair is sometimes correlated in a surprising manner with a complete immunity from the action of certain vegetable poisons, and from the attacks of certain parasites. hence it occurred to me, that negroes and other dark races might have acquired their dark tints by the darker individuals escaping from the deadly influence of the miasma of their native countries, during a long series of generations. i afterwards found that this same idea had long ago occurred to dr. wells. (56. see a paper read before the royal soc. in 1813, and published in his essays in 1818. i have given an account of dr. wells' views in the historical sketch (p. xvi.) to my 'origin of species.' various cases of colour correlated with constitutional peculiarities are given in my 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. pp. 227, 335.) it has long been known that negroes, and even mulattoes, are almost completely exempt from the yellow-fever, so destructive in tropical america. (57. see, for instance, nott and gliddon, 'types of mankind,' p. 68.) they likewise escape to a large extent the fatal intermittent fevers, that prevail along at least 2600 miles of the shores of africa, and which annually cause one-fifth of the white settlers to die, and another fifth to return home invalided. (58. major tulloch, in a paper read before the statistical society, april 20, 1840, and given in the 'athenaeum,' 1840, p. 353.) this immunity in the negro seems to be partly inherent, depending on some unknown peculiarity of constitution, and partly the result of acclimatisation. pouchet (59. 'the plurality of the human race' (translat.), 1864, p. 60.) states that the negro regiments recruited near the soudan, and borrowed from the viceroy of egypt for the mexican war, escaped the yellow-fever almost equally with the negroes originally brought from various parts of africa and accustomed to the climate of the west indies. that acclimatisation plays a part, is shewn by the many cases in which negroes have become somewhat liable to tropical fevers, after having resided for some time in a colder climate. (60. quatrefages, 'unité de l'espèce humaine,' 1861, p. 205. waitz, 'introduction to anthropology,' translat., vol. i. 1863, p. 124. livingstone gives analogous cases in his 'travels.') the nature of the climate under which the white races have long resided, likewise has some influence on them; for during the fearful epidemic of yellow fever in demerara during 1837, dr. blair found that the death-rate of the immigrants was proportional to the latitude of the country whence they had come. with the negro the immunity, as far as it is the result of acclimatisation, implies exposure during a prodigious length of time; for the aborigines of tropical america who have resided there from time immemorial, are not exempt from yellow fever; and the rev. h.b. tristram states, that there are districts in northern africa which the native inhabitants are compelled annually to leave, though the negroes can remain with safety. that the immunity of the negro is in any degree correlated with the colour of his skin is a mere conjecture: it may be correlated with some difference in his blood, nervous system, or other tissues. nevertheless, from the facts above alluded to, and from some connection apparently existing between complexion and a tendency to consumption, the conjecture seemed to me not improbable. consequently i endeavoured, with but little success (61. in the spring of 1862 i obtained permission from the director-general of the medical department of the army, to transmit to the surgeons of the various regiments on foreign service a blank table, with the following appended remarks, but i have received no returns. "as several well-marked cases have been recorded with our domestic animals of a relation between the colour of the dermal appendages and the constitution; and it being notorious that there is some limited degree of relation between the colour of the races of man and the climate inhabited by them; the following investigation seems worth consideration. namely, whether there is any relation in europeans between the colour of their hair, and their liability to the diseases of tropical countries. if the surgeons of the several regiments, when stationed in unhealthy tropical districts, would be so good as first to count, as a standard of comparison, how many men, in the force whence the sick are drawn, have dark and light-coloured hair, and hair of intermediate or doubtful tints; and if a similar account were kept by the same medical gentlemen, of all the men who suffered from malarious and yellow fevers, or from dysentery, it would soon be apparent, after some thousand cases had been tabulated, whether there exists any relation between the colour of the hair and constitutional liability to tropical diseases. perhaps no such relation would be discovered, but the investigation is well worth making. in case any positive result were obtained, it might be of some practical use in selecting men for any particular service. theoretically the result would be of high interest, as indicating one means by which a race of men inhabiting from a remote period an unhealthy tropical climate, might have become dark-coloured by the better preservation of dark-haired or dark-complexioned individuals during a long succession of generations."), to ascertain how far it holds good. the late dr. daniell, who had long lived on the west coast of africa, told me that he did not believe in any such relation. he was himself unusually fair, and had withstood the climate in a wonderful manner. when he first arrived as a boy on the coast, an old and experienced negro chief predicted from his appearance that this would prove the case. dr. nicholson, of antigua, after having attended to this subject, writes to me that dark- coloured europeans escape the yellow fever more than those that are light- coloured. mr. j.m. harris altogether denies that europeans with dark hair withstand a hot climate better than other men: on the contrary, experience has taught him in making a selection of men for service on the coast of africa, to choose those with red hair. (62. 'anthropological review,' jan. 1866, p. xxi. dr. sharpe also says, with respect to india ('man a special creation,' 1873, p. 118), "that it has been noticed by some medical officers that europeans with light hair and florid complexions suffer less from diseases of tropical countries than persons with dark hair and sallow complexions; and, so far as i know, there appear to be good grounds for this remark." on the other hand, mr. heddle, of sierra leone, "who has had more clerks killed under him than any other man," by the climate of the west african coast (w. reade, 'african sketch book,' vol. ii. p. 522), holds a directly opposite view, as does capt. burton.) as far, therefore, as these slight indications go, there seems no foundation for the hypothesis, that blackness has resulted from the darker and darker individuals having survived better during long exposure to fever-generating miasma. dr. sharpe remarks (63. 'man a special creation,' 1873, p. 119.), that a tropical sun, which burns and blisters a white skin, does not injure a black one at all; and, as he adds, this is not due to habit in the individual, for children only six or eight months old are often carried about naked, and are not affected. i have been assured by a medical man, that some years ago during each summer, but not during the winter, his hands became marked with light brown patches, like, although larger than freckles, and that these patches were never affected by sun-burning, whilst the white parts of his skin have on several occasions been much inflamed and blistered. with the lower animals there is, also, a constitutional difference in liability to the action of the sun between those parts of the skin clothed with white hair and other parts. (64. 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. pp. 336, 337.) whether the saving of the skin from being thus burnt is of sufficient importance to account for a dark tint having been gradually acquired by man through natural selection, i am unable to judge. if it be so, we should have to assume that the natives of tropical america have lived there for a much shorter time than the negroes in africa, or the papuans in the southern parts of the malay archipelago, just as the lighter-coloured hindoos have resided in india for a shorter time than the darker aborigines of the central and southern parts of the peninsula. although with our present knowledge we cannot account for the differences of colour in the races of man, through any advantage thus gained, or from the direct action of climate; yet we must not quite ignore the latter agency, for there is good reason to believe that some inherited effect is thus produced. (65. see, for instance, quatrefages ('revue des cours scientifiques,' oct. 10, 1868, p. 724) on the effects of residence in abyssinia and arabia, and other analogous cases. dr. rolle ('der mensch, seine abstammung,' etc., 1865, s. 99) states, on the authority of khanikof, that the greater number of german families settled in georgia, have acquired in the course of two generations dark hair and eyes. mr. d. forbes informs me that the quichuas in the andes vary greatly in colour, according to the position of the valleys inhabited by them.) we have seen in the second chapter that the conditions of life affect the development of the bodily frame in a direct manner, and that the effects are transmitted. thus, as is generally admitted, the european settlers in the united states undergo a slight but extraordinary rapid change of appearance. their bodies and limbs become elongated; and i hear from col. bernys that during the late war in the united states, good evidence was afforded of this fact by the ridiculous appearance presented by the german regiments, when dressed in ready-made clothes manufactured for the american market, and which were much too long for the men in every way. there is, also, a considerable body of evidence shewing that in the southern states the house-slaves of the third generation present a markedly different appearance from the field-slaves. (66. harlan, 'medical researches,' p. 532. quatrefages ('unité de l'espèce humaine,' 1861, p. 128) has collected much evidence on this head.) if, however, we look to the races of man as distributed over the world, we must infer that their characteristic differences cannot be accounted for by the direct action of different conditions of life, even after exposure to them for an enormous period of time. the esquimaux live exclusively on animal food; they are clothed in thick fur, and are exposed to intense cold and to prolonged darkness; yet they do not differ in any extreme degree from the inhabitants of southern china, who live entirely on vegetable food, and are exposed almost naked to a hot, glaring climate. the unclothed fuegians live on the marine productions of their inhospitable shores; the botocudos of brazil wander about the hot forests of the interior and live chiefly on vegetable productions; yet these tribes resemble each other so closely that the fuegians on board the "beagle" were mistaken by some brazilians for botocudos. the botocudos again, as well as the other inhabitants of tropical america, are wholly different from the negroes who inhabit the opposite shores of the atlantic, are exposed to a nearly similar climate, and follow nearly the same habits of life. nor can the differences between the races of man be accounted for by the inherited effects of the increased or decreased use of parts, except to a quite insignificant degree. men who habitually live in canoes, may have their legs somewhat stunted; those who inhabit lofty regions may have their chests enlarged; and those who constantly use certain sense-organs may have the cavities in which they are lodged somewhat increased in size, and their features consequently a little modified. with civilised nations, the reduced size of the jaws from lessened use--the habitual play of different muscles serving to express different emotions--and the increased size of the brain from greater intellectual activity, have together produced a considerable effect on their general appearance when compared with savages. (67. see prof. schaaffhausen, translat., in 'anthropological review,' oct. 1868, p. 429.) increased bodily stature, without any corresponding increase in the size of the brain, may (judging from the previously adduced case of rabbits), have given to some races an elongated skull of the dolichocephalic type. lastly, the little-understood principle of correlated development has sometimes come into action, as in the case of great muscular development and strongly projecting supra-orbital ridges. the colour of the skin and hair are plainly correlated, as is the texture of the hair with its colour in the mandans of north america. (68. mr. catlin states ('n. american indians,' 3rd ed., 1842, vol. i. p. 49) that in the whole tribe of the mandans, about one in ten or twelve of the members, of all ages and both sexes, have bright silvery grey hair, which is hereditary. now this hair is as coarse and harsh as that of a horse's mane, whilst the hair of other colours is fine and soft.) the colour also of the skin, and the odour emitted by it, are likewise in some manner connected. with the breeds of sheep the number of hairs within a given space and the number of excretory pores are related. (69. on the odour of the skin, godron, 'sur l'espèce,' tom. ii. p. 217. on the pores in the skin, dr. wilckens, 'die aufgaben der landwirth. zootechnik,' 1869, s. 7.) if we may judge from the analogy of our domesticated animals, many modifications of structure in man probably come under this principle of correlated development. we have now seen that the external characteristic differences between the races of man cannot be accounted for in a satisfactory manner by the direct action of the conditions of life, nor by the effects of the continued use of parts, nor through the principle of correlation. we are therefore led to enquire whether slight individual differences, to which man is eminently liable, may not have been preserved and augmented during a long series of generations through natural selection. but here we are at once met by the objection that beneficial variations alone can be thus preserved; and as far as we are enabled to judge, although always liable to err on this head, none of the differences between the races of man are of any direct or special service to him. the intellectual and moral or social faculties must of course be excepted from this remark. the great variability of all the external differences between the races of man, likewise indicates that they cannot be of much importance; for if important, they would long ago have been either fixed and preserved, or eliminated. in this respect man resembles those forms, called by naturalists protean or polymorphic, which have remained extremely variable, owing, as it seems, to such variations being of an indifferent nature, and to their having thus escaped the action of natural selection. we have thus far been baffled in all our attempts to account for the differences between the races of man; but there remains one important agency, namely sexual selection, which appears to have acted powerfully on man, as on many other animals. i do not intend to assert that sexual selection will account for all the differences between the races. an unexplained residuum is left, about which we can only say, in our ignorance, that as individuals are continually born with, for instance, heads a little rounder or narrower, and with noses a little longer or shorter, such slight differences might become fixed and uniform, if the unknown agencies which induced them were to act in a more constant manner, aided by long-continued intercrossing. such variations come under the provisional class, alluded to in our second chapter, which for want of a better term are often called spontaneous. nor do i pretend that the effects of sexual selection can be indicated with scientific precision; but it can be shewn that it would be an inexplicable fact if man had not been modified by this agency, which appears to have acted powerfully on innumerable animals. it can further be shewn that the differences between the races of man, as in colour, hairiness, form of features, etc., are of a kind which might have been expected to come under the influence of sexual selection. but in order to treat this subject properly, i have found it necessary to pass the whole animal kingdom in review. i have therefore devoted to it the second part of this work. at the close i shall return to man, and, after attempting to shew how far he has been modified through sexual selection, will give a brief summary of the chapters in this first part. note on the resemblances and differences in the structure and the development of the brain in man and apes by professor huxley, f.r.s. the controversy respecting the nature and the extent of the differences in the structure of the brain in man and the apes, which arose some fifteen years ago, has not yet come to an end, though the subject matter of the dispute is, at present, totally different from what it was formerly. it was originally asserted and re-asserted, with singular pertinacity, that the brain of all the apes, even the highest, differs from that of man, in the absence of such conspicuous structures as the posterior lobes of the cerebral hemispheres, with the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus minor, contained in those lobes, which are so obvious in man. but the truth that the three structures in question are as well developed in apes' as in human brains, or even better; and that it is characteristic of all the primates (if we exclude the lemurs) to have these parts well developed, stands at present on as secure a basis as any proposition in comparative anatomy. moreover, it is admitted by every one of the long series of anatomists who, of late years, have paid special attention to the arrangement of the complicated sulci and gyri which appear upon the surface of the cerebral hemispheres in man and the higher apes, that they are disposed after the very same pattern in him, as in them. every principal gyrus and sulcus of a chimpanzee's brain is clearly represented in that of a man, so that the terminology which applies to the one answers for the other. on this point there is no difference of opinion. some years since, professor bischoff published a memoir (70. 'die grosshirn-windungen des menschen;' 'abhandlungen der k. bayerischen akademie,' b. x. 1868.) on the cerebral convolutions of man and apes; and as the purpose of my learned colleague was certainly not to diminish the value of the differences between apes and men in this respect, i am glad to make a citation from him. "that the apes, and especially the orang, chimpanzee and gorilla, come very close to man in their organisation, much nearer than to any other animal, is a well known fact, disputed by nobody. looking at the matter from the point of view of organisation alone, no one probably would ever have disputed the view of linnaeus, that man should be placed, merely as a peculiar species, at the head of the mammalia and of those apes. both shew, in all their organs, so close an affinity, that the most exact anatomical investigation is needed in order to demonstrate those differences which really exist. so it is with the brains. the brains of man, the orang, the chimpanzee, the gorilla, in spite of all the important differences which they present, come very close to one another" (loc. cit. p. 101). there remains, then, no dispute as to the resemblance in fundamental characters, between the ape's brain and man's: nor any as to the wonderfully close similarity between the chimpanzee, orang and man, in even the details of the arrangement of the gyri and sulci of the cerebral hemispheres. nor, turning to the differences between the brains of the highest apes and that of man, is there any serious question as to the nature and extent of these differences. it is admitted that the man's cerebral hemispheres are absolutely and relatively larger than those of the orang and chimpanzee; that his frontal lobes are less excavated by the upward protrusion of the roof of the orbits; that his gyri and sulci are, as a rule, less symmetrically disposed, and present a greater number of secondary plications. and it is admitted that, as a rule, in man, the temporo-occipital or "external perpendicular" fissure, which is usually so strongly marked a feature of the ape's brain is but faintly marked. but it is also clear, that none of these differences constitutes a sharp demarcation between the man's and the ape's brain. in respect to the external perpendicular fissure of gratiolet, in the human brain for instance, professor turner remarks: (71. 'convolutions of the human cerebrum topographically considered,' 1866, p. 12.) "in some brains it appears simply as an indentation of the margin of the hemisphere, but, in others, it extends for some distance more or less transversely outwards. i saw it in the right hemisphere of a female brain pass more than two inches outwards; and on another specimen, also the right hemisphere, it proceeded for four-tenths of an inch outwards, and then extended downwards, as far as the lower margin of the outer surface of the hemisphere. the imperfect definition of this fissure in the majority of human brains, as compared with its remarkable distinctness in the brain of most quadrumana, is owing to the presence, in the former, of certain superficial, well marked, secondary convolutions which bridge it over and connect the parietal with the occipital lobe. the closer the first of these bridging gyri lies to the longitudinal fissure, the shorter is the external parieto-occipital fissure" (loc. cit. p. 12). the obliteration of the external perpendicular fissure of gratiolet, therefore, is not a constant character of the human brain. on the other hand, its full development is not a constant character of the higher ape's brain. for, in the chimpanzee, the more or less extensive obliteration of the external perpendicular sulcus by "bridging convolutions," on one side or the other, has been noted over and over again by prof. rolleston, mr. marshall, m. broca and professor turner. at the conclusion of a special paper on this subject the latter writes: (72. notes more especially on the bridging convolutions in the brain of the chimpanzee, 'proceedings of the royal society of edinburgh,' 1865-6.) "the three specimens of the brain of a chimpanzee, just described, prove, that the generalisation which gratiolet has attempted to draw of the complete absence of the first connecting convolution and the concealment of the second, as essentially characteristic features in the brain of this animal, is by no means universally applicable. in only one specimen did the brain, in these particulars, follow the law which gratiolet has expressed. as regards the presence of the superior bridging convolution, i am inclined to think that it has existed in one hemisphere, at least, in a majority of the brains of this animal which have, up to this time, been figured or described. the superficial position of the second bridging convolution is evidently less frequent, and has as yet, i believe, only been seen in the brain (a) recorded in this communication. the asymmetrical arrangement in the convolutions of the two hemispheres, which previous observers have referred to in their descriptions, is also well illustrated in these specimens" (pp. 8, 9). even were the presence of the temporo-occipital, or external perpendicular, sulcus, a mark of distinction between the higher apes and man, the value of such a distinctive character would be rendered very doubtful by the structure of the brain in the platyrrhine apes. in fact, while the temporo-occipital is one of the most constant of sulci in the catarrhine, or old world, apes, it is never very strongly developed in the new world apes; it is absent in the smaller platyrrhini; rudimentary in pithecia (73. flower, 'on the anatomy of pithecia monachus,' 'proceedings of the zoological society,' 1862.); and more or less obliterated by bridging convolutions in ateles. a character which is thus variable within the limits of a single group can have no great taxonomic value. it is further established, that the degree of asymmetry of the convolution of the two sides in the human brain is subject to much individual variation; and that, in those individuals of the bushman race who have been examined, the gyri and sulci of the two hemispheres are considerably less complicated and more symmetrical than in the european brain, while, in some individuals of the chimpanzee, their complexity and asymmetry become notable. this is particularly the case in the brain of a young male chimpanzee figured by m. broca. ('l'ordre des primates,' p. 165, fig. 11.) again, as respects the question of absolute size, it is established that the difference between the largest and the smallest healthy human brain is greater than the difference between the smallest healthy human brain and the largest chimpanzee's or orang's brain. moreover, there is one circumstance in which the orang's and chimpanzee's brains resemble man's, but in which they differ from the lower apes, and that is the presence of two corpora candicantia--the cynomorpha having but one. in view of these facts i do not hesitate in this year 1874, to repeat and insist upon the proposition which i enunciated in 1863: (74. 'man's place in nature,' p. 102.) "so far as cerebral structure goes, therefore, it is clear that man differs less from the chimpanzee or the orang, than these do even from the monkeys, and that the difference between the brain of the chimpanzee and of man is almost insignificant when compared with that between the chimpanzee brain and that of a lemur." in the paper to which i have referred, professor bischoff does not deny the second part of this statement, but he first makes the irrelevant remark that it is not wonderful if the brains of an orang and a lemur are very different; and secondly, goes on to assert that, "if we successively compare the brain of a man with that of an orang; the brain of this with that of a chimpanzee; of this with that of a gorilla, and so on of a hylobates, semnopithecus, cynocephalus, cercopithecus, macacus, cebus, callithrix, lemur, stenops, hapale, we shall not meet with a greater, or even as great a, break in the degree of development of the convolutions, as we find between the brain of a man and that of an orang or chimpanzee." to which i reply, firstly, that whether this assertion be true or false, it has nothing whatever to do with the proposition enunciated in 'man's place in nature,' which refers not to the development of the convolutions alone, but to the structure of the whole brain. if professor bischoff had taken the trouble to refer to p. 96 of the work he criticises, in fact, he would have found the following passage: "and it is a remarkable circumstance that though, so far as our present knowledge extends, there is one true structural break in the series of forms of simian brains, this hiatus does not lie between man and the manlike apes, but between the lower and the lowest simians, or in other words, between the old and new world apes and monkeys and the lemurs. every lemur which has yet been examined, in fact, has its cerebellum partially visible from above; and its posterior lobe, with the contained posterior cornu and hippocampus minor, more or less rudimentary. every marmoset, american monkey, old world monkey, baboon or manlike ape, on the contrary, has its cerebellum entirely hidden, posteriorly, by the cerebral lobes, and possesses a large posterior cornu with a well-developed hippocampus minor." this statement was a strictly accurate account of what was known when it was made; and it does not appear to me to be more than apparently weakened by the subsequent discovery of the relatively small development of the posterior lobes in the siamang and in the howling monkey. notwithstanding the exceptional brevity of the posterior lobes in these two species, no one will pretend that their brains, in the slightest degree, approach those of the lemurs. and if, instead of putting hapale out of its natural place, as professor bischoff most unaccountably does, we write the series of animals he has chosen to mention as follows: homo, pithecus, troglodytes, hylobates, semnopithecus, cynocephalus, cercopithecus, macacus, cebus, callithrix, hapale, lemur, stenops, i venture to reaffirm that the great break in this series lies between hapale and lemur, and that this break is considerably greater than that between any other two terms of that series. professor bischoff ignores the fact that long before he wrote, gratiolet had suggested the separation of the lemurs from the other primates on the very ground of the difference in their cerebral characters; and that professor flower had made the following observations in the course of his description of the brain of the javan loris: (75. 'transactions of the zoological society,' vol. v. 1862.) "and it is especially remarkable that, in the development of the posterior lobes, there is no approximation to the lemurine, short hemisphered brain, in those monkeys which are commonly supposed to approach this family in other respects, viz. the lower members of the platyrrhine group." so far as the structure of the adult brain is concerned, then, the very considerable additions to our knowledge, which have been made by the researches of so many investigators, during the past ten years, fully justify the statement which i made in 1863. but it has been said, that, admitting the similarity between the adult brains of man and apes, they are nevertheless, in reality, widely different, because they exhibit fundamental differences in the mode of their development. no one would be more ready than i to admit the force of this argument, if such fundamental differences of development really exist. but i deny that they do exist. on the contrary, there is a fundamental agreement in the development of the brain in men and apes. gratiolet originated the statement that there is a fundamental difference in the development of the brains of apes and that of man--consisting in this; that, in the apes, the sulci which first make their appearance are situated on the posterior region of the cerebral hemispheres, while, in the human foetus, the sulci first become visible on the frontal lobes. (76. chez tous les singes, les plis postérieurs se developpent les premiers; les plis antérieurs se developpent plus tard, aussi la vertèbre occipitale et la parietale sont-elles relativement tres-grandes chez le foetus. l'homme présente une exception remarquable quant a l'époque de l'apparition des plis frontaux, qui sont les premiers indiqués; mais le développement general du lobe frontal, envisagé seulement par rapport a son volume, suit les mêmes lois que dans les singes: gratiolet, 'mémoire sur les plis cérèbres de l'homme et des primateaux,' p. 39, tab. iv, fig. 3.) this general statement is based upon two observations, the one of a gibbon almost ready to be born, in which the posterior gyri were "well developed," while those of the frontal lobes were "hardly indicated" (77. gratiolet's words are (loc. cit. p. 39): "dans le foetus dont il s'agit les plis cérébraux posterieurs sont bien developpés, tandis que les plis du lobe frontal sont a peine indiqués." the figure, however (pl. iv, fig. 3), shews the fissure of rolando, and one of the frontal sulci plainly enough. nevertheless, m. alix, in his 'notice sur les travaux anthropologiques de gratiolet' ('mem. de la societé d'anthropologie de paris,' 1868, page 32), writes thus: "gratiolet a eu entre les mains le cerveau d'un foetus de gibbon, singe eminemment supérieur, et tellement rapproché de l'orang, que des naturalistes tres-compétents l'ont rangé parmi les anthropoides. m. huxley, par exemple, n'hesite pas sur ce point. eh bien, c'est sur le cerveau d'un foetus de gibbon que gratiolet a vu les circonvolutions du lobe temporo-sphenoidal déjà developpées lorsqu'il n'existent pas encore de plis sur le lobe frontal. il etait donc bien autorisé a dire que, chez l'homme les circonvolutions apparaissent d'a en w, tandis que chez les singes elles se developpent d'w en a."), and the other of a human foetus at the 22nd or 23rd week of uterogestation, in which gratiolet notes that the insula was uncovered, but that nevertheless "des incisures sement de lobe anterieur, une scissure peu profonde indique la separation du lobe occipital, tres-reduit, d'ailleurs dès cette époque. le reste de la surface cérébrale est encore absolument lisse." three views of this brain are given in plate ii, figs. 1, 2, 3, of the work cited, shewing the upper, lateral and inferior views of the hemispheres, but not the inner view. it is worthy of note that the figure by no means bears out gratiolet's description, inasmuch as the fissure (antero- temporal) on the posterior half of the face of the hemisphere is more marked than any of those vaguely indicated in the anterior half. if the figure is correct, it in no way justifies gratiolet's conclusion: "il y a donc entre ces cerveaux [those of a callithrix and of a gibbon] et celui du foetus humain une différence fondamental. chez celui-ci, longtemps avant que les plis temporaux apparaissent, les plis frontaux, essayent d'exister." since gratiolet's time, however, the development of the gyri and sulci of the brain has been made the subject of renewed investigation by schmidt, bischoff, pansch (78. 'ueber die typische anordnung der furchen und windungen auf den grosshirn-hemisphären des menschen und der affen,' 'archiv für anthropologie,' iii. 1868.), and more particularly by ecker (79. 'zur entwicklungs geschichte der furchen und windungen der grosshirn- hemisphären im foetus des menschen,' 'archiv für anthropologie,' iii. 1868.), whose work is not only the latest, but by far the most complete, memoir on the subject. the final results of their inquiries may be summed up as follows:-- 1. in the human foetus, the sylvian fissure is formed in the course of the third month of uterogestation. in this, and in the fourth month, the cerebral hemispheres are smooth and rounded (with the exception of the sylvian depression), and they project backwards far beyond the cerebellum. 2. the sulci, properly so called, begin to appear in the interval between the end of the fourth and the beginning of the sixth month of foetal life, but ecker is careful to point out that, not only the time, but the order, of their appearance is subject to considerable individual variation. in no case, however, are either the frontal or the temporal sulci the earliest. the first which appears, in fact, lies on the inner face of the hemisphere (whence doubtless gratiolet, who does not seem to have examined that face in his foetus, overlooked it), and is either the internal perpendicular (occipito-parietal), or the calcarine sulcus, these two being close together and eventually running into one another. as a rule the occipito- parietal is the earlier of the two. 3. at the latter part of this period, another sulcus, the "posterio- parietal," or "fissure of rolando" is developed, and it is followed, in the course of the sixth month, by the other principal sulci of the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. there is, however, no clear evidence that one of these constantly appears before the other; and it is remarkable that, in the brain at the period described and figured by ecker (loc. cit. pp. 212-213, taf. ii, figs. 1, 2, 3, 4), the antero-temporal sulcus (scissure parallele) so characteristic of the ape's brain, is as well, if not better developed than the fissure of rolando, and is much more marked than the proper frontal sulci. taking the facts as they now stand, it appears to me that the order of the appearance of the sulci and gyri in the foetal human brain is in perfect harmony with the general doctrine of evolution, and with the view that man has been evolved from some ape-like form; though there can be no doubt that form was, in many respects, different from any member of the primates now living. von baer taught us, half a century ago, that, in the course of their development, allied animals put on at first, the characters of the greater groups to which they belong, and, by degrees, assume those which restrict them within the limits of their family, genus, and species; and he proved, at the same time, that no developmental stage of a higher animal is precisely similar to the adult condition of any lower animal. it is quite correct to say that a frog passes through the condition of a fish, inasmuch as at one period of its life the tadpole has all the characters of a fish, and if it went no further, would have to be grouped among fishes. but it is equally true that a tadpole is very different from any known fish. in like manner, the brain of a human foetus, at the fifth month, may correctly be said to be, not only the brain of an ape, but that of an arctopithecine or marmoset-like ape; for its hemispheres, with their great posterior lobster, and with no sulci but the sylvian and the calcarine, present the characteristics found only in the group of the arctopithecine primates. but it is equally true, as gratiolet remarks, that, in its widely open sylvian fissure, it differs from the brain of any actual marmoset. no doubt it would be much more similar to the brain of an advanced foetus of a marmoset. but we know nothing whatever of the development of the brain in the marmosets. in the platyrrhini proper, the only observation with which i am acquainted is due to pansch, who found in the brain of a foetal cebus apella, in addition to the sylvian fissure and the deep calcarine fissure, only a very shallow antero-temporal fissure (scissure parallele of gratiolet). now this fact, taken together with the circumstance that the antero- temporal sulcus is present in such platyrrhini as the saimiri, which present mere traces of sulci on the anterior half of the exterior of the cerebral hemispheres, or none at all, undoubtedly, so far as it goes, affords fair evidence in favour of gratiolet's hypothesis, that the posterior sulci appear before the anterior, in the brains of the platyrrhini. but, it by no means follows, that the rule which may hold good for the platyrrhini extends to the catarrhini. we have no information whatever respecting the development of the brain in the cynomorpha; and, as regards the anthropomorpha, nothing but the account of the brain of the gibbon, near birth, already referred to. at the present moment there is not a shadow of evidence to shew that the sulci of a chimpanzee's, or orang's, brain do not appear in the same order as a man's. gratiolet opens his preface with the aphorism: "il est dangereux dans les sciences de conclure trop vite." i fear he must have forgotten this sound maxim by the time he had reached the discussion of the differences between men and apes, in the body of his work. no doubt, the excellent author of one of the most remarkable contributions to the just understanding of the mammalian brain which has ever been made, would have been the first to admit the insufficiency of his data had he lived to profit by the advance of inquiry. the misfortune is that his conclusions have been employed by persons incompetent to appreciate their foundation, as arguments in favour of obscurantism. (80. for example, m. l'abbe lecomte in his terrible pamphlet, 'le darwinisme et l'origine de l'homme,' 1873.) but it is important to remark that, whether gratiolet was right or wrong in his hypothesis respecting the relative order of appearance of the temporal and frontal sulci, the fact remains; that before either temporal or frontal sulci, appear, the foetal brain of man presents characters which are found only in the lowest group of the primates (leaving out the lemurs); and that this is exactly what we should expect to be the case, if man has resulted from the gradual modification of the same form as that from which the other primates have sprung. part ii. sexual selection. chapter viii. principles of sexual selection. secondary sexual characters--sexual selection--manner of action--excess of males--polygamy--the male alone generally modified through sexual selection--eagerness of the male--variability of the male--choice exerted by the female--sexual compared with natural selection--inheritance, at corresponding periods of life, at corresponding seasons of the year, and as limited by sex--relations between the several forms of inheritance--causes why one sex and the young are not modified through sexual selection-- supplement on the proportional numbers of the two sexes throughout the animal kingdom--the proportion of the sexes in relation to natural selection. with animals which have their sexes separated, the males necessarily differ from the females in their organs of reproduction; and these are the primary sexual characters. but the sexes often differ in what hunter has called secondary sexual characters, which are not directly connected with the act of reproduction; for instance, the male possesses certain organs of sense or locomotion, of which the female is quite destitute, or has them more highly-developed, in order that he may readily find or reach her; or again the male has special organs of prehension for holding her securely. these latter organs, of infinitely diversified kinds, graduate into those which are commonly ranked as primary, and in some cases can hardly be distinguished from them; we see instances of this in the complex appendages at the apex of the abdomen in male insects. unless indeed we confine the term "primary" to the reproductive glands, it is scarcely possible to decide which ought to be called primary and which secondary. the female often differs from the male in having organs for the nourishment or protection of her young, such as the mammary glands of mammals, and the abdominal sacks of the marsupials. in some few cases also the male possesses similar organs, which are wanting in the female, such as the receptacles for the ova in certain male fishes, and those temporarily developed in certain male frogs. the females of most bees are provided with a special apparatus for collecting and carrying pollen, and their ovipositor is modified into a sting for the defence of the larvae and the community. many similar cases could be given, but they do not here concern us. there are, however, other sexual differences quite unconnected with the primary reproductive organs, and it is with these that we are more especially concerned--such as the greater size, strength, and pugnacity of the male, his weapons of offence or means of defence against rivals, his gaudy colouring and various ornaments, his power of song, and other such characters. besides the primary and secondary sexual differences, such as the foregoing, the males and females of some animals differ in structures related to different habits of life, and not at all, or only indirectly, to the reproductive functions. thus the females of certain flies (culicidae and tabanidae) are blood-suckers, whilst the males, living on flowers, have mouths destitute of mandibles. (1. westwood, 'modern classification of insects,' vol. ii. 1840, p. 541. for the statement about tanais, mentioned below, i am indebted to fritz muller.) the males of certain moths and of some crustaceans (e.g. tanais) have imperfect, closed mouths, and cannot feed. the complemental males of certain cirripedes live like epiphytic plants either on the female or the hermaphrodite form, and are destitute of a mouth and of prehensile limbs. in these cases it is the male which has been modified, and has lost certain important organs, which the females possess. in other cases it is the female which has lost such parts; for instance, the female glow-worm is destitute of wings, as also are many female moths, some of which never leave their cocoons. many female parasitic crustaceans have lost their natatory legs. in some weevil- beetles (curculionidae) there is a great difference between the male and female in the length of the rostrum or snout (2. kirby and spence, 'introduction to entomology,' vol. iii. 1826, p. 309.); but the meaning of this and of many analogous differences, is not at all understood. differences of structure between the two sexes in relation to different habits of life are generally confined to the lower animals; but with some few birds the beak of the male differs from that of the female. in the huia of new zealand the difference is wonderfully great, and we hear from dr. buller (3. 'birds of new zealand,' 1872, p. 66.) that the male uses his strong beak in chiselling the larvae of insects out of decayed wood, whilst the female probes the softer parts with her far longer, much curved and pliant beak: and thus they mutually aid each other. in most cases, differences of structure between the sexes are more or less directly connected with the propagation of the species: thus a female, which has to nourish a multitude of ova, requires more food than the male, and consequently requires special means for procuring it. a male animal, which lives for a very short time, might lose its organs for procuring food through disuse, without detriment; but he would retain his locomotive organs in a perfect state, so that he might reach the female. the female, on the other hand, might safely lose her organs for flying, swimming, or walking, if she gradually acquired habits which rendered such powers useless. we are, however, here concerned only with sexual selection. this depends on the advantage which certain individuals have over others of the same sex and species solely in respect of reproduction. when, as in the cases above mentioned, the two sexes differ in structure in relation to different habits of life, they have no doubt been modified through natural selection, and by inheritance limited to one and the same sex. so again the primary sexual organs, and those for nourishing or protecting the young, come under the same influence; for those individuals which generated or nourished their offspring best, would leave, ceteris paribus, the greatest number to inherit their superiority; whilst those which generated or nourished their offspring badly, would leave but few to inherit their weaker powers. as the male has to find the female, he requires organs of sense and locomotion, but if these organs are necessary for the other purposes of life, as is generally the case, they will have been developed through natural selection. when the male has found the female, he sometimes absolutely requires prehensile organs to hold her; thus dr. wallace informs me that the males of certain moths cannot unite with the females if their tarsi or feet are broken. the males of many oceanic crustaceans, when adult, have their legs and antennae modified in an extraordinary manner for the prehension of the female; hence we may suspect that it is because these animals are washed about by the waves of the open sea, that they require these organs in order to propagate their kind, and if so, their development has been the result of ordinary or natural selection. some animals extremely low in the scale have been modified for this same purpose; thus the males of certain parasitic worms, when fully grown, have the lower surface of the terminal part of their bodies roughened like a rasp, and with this they coil round and permanently hold the females. (4. m. perrier advances this case ('revue scientifique,' feb. 1, 1873, p. 865) as one fatal to the belief in sexual election, inasmuch as he supposes that i attribute all the differences between the sexes to sexual selection. this distinguished naturalist, therefore, like so many other frenchmen, has not taken the trouble to understand even the first principles of sexual selection. an english naturalist insists that the claspers of certain male animals could not have been developed through the choice of the female! had i not met with this remark, i should not have thought it possible for any one to have read this chapter and to have imagined that i maintain that the choice of the female had anything to do with the development of the prehensile organs in the male.) when the two sexes follow exactly the same habits of life, and the male has the sensory or locomotive organs more highly developed than those of the female, it may be that the perfection of these is indispensable to the male for finding the female; but in the vast majority of cases, they serve only to give one male an advantage over another, for with sufficient time, the less well-endowed males would succeed in pairing with the females; and judging from the structure of the female, they would be in all other respects equally well adapted for their ordinary habits of life. since in such cases the males have acquired their present structure, not from being better fitted to survive in the struggle for existence, but from having gained an advantage over other males, and from having transmitted this advantage to their male offspring alone, sexual selection must here have come into action. it was the importance of this distinction which led me to designate this form of selection as sexual selection. so again, if the chief service rendered to the male by his prehensile organs is to prevent the escape of the female before the arrival of other males, or when assaulted by them, these organs will have been perfected through sexual selection, that is by the advantage acquired by certain individuals over their rivals. but in most cases of this kind it is impossible to distinguish between the effects of natural and sexual selection. whole chapters could be filled with details on the differences between the sexes in their sensory, locomotive, and prehensile organs. as, however, these structures are not more interesting than others adapted for the ordinary purposes of life i shall pass them over almost entirely, giving only a few instances under each class. there are many other structures and instincts which must have been developed through sexual selection--such as the weapons of offence and the means of defence of the males for fighting with and driving away their rivals--their courage and pugnacity--their various ornaments--their contrivances for producing vocal or instrumental music--and their glands for emitting odours, most of these latter structures serving only to allure or excite the female. it is clear that these characters are the result of sexual and not of ordinary selection, since unarmed, unornamented, or unattractive males would succeed equally well in the battle for life and in leaving a numerous progeny, but for the presence of better endowed males. we may infer that this would be the case, because the females, which are unarmed and unornamented, are able to survive and procreate their kind. secondary sexual characters of the kind just referred to, will be fully discussed in the following chapters, as being in many respects interesting, but especially as depending on the will, choice, and rivalry of the individuals of either sex. when we behold two males fighting for the possession of the female, or several male birds displaying their gorgeous plumage, and performing strange antics before an assembled body of females, we cannot doubt that, though led by instinct, they know what they are about, and consciously exert their mental and bodily powers. just as man can improve the breeds of his game-cocks by the selection of those birds which are victorious in the cockpit, so it appears that the strongest and most vigorous males, or those provided with the best weapons, have prevailed under nature, and have led to the improvement of the natural breed or species. a slight degree of variability leading to some advantage, however slight, in reiterated deadly contests would suffice for the work of sexual selection; and it is certain that secondary sexual characters are eminently variable. just as man can give beauty, according to his standard of taste, to his male poultry, or more strictly can modify the beauty originally acquired by the parent species, can give to the sebright bantam a new and elegant plumage, an erect and peculiar carriage-- so it appears that female birds in a state of nature, have by a long selection of the more attractive males, added to their beauty or other attractive qualities. no doubt this implies powers of discrimination and taste on the part of the female which will at first appear extremely improbable; but by the facts to be adduced hereafter, i hope to be able to shew that the females actually have these powers. when, however, it is said that the lower animals have a sense of beauty, it must not be supposed that such sense is comparable with that of a cultivated man, with his multiform and complex associated ideas. a more just comparison would be between the taste for the beautiful in animals, and that in the lowest savages, who admire and deck themselves with any brilliant, glittering, or curious object. from our ignorance on several points, the precise manner in which sexual selection acts is somewhat uncertain. nevertheless if those naturalists who already believe in the mutability of species, will read the following chapters, they will, i think, agree with me, that sexual selection has played an important part in the history of the organic world. it is certain that amongst almost all animals there is a struggle between the males for the possession of the female. this fact is so notorious that it would be superfluous to give instances. hence the females have the opportunity of selecting one out of several males, on the supposition that their mental capacity suffices for the exertion of a choice. in many cases special circumstances tend to make the struggle between the males particularly severe. thus the males of our migratory birds generally arrive at their places of breeding before the females, so that many males are ready to contend for each female. i am informed by mr. jenner weir, that the bird-catchers assert that this is invariably the case with the nightingale and blackcap, and with respect to the latter he can himself confirm the statement. mr. swaysland of brighton has been in the habit, during the last forty years, of catching our migratory birds on their first arrival, and he has never known the females of any species to arrive before their males. during one spring he shot thirty-nine males of ray's wagtail (budytes raii) before he saw a single female. mr. gould has ascertained by the dissection of those snipes which arrive the first in this country, that the males come before the females. and the like holds good with most of the migratory birds of the united states. (5. j.a. allen, on the 'mammals and winter birds of florida,' bulletin of comparative zoology, harvard college, p. 268.) the majority of the male salmon in our rivers, on coming up from the sea, are ready to breed before the females. so it appears to be with frogs and toads. throughout the great class of insects the males almost always are the first to emerge from the pupal state, so that they generally abound for a time before any females can be seen. (6. even with those plants in which the sexes are separate, the male flowers are generally mature before the female. as first shewn by c.k. sprengel, many hermaphrodite plants are dichogamous; that is, their male and female organs are not ready at the same time, so that they cannot be self-fertilised. now in such flowers, the pollen is in general matured before the stigma, though there are exceptional cases in which the female organs are beforehand.) the cause of this difference between the males and females in their periods of arrival and maturity is sufficiently obvious. those males which annually first migrated into any country, or which in the spring were first ready to breed, or were the most eager, would leave the largest number of offspring; and these would tend to inherit similar instincts and constitutions. it must be borne in mind that it would have been impossible to change very materially the time of sexual maturity in the females, without at the same time interfering with the period of the production of the young--a period which must be determined by the seasons of the year. on the whole there can be no doubt that with almost all animals, in which the sexes are separate, there is a constantly recurrent struggle between the males for the possession of the females. our difficulty in regard to sexual selection lies in understanding how it is that the males which conquer other males, or those which prove the most attractive to the females, leave a greater number of offspring to inherit their superiority than their beaten and less attractive rivals. unless this result does follow, the characters which give to certain males an advantage over others, could not be perfected and augmented through sexual selection. when the sexes exist in exactly equal numbers, the worst- endowed males will (except where polygamy prevails), ultimately find females, and leave as many offspring, as well fitted for their general habits of life, as the best-endowed males. from various facts and considerations, i formerly inferred that with most animals, in which secondary sexual characters are well developed, the males considerably exceeded the females in number; but this is not by any means always true. if the males were to the females as two to one, or as three to two, or even in a somewhat lower ratio, the whole affair would be simple; for the better-armed or more attractive males would leave the largest number of offspring. but after investigating, as far as possible, the numerical proportion of the sexes, i do not believe that any great inequality in number commonly exists. in most cases sexual selection appears to have been effective in the following manner. let us take any species, a bird for instance, and divide the females inhabiting a district into two equal bodies, the one consisting of the more vigorous and better-nourished individuals, and the other of the less vigorous and healthy. the former, there can be little doubt, would be ready to breed in the spring before the others; and this is the opinion of mr. jenner weir, who has carefully attended to the habits of birds during many years. there can also be no doubt that the most vigorous, best- nourished and earliest breeders would on an average succeed in rearing the largest number of fine offspring. (7. here is excellent evidence on the character of the offspring from an experienced ornithologist. mr. j.a. allen, in speaking ('mammals and winter birds of e. florida,' p. 229) of the later broods, after the accidental destruction of the first, says, that these "are found to be smaller and paler-coloured than those hatched earlier in the season. in cases where several broods are reared each year, as a general rule the birds of the earlier broods seem in all respects the most perfect and vigorous.") the males, as we have seen, are generally ready to breed before the females; the strongest, and with some species the best armed of the males, drive away the weaker; and the former would then unite with the more vigorous and better-nourished females, because they are the first to breed. (8. hermann müller has come to this same conclusion with respect to those female bees which are the first to emerge from the pupa each year. see his remarkable essay, 'anwendung der darwin'schen lehre auf bienen,' 'verh. d. v. jahrg.' xxix. p. 45.) such vigorous pairs would surely rear a larger number of offspring than the retarded females, which would be compelled to unite with the conquered and less powerful males, supposing the sexes to be numerically equal; and this is all that is wanted to add, in the course of successive generations, to the size, strength and courage of the males, or to improve their weapons. but in very many cases the males which conquer their rivals, do not obtain possession of the females, independently of the choice of the latter. the courtship of animals is by no means so simple and short an affair as might be thought. the females are most excited by, or prefer pairing with, the more ornamented males, or those which are the best songsters, or play the best antics; but it is obviously probable that they would at the same time prefer the more vigorous and lively males, and this has in some cases been confirmed by actual observation. (9. with respect to poultry, i have received information, hereafter to be given, to this effect. even with birds, such as pigeons, which pair for life, the female, as i hear from mr. jenner weir, will desert her mate if he is injured or grows weak.) thus the more vigorous females, which are the first to breed, will have the choice of many males; and though they may not always select the strongest or best armed, they will select those which are vigorous and well armed, and in other respects the most attractive. both sexes, therefore, of such early pairs would as above explained, have an advantage over others in rearing offspring; and this apparently has sufficed during a long course of generations to add not only to the strength and fighting powers of the males, but likewise to their various ornaments or other attractions. in the converse and much rarer case of the males selecting particular females, it is plain that those which were the most vigorous and had conquered others, would have the freest choice; and it is almost certain that they would select vigorous as well as attractive females. such pairs would have an advantage in rearing offspring, more especially if the male had the power to defend the female during the pairing-season as occurs with some of the higher animals, or aided her in providing for the young. the same principles would apply if each sex preferred and selected certain individuals of the opposite sex; supposing that they selected not only the more attractive, but likewise the more vigorous individuals. numerical proportion of the two sexes. i have remarked that sexual selection would be a simple affair if the males were considerably more numerous than the females. hence i was led to investigate, as far as i could, the proportions between the two sexes of as many animals as possible; but the materials are scanty. i will here give only a brief abstract of the results, retaining the details for a supplementary discussion, so as not to interfere with the course of my argument. domesticated animals alone afford the means of ascertaining the proportional numbers at birth; but no records have been specially kept for this purpose. by indirect means, however, i have collected a considerable body of statistics, from which it appears that with most of our domestic animals the sexes are nearly equal at birth. thus 25,560 births of race- horses have been recorded during twenty-one years, and the male births were to the female births as 99.7 to 100. in greyhounds the inequality is greater than with any other animal, for out of 6878 births during twelve years, the male births were to the female as 110.1 to 100. it is, however, in some degree doubtful whether it is safe to infer that the proportion would be the same under natural conditions as under domestication; for slight and unknown differences in the conditions affect the proportion of the sexes. thus with mankind, the male births in england are as 104.5, in russia as 108.9, and with the jews of livonia as 120, to 100 female births. but i shall recur to this curious point of the excess of male births in the supplement to this chapter. at the cape of good hope, however, male children of european extraction have been born during several years in the proportion of between 90 and 99 to 100 female children. for our present purpose we are concerned with the proportions of the sexes, not only at birth, but also at maturity, and this adds another element of doubt; for it is a well-ascertained fact that with man the number of males dying before or during birth, and during the first two years of infancy, is considerably larger than that of females. so it almost certainly is with male lambs, and probably with some other animals. the males of some species kill one another by fighting; or they drive one another about until they become greatly emaciated. they must also be often exposed to various dangers, whilst wandering about in eager search for the females. in many kinds of fish the males are much smaller than the females, and they are believed often to be devoured by the latter, or by other fishes. the females of some birds appear to die earlier than the males; they are also liable to be destroyed on their nests, or whilst in charge of their young. with insects the female larvae are often larger than those of the males, and would consequently be more likely to be devoured. in some cases the mature females are less active and less rapid in their movements than the males, and could not escape so well from danger. hence, with animals in a state of nature, we must rely on mere estimation, in order to judge of the proportions of the sexes at maturity; and this is but little trustworthy, except when the inequality is strongly marked. nevertheless, as far as a judgment can be formed, we may conclude from the facts given in the supplement, that the males of some few mammals, of many birds, of some fish and insects, are considerably more numerous than the females. the proportion between the sexes fluctuates slightly during successive years: thus with race-horses, for every 100 mares born the stallions varied from 107.1 in one year to 92.6 in another year, and with greyhounds from 116.3 to 95.3. but had larger numbers been tabulated throughout an area more extensive than england, these fluctuations would probably have disappeared; and such as they are, would hardly suffice to lead to effective sexual selection in a state of nature. nevertheless, in the cases of some few wild animals, as shewn in the supplement, the proportions seem to fluctuate either during different seasons or in different localities in a sufficient degree to lead to such selection. for it should be observed that any advantage, gained during certain years or in certain localities by those males which were able to conquer their rivals, or were the most attractive to the females, would probably be transmitted to the offspring, and would not subsequently be eliminated. during the succeeding seasons, when, from the equality of the sexes, every male was able to procure a female, the stronger or more attractive males previously produced would still have at least as good a chance of leaving offspring as the weaker or less attractive. polygamy. the practice of polygamy leads to the same results as would follow from an actual inequality in the number of the sexes; for if each male secures two or more females, many males cannot pair; and the latter assuredly will be the weaker or less attractive individuals. many mammals and some few birds are polygamous, but with animals belonging to the lower classes i have found no evidence of this habit. the intellectual powers of such animals are, perhaps, not sufficient to lead them to collect and guard a harem of females. that some relation exists between polygamy and the development of secondary sexual characters, appears nearly certain; and this supports the view that a numerical preponderance of males would be eminently favourable to the action of sexual selection. nevertheless many animals, which are strictly monogamous, especially birds, display strongly-marked secondary sexual characters; whilst some few animals, which are polygamous, do not have such characters. we will first briefly run through the mammals, and then turn to birds. the gorilla seems to be polygamous, and the male differs considerably from the female; so it is with some baboons, which live in herds containing twice as many adult females as males. in south america the mycetes caraya presents well-marked sexual differences, in colour, beard, and vocal organs; and the male generally lives with two or three wives: the male of the cebus capucinus differs somewhat from the female, and appears to be polygamous. (10. on the gorilla, savage and wyman, 'boston journal of natural history,' vol. v. 1845-47, p. 423. on cynocephalus, brehm, 'thierleben,' b. i. 1864, s. 77. on mycetes, rengger, 'naturgeschichte der säugethiere von paraguay,' 1830, ss. 14, 20. on cebus, brehm, ibid. s. 108.) little is known on this head with respect to most other monkeys, but some species are strictly monogamous. the ruminants are eminently polygamous, and they present sexual differences more frequently than almost any other group of mammals; this holds good, especially in their weapons, but also in other characters. most deer, cattle, and sheep are polygamous; as are most antelopes, though some are monogamous. sir andrew smith, in speaking of the antelopes of south africa, says that in herds of about a dozen there was rarely more than one mature male. the asiatic antilope saiga appears to be the most inordinate polygamist in the world; for pallas (11. pallas, 'spicilegia zoolog., fasc.' xii. 1777, p. 29. sir andrew smith, 'illustrations of the zoology of s. africa,' 1849, pl. 29, on the kobus. owen, in his 'anatomy of vertebrates' (vol. iii. 1868, p. 633) gives a table shewing incidentally which species of antelopes are gregarious.) states that the male drives away all rivals, and collects a herd of about a hundred females and kids together; the female is hornless and has softer hair, but does not otherwise differ much from the male. the wild horse of the falkland islands and of the western states of n. america is polygamous, but, except in his greater size and in the proportions of his body, differs but little from the mare. the wild boar presents well-marked sexual characters, in his great tusks and some other points. in europe and in india he leads a solitary life, except during the breeding-season; but as is believed by sir w. elliot, who has had many opportunities in india of observing this animal, he consorts at this season with several females. whether this holds good in europe is doubtful, but it is supported by some evidence. the adult male indian elephant, like the boar, passes much of his time in solitude; but as dr. campbell states, when with others, "it is rare to find more than one male with a whole herd of females"; the larger males expelling or killing the smaller and weaker ones. the male differs from the female in his immense tusks, greater size, strength, and endurance; so great is the difference in these respects that the males when caught are valued at one-fifth more than the females. (12. dr. campbell, in 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1869, p. 138. see also an interesting paper by lieut. johnstone, in 'proceedings, asiatic society of bengal,' may 1868.) the sexes of other pachydermatous animals differ very little or not at all, and, as far as known, they are not polygamists. nor have i heard of any species in the orders of cheiroptera, edentata, insectivora and rodents being polygamous, excepting that amongst the rodents, the common rat, according to some rat-catchers, lives with several females. nevertheless the two sexes of some sloths (edentata) differ in the character and colour of certain patches of hair on their shoulders. (13. dr. gray, in 'annals and magazine of natural history,' 1871, p. 302.) and many kinds of bats (cheiroptera) present well-marked sexual differences, chiefly in the males possessing odoriferous glands and pouches, and by their being of a lighter colour. (14. see dr. dobson's excellent paper in 'proceedings of the zoological society,' 1873, p. 241.) in the great order of rodents, as far as i can learn, the sexes rarely differ, and when they do so, it is but slightly in the tint of the fur. as i hear from sir andrew smith, the lion in south africa sometimes lives with a single female, but generally with more, and, in one case, was found with as many as five females; so that he is polygamous. as far as i can discover, he is the only polygamist amongst all the terrestrial carnivora, and he alone presents well-marked sexual characters. if, however, we turn to the marine carnivora, as we shall hereafter see, the case is widely different; for many species of seals offer extraordinary sexual differences, and they are eminently polygamous. thus, according to peron, the male sea-elephant of the southern ocean always possesses several females, and the sea-lion of forster is said to be surrounded by from twenty to thirty females. in the north, the male sea-bear of steller is accompanied by even a greater number of females. it is an interesting fact, as dr. gill remarks (15. 'the eared seals,' american naturalist, vol. iv. jan. 1871.), that in the monogamous species, "or those living in small communities, there is little difference in size between the males and females; in the social species, or rather those of which the males have harems, the males are vastly larger than the females." amongst birds, many species, the sexes of which differ greatly from each other, are certainly monogamous. in great britain we see well-marked sexual differences, for instance, in the wild-duck which pairs with a single female, the common blackbird, and the bullfinch which is said to pair for life. i am informed by mr. wallace that the like is true of the chatterers or cotingidae of south america, and of many other birds. in several groups i have not been able to discover whether the species are polygamous or monogamous. lesson says that birds of paradise, so remarkable for their sexual differences, are polygamous, but mr. wallace doubts whether he had sufficient evidence. mr. salvin tells me he has been led to believe that humming-birds are polygamous. the male widow-bird, remarkable for his caudal plumes, certainly seems to be a polygamist. (16. 'the ibis,' vol. iii. 1861, p. 133, on the progne widow-bird. see also on the vidua axillaris, ibid. vol. ii. 1860, p. 211. on the polygamy of the capercailzie and great bustard, see l. lloyd, 'game birds of sweden,' 1867, pp. 19, and 182. montagu and selby speak of the black grouse as polygamous and of the red grouse as monogamous.) i have been assured by mr. jenner weir and by others, that it is somewhat common for three starlings to frequent the same nest; but whether this is a case of polygamy or polyandry has not been ascertained. the gallinaceae exhibit almost as strongly marked sexual differences as birds of paradise or humming-birds, and many of the species are, as is well known, polygamous; others being strictly monogamous. what a contrast is presented between the sexes of the polygamous peacock or pheasant, and the monogamous guinea-fowl or partridge! many similar cases could be given, as in the grouse tribe, in which the males of the polygamous capercailzie and black-cock differ greatly from the females; whilst the sexes of the monogamous red grouse and ptarmigan differ very little. in the cursores, except amongst the bustards, few species offer strongly-marked sexual differences, and the great bustard (otis tarda) is said to be polygamous. with the grallatores, extremely few species differ sexually, but the ruff (machetes pugnax) affords a marked exception, and this species is believed by montagu to be a polygamist. hence it appears that amongst birds there often exists a close relation between polygamy and the development of strongly-marked sexual differences. i asked mr. bartlett, of the zoological gardens, who has had very large experience with birds, whether the male tragopan (one of the gallinaceae) was polygamous, and i was struck by his answering, "i do not know, but should think so from his splendid colours." it deserves notice that the instinct of pairing with a single female is easily lost under domestication. the wild-duck is strictly monogamous, the domestic-duck highly polygamous. the rev. w.d. fox informs me that out of some half-tamed wild-ducks, on a large pond in his neighbourhood, so many mallards were shot by the gamekeeper that only one was left for every seven or eight females; yet unusually large broods were reared. the guinea-fowl is strictly monogamous; but mr. fox finds that his birds succeed best when he keeps one cock to two or three hens. canary-birds pair in a state of nature, but the breeders in england successfully put one male to four or five females. i have noticed these cases, as rendering it probable that wild monogamous species might readily become either temporarily or permanently polygamous. too little is known of the habits of reptiles and fishes to enable us to speak of their marriage arrangements. the stickle-back (gasterosteus), however, is said to be a polygamist (17. noel humphreys, 'river gardens,' 1857.); and the male during the breeding-season differs conspicuously from the female. to sum up on the means through which, as far as we can judge, sexual selection has led to the development of secondary sexual characters. it has been shewn that the largest number of vigorous offspring will be reared from the pairing of the strongest and best-armed males, victorious in contests over other males, with the most vigorous and best-nourished females, which are the first to breed in the spring. if such females select the more attractive, and at the same time vigorous males, they will rear a larger number of offspring than the retarded females, which must pair with the less vigorous and less attractive males. so it will be if the more vigorous males select the more attractive and at the same time healthy and vigorous females; and this will especially hold good if the male defends the female, and aids in providing food for the young. the advantage thus gained by the more vigorous pairs in rearing a larger number of offspring has apparently sufficed to render sexual selection efficient. but a large numerical preponderance of males over females will be still more efficient; whether the preponderance is only occasional and local, or permanent; whether it occurs at birth, or afterwards from the greater destruction of the females; or whether it indirectly follows from the practice of polygamy. the male generally more modified than the female. throughout the animal kingdom, when the sexes differ in external appearance, it is, with rare exceptions, the male which has been the more modified; for, generally, the female retains a closer resemblance to the young of her own species, and to other adult members of the same group. the cause of this seems to lie in the males of almost all animals having stronger passions than the females. hence it is the males that fight together and sedulously display their charms before the females; and the victors transmit their superiority to their male offspring. why both sexes do not thus acquire the characters of their fathers, will be considered hereafter. that the males of all mammals eagerly pursue the females is notorious to every one. so it is with birds; but many cock birds do not so much pursue the hen, as display their plumage, perform strange antics, and pour forth their song in her presence. the male in the few fish observed seems much more eager than the female; and the same is true of alligators, and apparently of batrachians. throughout the enormous class of insects, as kirby remarks, "the law is that the male shall seek the female." (18. kirby and spence, 'introduction to entomology,' vol. iii. 1826, p. 342.) two good authorities, mr. blackwall and mr. c. spence bate, tell me that the males of spiders and crustaceans are more active and more erratic in their habits than the females. when the organs of sense or locomotion are present in the one sex of insects and crustaceans and absent in the other, or when, as is frequently the case, they are more highly developed in the one than in the other, it is, as far as i can discover, almost invariably the male which retains such organs, or has them most developed; and this shews that the male is the more active member in the courtship of the sexes. (19. one parasitic hymenopterous insect (westwood, 'modern class. of insects,' vol. ii. p. 160) forms an exception to the rule, as the male has rudimentary wings, and never quits the cell in which it is born, whilst the female has well-developed wings. audouin believes that the females of this species are impregnated by the males which are born in the same cells with them; but it is much more probable that the females visit other cells, so that close inter-breeding is thus avoided. we shall hereafter meet in various classes, with a few exceptional cases, in which the female, instead of the male, is the seeker and wooer.) the female, on the other hand, with the rarest exceptions, is less eager than the male. as the illustrious hunter (20. 'essays and observations,' edited by owen, vol. i. 1861, p. 194.) long ago observed, she generally "requires to be courted;" she is coy, and may often be seen endeavouring for a long time to escape from the male. every observer of the habits of animals will be able to call to mind instances of this kind. it is shewn by various facts, given hereafter, and by the results fairly attributable to sexual selection, that the female, though comparatively passive, generally exerts some choice and accepts one male in preference to others. or she may accept, as appearances would sometimes lead us to believe, not the male which is the most attractive to her, but the one which is the least distasteful. the exertion of some choice on the part of the female seems a law almost as general as the eagerness of the male. we are naturally led to enquire why the male, in so many and such distinct classes, has become more eager than the female, so that he searches for her, and plays the more active part in courtship. it would be no advantage and some loss of power if each sex searched for the other; but why should the male almost always be the seeker? the ovules of plants after fertilisation have to be nourished for a time; hence the pollen is necessarily brought to the female organs--being placed on the stigma, by means of insects or the wind, or by the spontaneous movements of the stamens; and in the algae, etc., by the locomotive power of the antherozooids. with lowly-organised aquatic animals, permanently affixed to the same spot and having their sexes separate, the male element is invariably brought to the female; and of this we can see the reason, for even if the ova were detached before fertilisation, and did not require subsequent nourishment or protection, there would yet be greater difficulty in transporting them than the male element, because, being larger than the latter, they are produced in far smaller numbers. so that many of the lower animals are, in this respect, analogous with plants. (21. prof. sachs ('lehrbuch der botanik,' 1870, s. 633) in speaking of the male and female reproductive cells, remarks, "verhält sich die eine bei der vereinigung activ,...die andere erscheint bei der vereinigung passiv.") the males of affixed and aquatic animals having been led to emit their fertilising element in this way, it is natural that any of their descendants, which rose in the scale and became locomotive, should retain the same habit; and they would approach the female as closely as possible, in order not to risk the loss of the fertilising element in a long passage of it through the water. with some few of the lower animals, the females alone are fixed, and the males of these must be the seekers. but it is difficult to understand why the males of species, of which the progenitors were primordially free, should invariably have acquired the habit of approaching the females, instead of being approached by them. but in all cases, in order that the males should seek efficiently, it would be necessary that they should be endowed with strong passions; and the acquirement of such passions would naturally follow from the more eager leaving a larger number of offspring than the less eager. the great eagerness of the males has thus indirectly led to their much more frequently developing secondary sexual characters than the females. but the development of such characters would be much aided, if the males were more liable to vary than the females--as i concluded they were--after a long study of domesticated animals. von nathusius, who has had very wide experience, is strongly of the same opinion. (22. 'vorträge uber viehzucht,' 1872, p. 63.) good evidence also in favour of this conclusion can be produced by a comparison of the two sexes in mankind. during the novara expedition (23. 'reise der novara: anthropolog. theil,' 1867, ss. 216-269. the results were calculated by dr. weisbach from measurements made by drs. k. scherzer and schwarz. on the greater variability of the males of domesticated animals, see my 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. 1868, p. 75.) a vast number of measurements was made of various parts of the body in different races, and the men were found in almost every case to present a greater range of variation than the women; but i shall have to recur to this subject in a future chapter. mr. j. wood (24. 'proceedings of the royal society,' vol. xvi. july 1868, pp. 519 and 524.), who has carefully attended to the variation of the muscles in man, puts in italics the conclusion that "the greatest number of abnormalities in each subject is found in the males." he had previously remarked that "altogether in 102 subjects, the varieties of redundancy were found to be half as many again as in females, contrasting widely with the greater frequency of deficiency in females before described." professor macalister likewise remarks (25. 'proc. royal irish academy,' vol. x. 1868, p. 123.) that variations in the muscles "are probably more common in males than females." certain muscles which are not normally present in mankind are also more frequently developed in the male than in the female sex, although exceptions to this rule are said to occur. dr. burt wilder (26. 'massachusetts medical society,' vol. ii. no. 3, 1868, p. 9.) has tabulated the cases of 152 individuals with supernumerary digits, of which 86 were males, and 39, or less than half, females, the remaining 27 being of unknown sex. it should not, however, be overlooked that women would more frequently endeavour to conceal a deformity of this kind than men. again, dr. l. meyer asserts that the ears of man are more variable in form than those of a woman. (27. 'archiv fur path. anat. und phys.' 1871, p. 488.) lastly the temperature is more variable in man than in woman. (28. the conclusions recently arrived at by dr. j. stockton hough, on the temperature of man, are given in the 'pop. sci. review,' jan. 1st, 1874, p. 97.) the cause of the greater general variability in the male sex, than in the female is unknown, except in so far as secondary sexual characters are extraordinarily variable, and are usually confined to the males; and, as we shall presently see, this fact is, to a certain extent, intelligible. through the action of sexual and natural selection male animals have been rendered in very many instances widely different from their females; but independently of selection the two sexes, from differing constitutionally, tend to vary in a somewhat different manner. the female has to expend much organic matter in the formation of her ova, whereas the male expends much force in fierce contests with his rivals, in wandering about in search of the female, in exerting his voice, pouring out odoriferous secretions, etc.: and this expenditure is generally concentrated within a short period. the great vigour of the male during the season of love seems often to intensify his colours, independently of any marked difference from the female. (29. prof. mantegazza is inclined to believe ('lettera a carlo darwin,' 'archivio per l'anthropologia,' 1871, p. 306) that the bright colours, common in so many male animals, are due to the presence and retention by them of the spermatic fluid; but this can hardly be the case; for many male birds, for instance young pheasants, become brightly coloured in the autumn of their first year.) in mankind, and even as low down in the organic scale as in the lepidoptera, the temperature of the body is higher in the male than in the female, accompanied in the case of man by a slower pulse. (30. for mankind, see dr. j. stockton hough, whose conclusions are given in the 'popular science review,' 1874, p. 97. see girard's observations on the lepidoptera, as given in the 'zoological record,' 1869, p. 347.) on the whole the expenditure of matter and force by the two sexes is probably nearly equal, though effected in very different ways and at different rates. from the causes just specified the two sexes can hardly fail to differ somewhat in constitution, at least during the breeding-season; and, although they may be subjected to exactly the same conditions, they will tend to vary in a different manner. if such variations are of no service to either sex, they will not be accumulated and increased by sexual or natural selection. nevertheless, they may become permanent if the exciting cause acts permanently; and in accordance with a frequent form of inheritance they may be transmitted to that sex alone in which they first appeared. in this case the two sexes will come to present permanent, yet unimportant, differences of character. for instance, mr. allen shews that with a large number of birds inhabiting the northern and southern united states, the specimens from the south are darker-coloured than those from the north; and this seems to be the direct result of the difference in temperature, light, etc., between the two regions. now, in some few cases, the two sexes of the same species appear to have been differently affected; in the agelaeus phoeniceus the males have had their colours greatly intensified in the south; whereas with cardinalis virginianus it is the females which have been thus affected; with quiscalus major the females have been rendered extremely variable in tint, whilst the males remain nearly uniform. (31. 'mammals and birds of e. florida,' pp. 234, 280, 295.) a few exceptional cases occur in various classes of animals, in which the females instead of the males have acquired well pronounced secondary sexual characters, such as brighter colours, greater size, strength, or pugnacity. with birds there has sometimes been a complete transposition of the ordinary characters proper to each sex; the females having become the more eager in courtship, the males remaining comparatively passive, but apparently selecting the more attractive females, as we may infer from the results. certain hen birds have thus been rendered more highly coloured or otherwise ornamented, as well as more powerful and pugnacious than the cocks; these characters being transmitted to the female offspring alone. it may be suggested that in some cases a double process of selection has been carried on; that the males have selected the more attractive females, and the latter the more attractive males. this process, however, though it might lead to the modification of both sexes, would not make the one sex different from the other, unless indeed their tastes for the beautiful differed; but this is a supposition too improbable to be worth considering in the case of any animal, excepting man. there are, however, many animals in which the sexes resemble each other, both being furnished with the same ornaments, which analogy would lead us to attribute to the agency of sexual selection. in such cases it may be suggested with more plausibility, that there has been a double or mutual process of sexual selection; the more vigorous and precocious females selecting the more attractive and vigorous males, the latter rejecting all except the more attractive females. but from what we know of the habits of animals, this view is hardly probable, for the male is generally eager to pair with any female. it is more probable that the ornaments common to both sexes were acquired by one sex, generally the male, and then transmitted to the offspring of both sexes. if, indeed, during a lengthened period the males of any species were greatly to exceed the females in number, and then during another lengthened period, but under different conditions, the reverse were to occur, a double, but not simultaneous, process of sexual selection might easily be carried on, by which the two sexes might be rendered widely different. we shall hereafter see that many animals exist, of which neither sex is brilliantly coloured or provided with special ornaments, and yet the members of both sexes or of one alone have probably acquired simple colours, such as white or black, through sexual selection. the absence of bright tints or other ornaments may be the result of variations of the right kind never having occurred, or of the animals themselves having preferred plain black or white. obscure tints have often been developed through natural selection for the sake of protection, and the acquirement through sexual selection of conspicuous colours, appears to have been sometimes checked from the danger thus incurred. but in other cases the males during long ages may have struggled together for the possession of the females, and yet no effect will have been produced, unless a larger number of offspring were left by the more successful males to inherit their superiority, than by the less successful: and this, as previously shewn, depends on many complex contingencies. sexual selection acts in a less rigorous manner than natural selection. the latter produces its effects by the life or death at all ages of the more or less successful individuals. death, indeed, not rarely ensues from the conflicts of rival males. but generally the less successful male merely fails to obtain a female, or obtains a retarded and less vigorous female later in the season, or, if polygamous, obtains fewer females; so that they leave fewer, less vigorous, or no offspring. in regard to structures acquired through ordinary or natural selection, there is in most cases, as long as the conditions of life remain the same, a limit to the amount of advantageous modification in relation to certain special purposes; but in regard to structures adapted to make one male victorious over another, either in fighting or in charming the female, there is no definite limit to the amount of advantageous modification; so that as long as the proper variations arise the work of sexual selection will go on. this circumstance may partly account for the frequent and extraordinary amount of variability presented by secondary sexual characters. nevertheless, natural selection will determine that such characters shall not be acquired by the victorious males, if they would be highly injurious, either by expending too much of their vital powers, or by exposing them to any great danger. the development, however, of certain structures--of the horns, for instance, in certain stags--has been carried to a wonderful extreme; and in some cases to an extreme which, as far as the general conditions of life are concerned, must be slightly injurious to the male. from this fact we learn that the advantages which favoured males derive from conquering other males in battle or courtship, and thus leaving a numerous progeny, are in the long run greater than those derived from rather more perfect adaptation to their conditions of life. we shall further see, and it could never have been anticipated, that the power to charm the female has sometimes been more important than the power to conquer other males in battle. laws of inheritance. in order to understand how sexual selection has acted on many animals of many classes, and in the course of ages has produced a conspicuous result, it is necessary to bear in mind the laws of inheritance, as far as they are known. two distinct elements are included under the term "inheritance"-- the transmission, and the development of characters; but as these generally go together, the distinction is often overlooked. we see this distinction in those characters which are transmitted through the early years of life, but are developed only at maturity or during old age. we see the same distinction more clearly with secondary sexual characters, for these are transmitted through both sexes, though developed in one alone. that they are present in both sexes, is manifest when two species, having strongly- marked sexual characters, are crossed, for each transmits the characters proper to its own male and female sex to the hybrid offspring of either sex. the same fact is likewise manifest, when characters proper to the male are occasionally developed in the female when she grows old or becomes diseased, as, for instance, when the common hen assumes the flowing tail- feathers, hackles, comb, spurs, voice, and even pugnacity of the cock. conversely, the same thing is evident, more or less plainly, with castrated males. again, independently of old age or disease, characters are occasionally transferred from the male to the female, as when, in certain breeds of the fowl, spurs regularly appear in the young and healthy females. but in truth they are simply developed in the female; for in every breed each detail in the structure of the spur is transmitted through the female to her male offspring. many cases will hereafter be given, where the female exhibits, more or less perfectly, characters proper to the male, in whom they must have been first developed, and then transferred to the female. the converse case of the first development of characters in the female and of transference to the male, is less frequent; it will therefore be well to give one striking instance. with bees the pollen- collecting apparatus is used by the female alone for gathering pollen for the larvae, yet in most of the species it is partially developed in the males to whom it is quite useless, and it is perfectly developed in the males of bombus or the humble-bee. (32. h. muller, 'anwendung der darwin'schen lehre,' etc., verh. d. n. v. jahrg., xxix. p. 42.) as not a single other hymenopterous insect, not even the wasp, which is closely allied to the bee, is provided with a pollen-collecting apparatus, we have no grounds for supposing that male bees primordially collected pollen as well as the females; although we have some reason to suspect that male mammals primordially suckled their young as well as the females. lastly, in all cases of reversion, characters are transmitted through two, three, or many more generations, and are then developed under certain unknown favourable conditions. this important distinction between transmission and development will be best kept in mind by the aid of the hypothesis of pangenesis. according to this hypothesis, every unit or cell of the body throws off gemmules or undeveloped atoms, which are transmitted to the offspring of both sexes, and are multiplied by self-division. they may remain undeveloped during the early years of life or during successive generations; and their development into units or cells, like those from which they were derived, depends on their affinity for, and union with other units or cells previously developed in the due order of growth. inheritance at corresponding periods of life. this tendency is well established. a new character, appearing in a young animal, whether it lasts throughout life or is only transient, will, in general, reappear in the offspring at the same age and last for the same time. if, on the other hand, a new character appears at maturity, or even during old age, it tends to reappear in the offspring at the same advanced age. when deviations from this rule occur, the transmitted characters much oftener appear before, than after the corresponding age. as i have dwelt on this subject sufficiently in another work (33. the 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. 1868, p. 75. in the last chapter but one, the provisional hypothesis of pangenesis, above alluded to, is fully explained.), i will here merely give two or three instances, for the sake of recalling the subject to the reader's mind. in several breeds of the fowl, the down-covered chickens, the young birds in their first true plumage, and the adults differ greatly from one another, as well as from their common parent-form, the gallus bankiva; and these characters are faithfully transmitted by each breed to their offspring at the corresponding periods of life. for instance, the chickens of spangled hamburgs, whilst covered with down, have a few dark spots on the head and rump, but are not striped longitudinally, as in many other breeds; in their first true plumage, "they are beautifully pencilled," that is each feather is transversely marked by numerous dark bars; but in their second plumage the feathers all become spangled or tipped with a dark round spot. (34. these facts are given on the high authority of a great breeder, mr. teebay; see tegetmeier's 'poultry book,' 1868, p. 158. on the characters of chickens of different breeds, and on the breeds of the pigeon, alluded to in the following paragraph, see 'variation of animals,' etc., vol. i. pp. 160, 249; vol. ii. p. 77.) hence in this breed variations have occurred at, and been transmitted to, three distinct periods of life. the pigeon offers a more remarkable case, because the aboriginal parent species does not undergo any change of plumage with advancing age, excepting that at maturity the breast becomes more iridescent; yet there are breeds which do not acquire their characteristic colours until they have moulted two, three, or four times; and these modifications of plumage are regularly transmitted. inheritance at corresponding seasons of the year. with animals in a state of nature, innumerable instances occur of characters appearing periodically at different seasons. we see this in the horns of the stag, and in the fur of arctic animals which becomes thick and white during the winter. many birds acquire bright colours and other decorations during the breeding-season alone. pallas states (35. 'novae species quadrupedum e glirium ordine,' 1778, p. 7. on the transmission of colour by the horse, see 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. i. p. 51. also vol. ii. p. 71, for a general discussion on 'inheritance as limited by sex.'), that in siberia domestic cattle and horses become lighter-coloured during the winter; and i have myself observed, and heard of similar strongly marked changes of colour, that is, from brownish cream-colour or reddish-brown to a perfect white, in several ponies in england. although i do not know that this tendency to change the colour of the coat during different seasons is transmitted, yet it probably is so, as all shades of colour are strongly inherited by the horse. nor is this form of inheritance, as limited by the seasons, more remarkable than its limitation by age or sex. inheritance as limited by sex. the equal transmission of characters to both sexes is the commonest form of inheritance, at least with those animals which do not present strongly- marked sexual differences, and indeed with many of these. but characters are somewhat commonly transferred exclusively to that sex, in which they first appear. ample evidence on this head has been advanced in my work on 'variation under domestication,' but a few instances may here be given. there are breeds of the sheep and goat, in which the horns of the male differ greatly in shape from those of the female; and these differences, acquired under domestication, are regularly transmitted to the same sex. as a rule, it is the females alone in cats which are tortoise-shell, the corresponding colour in the males being rusty-red. with most breeds of the fowl, the characters proper to each sex are transmitted to the same sex alone. so general is this form of transmission that it is an anomaly when variations in certain breeds are transmitted equally to both sexes. there are also certain sub-breeds of the fowl in which the males can hardly be distinguished from one another, whilst the females differ considerably in colour. the sexes of the pigeon in the parent-species do not differ in any external character; nevertheless, in certain domesticated breeds the male is coloured differently from the female. (36. dr. chapuis, 'le pigeon voyageur belge,' 1865, p. 87. boitard et corbie, 'les pigeons de volière,' etc., 1824, p. 173. see, also, on similar differences in certain breeds at modena, 'le variazioni dei colombi domestici,' del paolo bonizzi, 1873.) the wattle in the english carrier pigeon, and the crop in the pouter, are more highly developed in the male than in the female; and although these characters have been gained through long-continued selection by man, the slight differences between the sexes are wholly due to the form of inheritance which has prevailed; for they have arisen, not from, but rather in opposition to, the wish of the breeder. most of our domestic races have been formed by the accumulation of many slight variations; and as some of the successive steps have been transmitted to one sex alone, and some to both sexes, we find in the different breeds of the same species all gradations between great sexual dissimilarity and complete similarity. instances have already been given with the breeds of the fowl and pigeon, and under nature analogous cases are common. with animals under domestication, but whether in nature i will not venture to say, one sex may lose characters proper to it, and may thus come somewhat to resemble the opposite sex; for instance, the males of some breeds of the fowl have lost their masculine tail-plumes and hackles. on the other hand, the differences between the sexes may be increased under domestication, as with merino sheep, in which the ewes have lost their horns. again, characters proper to one sex may suddenly appear in the other sex; as in those sub-breeds of the fowl in which the hens acquire spurs whilst young; or, as in certain polish sub-breeds, in which the females, as there is reason to believe, originally acquired a crest, and subsequently transferred it to the males. all these cases are intelligible on the hypothesis of pangenesis; for they depend on the gemmules of certain parts, although present in both sexes, becoming, through the influence of domestication, either dormant or developed in either sex. there is one difficult question which it will be convenient to defer to a future chapter; namely, whether a character at first developed in both sexes, could through selection be limited in its development to one sex alone. if, for instance, a breeder observed that some of his pigeons (of which the characters are usually transferred in an equal degree to both sexes) varied into pale blue, could he by long-continued selection make a breed, in which the males alone should be of this tint, whilst the females remained unchanged? i will here only say, that this, though perhaps not impossible, would be extremely difficult; for the natural result of breeding from the pale-blue males would be to change the whole stock of both sexes to this tint. if, however, variations of the desired tint appeared, which were from the first limited in their development to the male sex, there would not be the least difficulty in making a breed with the two sexes of a different colour, as indeed has been effected with a belgian breed, in which the males alone are streaked with black. in a similar manner, if any variation appeared in a female pigeon, which was from the first sexually limited in its development to the females, it would be easy to make a breed with the females alone thus characterised; but if the variation was not thus originally limited, the process would be extremely difficult, perhaps impossible. (37. since the publication of the first edition of this work, it has been highly satisfactory to me to find the following remarks (the 'field,' sept. 1872) from so experienced a breeder as mr. tegetmeier. after describing some curious cases in pigeons, of the transmission of colour by one sex alone, and the formation of a sub- breed with this character, he says: "it is a singular circumstance that mr. darwin should have suggested the possibility of modifying the sexual colours of birds by a course of artificial selection. when he did so, he was in ignorance of these facts that i have related; but it is remarkable how very closely he suggested the right method of procedure.") on the relation between the period of development of a character and its transmission to one sex or to both sexes. why certain characters should be inherited by both sexes, and other characters by one sex alone, namely by that sex in which the character first appeared, is in most cases quite unknown. we cannot even conjecture why with certain sub-breeds of the pigeon, black striae, though transmitted through the female, should be developed in the male alone, whilst every other character is equally transferred to both sexes. why, again, with cats, the tortoise-shell colour should, with rare exceptions, be developed in the female alone. the very same character, such as deficient or supernumerary digits, colour-blindness, etc., may with mankind be inherited by the males alone of one family, and in another family by the females alone, though in both cases transmitted through the opposite as well as through the same sex. (38. references are given in my 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. p. 72.) although we are thus ignorant, the two following rules seem often to hold good--that variations which first appear in either sex at a late period of life, tend to be developed in the same sex alone; whilst variations which first appear early in life in either sex tend to be developed in both sexes. i am, however, far from supposing that this is the sole determining cause. as i have not elsewhere discussed this subject, and it has an important bearing on sexual selection, i must here enter into lengthy and somewhat intricate details. it is in itself probable that any character appearing at an early age would tend to be inherited equally by both sexes, for the sexes do not differ much in constitution before the power of reproduction is gained. on the other hand, after this power has been gained and the sexes have come to differ in constitution, the gemmules (if i may again use the language of pangenesis) which are cast off from each varying part in the one sex would be much more likely to possess the proper affinities for uniting with the tissues of the same sex, and thus becoming developed, than with those of the opposite sex. i was first led to infer that a relation of this kind exists, from the fact that whenever and in whatever manner the adult male differs from the adult female, he differs in the same manner from the young of both sexes. the generality of this fact is quite remarkable: it holds good with almost all mammals, birds, amphibians, and fishes; also with many crustaceans, spiders, and some few insects, such as certain orthoptera and libellulae. in all these cases the variations, through the accumulation of which the male acquired his proper masculine characters, must have occurred at a somewhat late period of life; otherwise the young males would have been similarly characterised; and conformably with our rule, the variations are transmitted to and developed in the adult males alone. when, on the other hand, the adult male closely resembles the young of both sexes (these, with rare exceptions, being alike), he generally resembles the adult female; and in most of these cases the variations through which the young and old acquired their present characters, probably occurred, according to our rule, during youth. but there is here room for doubt, for characters are sometimes transferred to the offspring at an earlier age than that at which they first appeared in the parents, so that the parents may have varied when adult, and have transferred their characters to their offspring whilst young. there are, moreover, many animals, in which the two sexes closely resemble each other, and yet both differ from their young: and here the characters of the adults must have been acquired late in life; nevertheless, these characters, in apparent contradiction to our rule, are transferred to both sexes. we must not however, overlook the possibility or even probability of successive variations of the same nature occurring, under exposure to similar conditions, simultaneously in both sexes at a rather late period of life; and in this case the variations would be transferred to the offspring of both sexes at a corresponding late age; and there would then be no real contradiction to the rule that variations occurring late in life are transferred exclusively to the sex in which they first appeared. this latter rule seems to hold true more generally than the second one, namely, that variations which occur in either sex early in life tend to be transferred to both sexes. as it was obviously impossible even to estimate in how large a number of cases throughout the animal kingdom these two propositions held good, it occurred to me to investigate some striking or crucial instances, and to rely on the result. an excellent case for investigation is afforded by the deer family. in all the species, but one, the horns are developed only in the males, though certainly transmitted through the females, and capable of abnormal development in them. in the reindeer, on the other hand, the female is provided with horns; so that in this species, the horns ought, according to our rule, to appear early in life, long before the two sexes are mature and have come to differ much in constitution. in all the other species the horns ought to appear later in life, which would lead to their development in that sex alone, in which they first appeared in the progenitor of the whole family. now in seven species, belonging to distinct sections of the family and inhabiting different regions, in which the stags alone bear horns, i find that the horns first appear at periods, varying from nine months after birth in the roebuck, to ten, twelve or even more months in the stags of the six other and larger species. (39. i am much obliged to mr. cupples for having made enquiries for me in regard to the roebuck and red deer of scotland from mr. robertson, the experienced head-forester to the marquis of breadalbane. in regard to fallow-deer, i have to thank mr. eyton and others for information. for the cervus alces of n. america, see 'land and water,' 1868, pp. 221 and 254; and for the c. virginianus and strongyloceros of the same continent, see j.d. caton, in 'ottawa acad. of nat. sc.' 1868, p. 13. for cervus eldi of pegu, see lieut. beaven, 'proccedings of the zoological society,' 1867, p. 762.) but with the reindeer the case is widely different; for, as i hear from prof. nilsson, who kindly made special enquiries for me in lapland, the horns appear in the young animals within four or five weeks after birth, and at the same time in both sexes. so that here we have a structure, developed at a most unusually early age in one species of the family, and likewise common to both sexes in this one species alone. in several kinds of antelopes, only the males are provided with horns, whilst in the greater number both sexes bear horns. with respect to the period of development, mr. blyth informs me that there was at one time in the zoological gardens a young koodoo (ant. strepsiceros), of which the males alone are horned, and also the young of a closely-allied species, the eland (ant. oreas), in which both sexes are horned. now it is in strict conformity with our rule, that in the young male koodoo, although ten months old, the horns were remarkably small, considering the size ultimately attained by them; whilst in the young male eland, although only three months old, the horns were already very much larger than in the koodoo. it is also a noticeable fact that in the prong-horned antelope (40. antilocapra americana. i have to thank dr. canfield for information with respect to the horns of the female: see also his paper in 'proceedings of the zoological society,' 1866, p. 109. also owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 627), only a few of the females, about one in five, have horns, and these are in a rudimentary state, though sometimes above four inches long: so that as far as concerns the possession of horns by the males alone, this species is in an intermediate condition, and the horns do not appear until about five or six months after birth. therefore in comparison with what little we know of the development of the horns in other antelopes, and from what we do know with respect to the horns of deer, cattle, etc., those of the prong-horned antelope appear at an intermediate period of life,--that is, not very early, as in cattle and sheep, nor very late, as in the larger deer and antelopes. the horns of sheep, goats, and cattle, which are well developed in both sexes, though not quite equal in size, can be felt, or even seen, at birth or soon afterwards. (41. i have been assured that the horns of the sheep in north wales can always be felt, and are sometimes even an inch in length, at birth. youatt says ('cattle,' 1834, p. 277), that the prominence of the frontal bone in cattle penetrates the cutis at birth, and that the horny matter is soon formed over it.) our rule, however, seems to fail in some breeds of sheep, for instance merinos, in which the rams alone are horned; for i cannot find on enquiry (42. i am greatly indebted to prof. victor carus for having made enquiries for me, from the highest authorities, with respect to the merino sheep of saxony. on the guinea coast of africa there is, however, a breed of sheep in which, as with merinos, the rams alone bear horns; and mr. winwood reade informs me that in one case observed by him, a young ram, born on feb. 10th, first shewed horns on march 6th, so that in this instance, in conformity with rule, the development of the horns occurred at a later period of life than in welsh sheep, in which both sexes are horned.), that the horns are developed later in life in this breed than in ordinary sheep in which both sexes are horned. but with domesticated sheep the presence or absence of horns is not a firmly fixed character; for a certain proportion of the merino ewes bear small horns, and some of the rams are hornless; and in most breeds hornless ewes are occasionally produced. dr. w. marshall has lately made a special study of the protuberances so common on the heads of birds (43. 'über die knochernen schädelhöcker der vögel,' in the 'niederland. archiv fur zoologie,' b.i. heft 2, 1872.), and he comes to the following conclusion:--that with those species in which they are confined to the males, they are developed late in life; whereas with those species in which they are common to the two sexes, they are developed at a very early period. this is certainly a striking confirmation of my two laws of inheritance. in most of the species of the splendid family of the pheasants, the males differ conspicuously from the females, and they acquire their ornaments at a rather late period of life. the eared pheasant (crossoptilon auritum), however, offers a remarkable exception, for both sexes possess the fine caudal plumes, the large ear-tufts and the crimson velvet about the head; i find that all these characters appear very early in life in accordance with rule. the adult male can, however, be distinguished from the adult female by the presence of spurs; and conformably with our rule, these do not begin to be developed before the age of six months, as i am assured by mr. bartlett, and even at this age, the two sexes can hardly be distinguished. (44. in the common peacock (pavo cristatus) the male alone possesses spurs, whilst both sexes of the java peacock (p. muticus) offer the unusual case of being furnished with spurs. hence i fully expected that in the latter species they would have been developed earlier in life than in the common peacock; but m. hegt of amsterdam informs me, that with young birds of the previous year, of both species, compared on april 23rd, 1869, there was no difference in the development of the spurs. the spurs, however, were as yet represented merely by slight knobs or elevations. i presume that i should have been informed if any difference in the rate of development had been observed subsequently.) the male and female peacock differ conspicuously from each other in almost every part of their plumage, except in the elegant head-crest, which is common to both sexes; and this is developed very early in life, long before the other ornaments, which are confined to the male. the wild-duck offers an analogous case, for the beautiful green speculum on the wings is common to both sexes, though duller and somewhat smaller in the female, and it is developed early in life, whilst the curled tail-feathers and other ornaments of the male are developed later. (45. in some other species of the duck family the speculum differs in a greater degree in the two sexes; but i have not been able to discover whether its full development occurs later in life in the males of such species, than in the male of the common duck, as ought to be the case according to our rule. with the allied mergus cucullatus we have, however, a case of this kind: the two sexes differ conspicuously in general plumage, and to a considerable degree in the speculum, which is pure white in the male and greyish-white in the female. now the young males at first entirely resemble the females, and have a greyish-white speculum, which becomes pure white at an earlier age than that at which the adult male acquires his other and more strongly-marked sexual differences: see audubon, 'ornithological biography,' vol. iii. 1835, pp. 249-250.) between such extreme cases of close sexual resemblance and wide dissimilarity, as those of the crossoptilon and peacock, many intermediate ones could be given, in which the characters follow our two rules in their order of development. as most insects emerge from the pupal state in a mature condition, it is doubtful whether the period of development can determine the transference of their characters to one or to both sexes. but we do not know that the coloured scales, for instance, in two species of butterflies, in one of which the sexes differ in colour, whilst in the other they are alike, are developed at the same relative age in the cocoon. nor do we know whether all the scales are simultaneously developed on the wings of the same species of butterfly, in which certain coloured marks are confined to one sex, whilst others are common to both sexes. a difference of this kind in the period of development is not so improbable as it may at first appear; for with the orthoptera, which assume their adult state, not by a single metamorphosis, but by a succession of moults, the young males of some species at first resemble the females, and acquire their distinctive masculine characters only at a later moult. strictly analogous cases occur at the successive moults of certain male crustaceans. we have as yet considered the transference of characters, relatively to their period of development, only in species in a natural state; we will now turn to domesticated animals, and first touch on monstrosities and diseases. the presence of supernumerary digits, and the absence of certain phalanges, must be determined at an early embryonic period--the tendency to profuse bleeding is at least congenital, as is probably colour-blindness-- yet these peculiarities, and other similar ones, are often limited in their transmission to one sex; so that the rule that characters, developed at an early period, tend to be transmitted to both sexes, here wholly fails. but this rule, as before remarked, does not appear to be nearly so general as the converse one, namely, that characters which appear late in life in one sex are transmitted exclusively to the same sex. from the fact of the above abnormal peculiarities becoming attached to one sex, long before the sexual functions are active, we may infer that there must be some difference between the sexes at an extremely early age. with respect to sexually-limited diseases, we know too little of the period at which they originate, to draw any safe conclusion. gout, however, seems to fall under our rule, for it is generally caused by intemperance during manhood, and is transmitted from the father to his sons in a much more marked manner than to his daughters. in the various domestic breeds of sheep, goats, and cattle, the males differ from their respective females in the shape or development of their horns, forehead, mane, dewlap, tail, and hump on the shoulders; and these peculiarities, in accordance with our rule, are not fully developed until a rather late period of life. the sexes of dogs do not differ, except that in certain breeds, especially in the scotch deer-hound, the male is much larger and heavier than the female; and, as we shall see in a future chapter, the male goes on increasing in size to an unusually late period of life, which, according to rule, will account for his increased size being transmitted to his male offspring alone. on the other hand, the tortoise- shell colour, which is confined to female cats, is quite distinct at birth, and this case violates the rule. there is a breed of pigeons in which the males alone are streaked with black, and the streaks can be detected even in the nestlings; but they become more conspicuous at each successive moult, so that this case partly opposes and partly supports the rule. with the english carrier and pouter pigeons, the full development of the wattle and the crop occurs rather late in life, and conformably with the rule, these characters are transmitted in full perfection to the males alone. the following cases perhaps come within the class previously alluded to, in which both sexes have varied in the same manner at a rather late period of life, and have consequently transferred their new characters to both sexes at a corresponding late period; and if so, these cases are not opposed to our rule:--there exist sub-breeds of the pigeon, described by neumeister (46. 'das ganze der taubenzucht,' 1837, ss. 21, 24. for the case of the streaked pigeons, see dr. chapuis, 'le pigeon voyageur belge,' 1865, p. 87.), in which both sexes change their colour during two or three moults (as is likewise the case with the almond tumbler); nevertheless, these changes, though occurring rather late in life, are common to both sexes. one variety of the canary-bird, namely the london prize, offers a nearly analogous case. with the breeds of the fowl the inheritance of various characters by one or both sexes, seems generally determined by the period at which such characters are developed. thus in all the many breeds in which the adult male differs greatly in colour from the female, as well as from the wild parent-species, he differs also from the young male, so that the newly- acquired characters must have appeared at a rather late period of life. on the other hand, in most of the breeds in which the two sexes resemble each other, the young are coloured in nearly the same manner as their parents, and this renders it probable that their colours first appeared early in life. we have instances of this fact in all black and white breeds, in which the young and old of both sexes are alike; nor can it be maintained that there is something peculiar in a black or white plumage, which leads to its transference to both sexes; for the males alone of many natural species are either black or white, the females being differently coloured. with the so-called cuckoo sub-breeds of the fowl, in which the feathers are transversely pencilled with dark stripes, both sexes and the chickens are coloured in nearly the same manner. the laced plumage of the sebright bantam is the same in both sexes, and in the young chickens the wing- feathers are distinctly, though imperfectly laced. spangled hamburgs, however, offer a partial exception; for the two sexes, though not quite alike, resemble each other more closely than do the sexes of the aboriginal parent-species; yet they acquire their characteristic plumage late in life, for the chickens are distinctly pencilled. with respect to other characters besides colour, in the wild-parent species and in most of the domestic breeds, the males alone possess a well-developed comb; but in the young of the spanish fowl it is largely developed at a very early age, and, in accordance with this early development in the male, it is of unusual size in the adult female. in the game breeds pugnacity is developed at a wonderfully early age, of which curious proofs could be given; and this character is transmitted to both sexes, so that the hens, from their extreme pugnacity, are now generally exhibited in separate pens. with the polish breeds the bony protuberance of the skull which supports the crest is partially developed even before the chickens are hatched, and the crest itself soon begins to grow, though at first feebly (47. for full particulars and references on all these points respecting the several breeds of the fowl, see 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. i. pp. 250, 256. in regard to the higher animals, the sexual differences which have arisen under domestication are described in the same work under the head of each species.); and in this breed the adults of both sexes are characterised by a great bony protuberance and an immense crest. finally, from what we have now seen of the relation which exists in many natural species and domesticated races, between the period of the development of their characters and the manner of their transmission--for example, the striking fact of the early growth of the horns in the reindeer, in which both sexes bear horns, in comparison with their much later growth in the other species in which the male alone bears horns--we may conclude that one, though not the sole cause of characters being exclusively inherited by one sex, is their development at a late age. and secondly, that one, though apparently a less efficient cause of characters being inherited by both sexes, is their development at an early age, whilst the sexes differ but little in constitution. it appears, however, that some difference must exist between the sexes even during a very early embryonic period, for characters developed at this age not rarely become attached to one sex. summary and concluding remarks. from the foregoing discussion on the various laws of inheritance, we learn that the characters of the parents often, or even generally, tend to become developed in the offspring of the same sex, at the same age, and periodically at the same season of the year, in which they first appeared in the parents. but these rules, owing to unknown causes, are far from being fixed. hence during the modification of a species, the successive changes may readily be transmitted in different ways; some to one sex, and some to both; some to the offspring at one age, and some to the offspring at all ages. not only are the laws of inheritance extremely complex, but so are the causes which induce and govern variability. the variations thus induced are preserved and accumulated by sexual selection, which is in itself an extremely complex affair, depending, as it does, on the ardour in love, the courage, and the rivalry of the males, as well as on the powers of perception, the taste, and will of the female. sexual selection will also be largely dominated by natural selection tending towards the general welfare of the species. hence the manner in which the individuals of either or both sexes have been affected through sexual selection cannot fail to be complex in the highest degree. when variations occur late in life in one sex, and are transmitted to the same sex at the same age, the other sex and the young are left unmodified. when they occur late in life, but are transmitted to both sexes at the same age, the young alone are left unmodified. variations, however, may occur at any period of life in one sex or in both, and be transmitted to both sexes at all ages, and then all the individuals of the species are similarly modified. in the following chapters it will be seen that all these cases frequently occur in nature. sexual selection can never act on any animal before the age for reproduction arrives. from the great eagerness of the male it has generally acted on this sex and not on the females. the males have thus become provided with weapons for fighting with their rivals, with organs for discovering and securely holding the female, and for exciting or charming her. when the sexes differ in these respects, it is also, as we have seen, an extremely general law that the adult male differs more or less from the young male; and we may conclude from this fact that the successive variations, by which the adult male became modified, did not generally occur much before the age for reproduction. whenever some or many of the variations occurred early in life, the young males would partake more or less of the characters of the adult males; and differences of this kind between the old and young males may be observed in many species of animals. it is probable that young male animals have often tended to vary in a manner which would not only have been of no use to them at an early age, but would have been actually injurious--as by acquiring bright colours, which would render them conspicuous to their enemies, or by acquiring structures, such as great horns, which would expend much vital force in their development. variations of this kind occurring in the young males would almost certainly be eliminated through natural selection. with the adult and experienced males, on the other hand, the advantages derived from the acquisition of such characters, would more than counterbalance some exposure to danger, and some loss of vital force. as variations which give to the male a better chance of conquering other males, or of finding, securing, or charming the opposite sex, would, if they happened to arise in the female, be of no service to her, they would not be preserved in her through sexual selection. we have also good evidence with domesticated animals, that variations of all kinds are, if not carefully selected, soon lost through intercrossing and accidental deaths. consequently in a state of nature, if variations of the above kind chanced to arise in the female line, and to be transmitted exclusively in this line, they would be extremely liable to be lost. if, however, the females varied and transmitted their newly acquired characters to their offspring of both sexes, the characters which were advantageous to the males would be preserved by them through sexual selection, and the two sexes would in consequence be modified in the same manner, although such characters were of no use to the females: but i shall hereafter have to recur to these more intricate contingencies. lastly, the females may acquire, and apparently have often acquired by transference, characters from the male sex. as variations occurring later in life, and transmitted to one sex alone, have incessantly been taken advantage of and accumulated through sexual selection in relation to the reproduction of the species; therefore it appears, at first sight, an unaccountable fact that similar variations have not frequently been accumulated through natural selection, in relation to the ordinary habits of life. if this had occurred, the two sexes would often have been differently modified, for the sake, for instance, of capturing prey or of escaping from danger. differences of this kind between the two sexes do occasionally occur, especially in the lower classes. but this implies that the two sexes follow different habits in their struggles for existence, which is a rare circumstance with the higher animals. the case, however, is widely different with the reproductive functions, in which respect the sexes necessarily differ. for variations in structure which are related to these functions, have often proved of value to one sex, and from having arisen at a late period of life, have been transmitted to one sex alone; and such variations, thus preserved and transmitted, have given rise to secondary sexual characters. in the following chapters, i shall treat of the secondary sexual characters in animals of all classes, and shall endeavour in each case to apply the principles explained in the present chapter. the lowest classes will detain us for a very short time, but the higher animals, especially birds, must be treated at considerable length. it should be borne in mind that for reasons already assigned, i intend to give only a few illustrative instances of the innumerable structures by the aid of which the male finds the female, or, when found, holds her. on the other hand, all structures and instincts by the aid of which the male conquers other males, and by which he allures or excites the female, will be fully discussed, as these are in many ways the most interesting. supplement on the proportional numbers of the two sexes in animals belonging to various classes. as no one, as far as i can discover, has paid attention to the relative numbers of the two sexes throughout the animal kingdom, i will here give such materials as i have been able to collect, although they are extremely imperfect. they consist in only a few instances of actual enumeration, and the numbers are not very large. as the proportions are known with certainty only in mankind, i will first give them as a standard of comparison. man. in england during ten years (from 1857 to 1866) the average number of children born alive yearly was 707,120, in the proportion of 104.5 males to 100 females. but in 1857 the male births throughout england were as 105.2, and in 1865 as 104.0 to 100. looking to separate districts, in buckinghamshire (where about 5000 children are annually born) the mean proportion of male to female births, during the whole period of the above ten years, was as 102.8 to 100; whilst in n. wales (where the average annual births are 12,873) it was as high as 106.2 to 100. taking a still smaller district, viz., rutlandshire (where the annual births average only 739), in 1864 the male births were as 114.6, and in 1862 as only 97.0 to 100; but even in this small district the average of the 7385 births during the whole ten years, was as 104.5 to 100: that is in the same ratio as throughout england. (48. 'twenty-ninth annual report of the registrar- general for 1866.' in this report (p. xii.) a special decennial table is given.) the proportions are sometimes slightly disturbed by unknown causes; thus prof. faye states "that in some districts of norway there has been during a decennial period a steady deficiency of boys, whilst in others the opposite condition has existed." in france during forty-four years the male to the female births have been as 106.2 to 100; but during this period it has occurred five times in one department, and six times in another, that the female births have exceeded the males. in russia the average proportion is as high as 108.9, and in philadelphia in the united states as 110.5 to 100. (49. for norway and russia, see abstract of prof. faye's researches, in 'british and foreign medico-chirurg. review,' april 1867, pp. 343, 345. for france, the 'annuaire pour l'an 1867,' p. 213. for philadelphia, dr. stockton hough, 'social science assoc.' 1874. for the cape of good hope, quetelet as quoted by dr. h.h. zouteveen, in the dutch translation of this work (vol. i. p. 417), where much information is given on the proportion of the sexes.) the average for europe, deduced by bickes from about seventy million births, is 106 males to 100 females. on the other hand, with white children born at the cape of good hope, the proportion of males is so low as to fluctuate during successive years between 90 and 99 males for every 100 females. it is a singular fact that with jews the proportion of male births is decidedly larger than with christians: thus in prussia the proportion is as 113, in breslau as 114, and in livonia as 120 to 100; the christian births in these countries being the same as usual, for instance, in livonia as 104 to 100. (50. in regard to the jews, see m. thury, 'la loi de production des sexes,' 1863, p. 25.) prof. faye remarks that "a still greater preponderance of males would be met with, if death struck both sexes in equal proportion in the womb and during birth. but the fact is, that for every 100 still-born females, we have in several countries from 134.6 to 144.9 still-born males. during the first four or five years of life, also, more male children die than females, for example in england, during the first year, 126 boys die for every 100 girls--a proportion which in france is still more unfavourable." (51. 'british and foreign medico-chirurg. review,' april 1867, p. 343. dr. stark also remarks ('tenth annual report of births, deaths, etc., in scotland,' 1867, p. xxviii.) that "these examples may suffice to show that, at almost every stage of life, the males in scotland have a greater liability to death and a higher death-rate than the females. the fact, however, of this peculiarity being most strongly developed at that infantile period of life when the dress, food, and general treatment of both sexes are alike, seems to prove that the higher male death-rate is an impressed, natural, and constitutional peculiarity due to sex alone.") dr. stockton hough accounts for these facts in part by the more frequent defective development of males than of females. we have before seen that the male sex is more variable in structure than the female; and variations in important organs would generally be injurious. but the size of the body, and especially of the head, being greater in male than female infants is another cause: for the males are thus more liable to be injured during parturition. consequently the still-born males are more numerous; and, as a highly competent judge, dr. crichton browne (52. 'west riding lunatic asylum reports,' vol. i. 1871, p. 8. sir j. simpson has proved that the head of the male infant exceeds that of the female by 3/8ths of an inch in circumference, and by 1/8th in transverse diameter. quetelet has shewn that woman is born smaller than man; see dr. duncan, 'fecundity, fertility, and sterility,' 1871, p. 382.), believes, male infants often suffer in health for some years after birth. owing to this excess in the death-rate of male children, both at birth and for some time subsequently, and owing to the exposure of grown men to various dangers, and to their tendency to emigrate, the females in all old-settled countries, where statistical records have been kept, are found to preponderate considerably over the males. (53. with the savage guaranys of paraguay, according to the accurate azara ('voyages dans l'amerique merid.' tom. ii. 1809, pp. 60, 179), the women are to the men in the proportion of 14 to 13.) it seems at first sight a mysterious fact that in different nations, under different conditions and climates, in naples, prussia, westphalia, holland, france, england and the united states, the excess of male over female births is less when they are illegitimate than when legitimate. (54. babbage, 'edinburgh journal of science,' 1829, vol. i. p. 88; also p. 90, on still-born children. on illegitimate children in england, see 'report of registrar-general for 1866,' p. xv.) this has been explained by different writers in many different ways, as from the mothers being generally young, from the large proportion of first pregnancies, etc. but we have seen that male infants, from the large size of their heads, suffer more than female infants during parturition; and as the mothers of illegitimate children must be more liable than other women to undergo bad labours, from various causes, such as attempts at concealment by tight lacing, hard work, distress of mind, etc., their male infants would proportionably suffer. and this probably is the most efficient of all the causes of the proportion of males to females born alive being less amongst illegitimate children than amongst the legitimate. with most animals the greater size of the adult male than of the female, is due to the stronger males having conquered the weaker in their struggles for the possession of the females, and no doubt it is owing to this fact that the two sexes of at least some animals differ in size at birth. thus we have the curious fact that we may attribute the more frequent deaths of male than female infants, especially amongst the illegitimate, at least in part to sexual selection. it has often been supposed that the relative age of the two parents determine the sex of the offspring; and prof. leuckart (55. leuckart, in wagner 'handwörterbuch der phys.' b. iv. 1853, s. 774.) has advanced what he considers sufficient evidence, with respect to man and certain domesticated animals, that this is one important though not the sole factor in the result. so again the period of impregnation relatively to the state of the female has been thought by some to be the efficient cause; but recent observations discountenance this belief. according to dr. stockton hough (56. 'social science association of philadelphia,' 1874.), the season of the year, the poverty or wealth of the parents, residence in the country or in cities, the crossing of foreign immigrants, etc., all influence the proportion of the sexes. with mankind, polygamy has also been supposed to lead to the birth of a greater proportion of female infants; but dr. j. campbell (57. 'anthropological review,' april 1870, p. cviii.) carefully attended to this subject in the harems of siam, and concludes that the proportion of male to female births is the same as from monogamous unions. hardly any animal has been rendered so highly polygamous as the english race-horse, and we shall immediately see that his male and female offspring are almost exactly equal in number. i will now give the facts which i have collected with respect to the proportional numbers of the sexes of various animals; and will then briefly discuss how far selection has come into play in determining the result. horses. mr. tegetmeier has been so kind as to tabulate for me from the 'racing calendar' the births of race-horses during a period of twenty-one years, viz., from 1846 to 1867; 1849 being omitted, as no returns were that year published. the total births were 25,560 (58. during eleven years a record was kept of the number of mares which proved barren or prematurely slipped their foals; and it deserves notice, as shewing how infertile these highly- nurtured and rather closely-interbred animals have become, that not far from one-third of the mares failed to produce living foals. thus during 1866, 809 male colts and 816 female colts were born, and 743 mares failed to produce offspring. during 1867, 836 males and 902 females were born, and 794 mares failed.), consisting of 12,763 males and 12,797 females, or in the proportion of 99.7 males to 100 females. as these numbers are tolerably large, and as they are drawn from all parts of england, during several years, we may with much confidence conclude that with the domestic horse, or at least with the race-horse, the two sexes are produced in almost equal numbers. the fluctuations in the proportions during successive years are closely like those which occur with mankind, when a small and thinly-populated area is considered; thus in 1856 the male horses were as 107.1, and in 1867 as only 92.6 to 100 females. in the tabulated returns the proportions vary in cycles, for the males exceeded the females during six successive years; and the females exceeded the males during two periods each of four years; this, however, may be accidental; at least i can detect nothing of the kind with man in the decennial table in the registrar's report for 1866. dogs. during a period of twelve years, from 1857 to 1868, the births of a large number of greyhounds, throughout england, were sent to the 'field' newspaper; and i am again indebted to mr. tegetmeier for carefully tabulating the results. the recorded births were 6878, consisting of 3605 males and 3273 females, that is, in the proportion of 110.1 males to 100 females. the greatest fluctuations occurred in 1864, when the proportion was as 95.3 males, and in 1867, as 116.3 males to 100 females. the above average proportion of 110.1 to 100 is probably nearly correct in the case of the greyhound, but whether it would hold with other domesticated breeds is in some degree doubtful. mr. cupples has enquired from several great breeders of dogs, and finds that all without exception believe that females are produced in excess; but he suggests that this belief may have arisen from females being less valued, and from the consequent disappointment producing a stronger impression on the mind. sheep. the sexes of sheep are not ascertained by agriculturists until several months after birth, at the period when the males are castrated; so that the following returns do not give the proportions at birth. moreover, i find that several great breeders in scotland, who annually raise some thousand sheep, are firmly convinced that a larger proportion of males than of females die during the first year or two. therefore the proportion of males would be somewhat larger at birth than at the age of castration. this is a remarkable coincidence with what, as we have seen, occurs with mankind, and both cases probably depend on the same cause. i have received returns from four gentlemen in england who have bred lowland sheep, chiefly leicesters, during the last ten to sixteen years; they amount altogether to 8965 births, consisting of 4407 males and 4558 females; that is in the proportion of 96.7 males to 100 females. with respect to cheviot and black-faced sheep bred in scotland, i have received returns from six breeders, two of them on a large scale, chiefly for the years 1867-1869, but some of the returns extend back to 1862. the total number recorded amounts to 50,685, consisting of 25,071 males and 25,614 females or in the proportion of 97.9 males to 100 females. if we take the english and scotch returns together, the total number amounts to 59,650, consisting of 29,478 males and 30,172 females, or as 97.7 to 100. so that with sheep at the age of castration the females are certainly in excess of the males, but probably this would not hold good at birth. (59. i am much indebted to mr. cupples for having procured for me the above returns from scotland, as well as some of the following returns on cattle. mr. r. elliot, of laighwood, first called my attention to the premature deaths of the males, --a statement subsequently confirmed by mr. aitchison and others. to this latter gentleman, and to mr. payan, i owe my thanks for large returns as to sheep.) of cattle i have received returns from nine gentlemen of 982 births, too few to be trusted; these consisted of 477 bull-calves and 505 cow-calves; i.e., in the proportion of 94.4 males to 100 females. the rev. w.d. fox informs me that in 1867 out of 34 calves born on a farm in derbyshire only one was a bull. mr. harrison weir has enquired from several breeders of pigs, and most of them estimate the male to the female births as about 7 to 6. this same gentleman has bred rabbits for many years, and has noticed that a far greater number of bucks are produced than does. but estimations are of little value. of mammalia in a state of nature i have been able to learn very little. in regard to the common rat, i have received conflicting statements. mr. r. elliot, of laighwood, informs me that a rat-catcher assured him that he had always found the males in great excess, even with the young in the nest. in consequence of this, mr. elliot himself subsequently examined some hundred old ones, and found the statement true. mr. f. buckland has bred a large number of white rats, and he also believes that the males greatly exceed the females. in regard to moles, it is said that "the males are much more numerous than the females" (60. bell, 'history of british quadrupeds,' p. 100.): and as the catching of these animals is a special occupation, the statement may perhaps be trusted. sir a. smith, in describing an antelope of s. africa (61. 'illustrations of the zoology of s. africa,' 1849, pl. 29.) (kobus ellipsiprymnus), remarks, that in the herds of this and other species, the males are few in number compared with the females: the natives believe that they are born in this proportion; others believe that the younger males are expelled from the herds, and sir a. smith says, that though he has himself never seen herds consisting of young males alone, others affirm that this does occur. it appears probable that the young when expelled from the herd, would often fall a prey to the many beasts of prey of the country. birds. with respect to the fowl, i have received only one account, namely, that out of 1001 chickens of a highly-bred stock of cochins, reared during eight years by mr. stretch, 487 proved males and 514 females; i.e., as 94.7 to 100. in regard to domestic pigeons there is good evidence either that the males are produced in excess, or that they live longer; for these birds invariably pair, and single males, as mr. tegetmeier informs me, can always be purchased cheaper than females. usually the two birds reared from the two eggs laid in the same nest are a male and a female; but mr. harrison weir, who has been so large a breeder, says that he has often bred two cocks from the same nest, and seldom two hens; moreover, the hen is generally the weaker of the two, and more liable to perish. with respect to birds in a state of nature, mr. gould and others (62. brehm ('thierleben,' b. iv. s. 990) comes to the same conclusion.) are convinced that the males are generally the more numerous; and as the young males of many species resemble the females, the latter would naturally appear to be the more numerous. large numbers of pheasants are reared by mr. baker of leadenhall from eggs laid by wild birds, and he informs mr. jenner weir that four or five males to one female are generally produced. an experienced observer remarks (63. on the authority of l. lloyd, 'game birds of sweden,' 1867, pp. 12, 132.), that in scandinavia the broods of the capercailzie and black-cock contain more males than females; and that with the dal-ripa (a kind of ptarmigan) more males than females attend the leks or places of courtship; but this latter circumstance is accounted for by some observers by a greater number of hen birds being killed by vermin. from various facts given by white of selborne (64. 'nat. hist. of selborne,' letter xxix. edit. of 1825, vol. i. p. 139.), it seems clear that the males of the partridge must be in considerable excess in the south of england; and i have been assured that this is the case in scotland. mr. weir on enquiring from the dealers, who receive at certain seasons large numbers of ruffs (machetes pugnax), was told that the males are much the more numerous. this same naturalist has also enquired for me from the birdcatchers, who annually catch an astonishing number of various small species alive for the london market, and he was unhesitatingly answered by an old and trustworthy man, that with the chaffinch the males are in large excess: he thought as high as 2 males to 1 female, or at least as high as 5 to 3. (65. mr. jenner weir received similar information, on making enquiries during the following year. to shew the number of living chaffinches caught, i may mention that in 1869 there was a match between two experts, and one man caught in a day 62, and another 40, male chaffinches. the greatest number ever caught by one man in a single day was 70.) the males of the blackbird, he likewise maintained, were by far the more numerous, whether caught by traps or by netting at night. these statements may apparently be trusted, because this same man said that the sexes are about equal with the lark, the twite (linaria montana), and goldfinch. on the other hand, he is certain that with the common linnet, the females preponderate greatly, but unequally during different years; during some years he has found the females to the males as four to one. it should, however, be borne in mind, that the chief season for catching birds does not begin till september, so that with some species partial migrations may have begun, and the flocks at this period often consist of hens alone. mr. salvin paid particular attention to the sexes of the humming-birds in central america, and is convinced that with most of the species the males are in excess; thus one year he procured 204 specimens belonging to ten species, and these consisted of 166 males and of only 38 females. with two other species the females were in excess: but the proportions apparently vary either during different seasons or in different localities; for on one occasion the males of campylopterus hemileucurus were to the females as 5 to 2, and on another occasion (66. 'ibis,' vol. ii. p. 260, as quoted in gould's 'trochilidae,' 1861, p. 52. for the foregoing proportions, i am indebted to mr. salvin for a table of his results.) in exactly the reversed ratio. as bearing on this latter point, i may add, that mr. powys found in corfu and epirus the sexes of the chaffinch keeping apart, and "the females by far the most numerous"; whilst in palestine mr. tristram found "the male flocks appearing greatly to exceed the female in number." (67. 'ibis,' 1860, p. 137; and 1867, p. 369.) so again with the quiscalus major, mr. g. taylor says, that in florida there were "very few females in proportion to the males," (68. 'ibis,' 1862, p. 187.) whilst in honduras the proportion was the other way, the species there having the character of a polygamist. fish. with fish the proportional numbers of the sexes can be ascertained only by catching them in the adult or nearly adult state; and there are many difficulties in arriving at any just conclusion. (69. leuckart quotes bloch (wagner, 'handwörterbuch der phys.' b. iv. 1853, s. 775), that with fish there are twice as many males as females.) infertile females might readily be mistaken for males, as dr. gunther has remarked to me in regard to trout. with some species the males are believed to die soon after fertilising the ova. with many species the males are of much smaller size than the females, so that a large number of males would escape from the same net by which the females were caught. m. carbonnier (70. quoted in the 'farmer,' march 18, 1869, p. 369.), who has especially attended to the natural history of the pike (esox lucius), states that many males, owing to their small size, are devoured by the larger females; and he believes that the males of almost all fish are exposed from this same cause to greater danger than the females. nevertheless, in the few cases in which the proportional numbers have been actually observed, the males appear to be largely in excess. thus mr. r. buist, the superintendent of the stormontfield experiments, says that in 1865, out of 70 salmon first landed for the purpose of obtaining the ova, upwards of 60 were males. in 1867 he again "calls attention to the vast disproportion of the males to the females. we had at the outset at least ten males to one female." afterwards females sufficient for obtaining ova were procured. he adds, "from the great proportion of the males, they are constantly fighting and tearing each other on the spawning-beds." (71. 'the stormontfield piscicultural experiments,' 1866, p. 23. the 'field' newspaper, june 29, 1867.) this disproportion, no doubt, can be accounted for in part, but whether wholly is doubtful, by the males ascending the rivers before the females. mr. f. buckland remarks in regard to trout, that "it is a curious fact that the males preponderate very largely in number over the females. it invariably happens that when the first rush of fish is made to the net, there will be at least seven or eight males to one female found captive. i cannot quite account for this; either the males are more numerous than the females, or the latter seek safety by concealment rather than flight." he then adds, that by carefully searching the banks sufficient females for obtaining ova can be found. (72. 'land and water,' 1868, p. 41.) mr. h. lee informs me that out of 212 trout, taken for this purpose in lord portsmouth's park, 150 were males and 62 females. the males of the cyprinidae likewise seem to be in excess; but several members of this family, viz., the carp, tench, bream and minnow, appear regularly to follow the practice, rare in the animal kingdom, of polyandry; for the female whilst spawning is always attended by two males, one on each side, and in the case of the bream by three or four males. this fact is so well known, that it is always recommended to stock a pond with two male tenches to one female, or at least with three males to two females. with the minnow, an excellent observer states, that on the spawning-beds the males are ten times as numerous as the females; when a female comes amongst the males, "she is immediately pressed closely by a male on each side; and when they have been in that situation for a time, are superseded by other two males." (73. yarrell, 'hist. british fishes,' vol. i. 1826, p. 307; on the cyprinus carpio, p. 331; on the tinca vulgaris, p. 331; on the abramis brama, p. 336. see, for the minnow (leuciscus phoxinus), 'loudon's magazine of natural history,' vol. v. 1832, p. 682.) insects. in this great class, the lepidoptera almost alone afford means for judging of the proportional numbers of the sexes; for they have been collected with special care by many good observers, and have been largely bred from the egg or caterpillar state. i had hoped that some breeders of silk-moths might have kept an exact record, but after writing to france and italy, and consulting various treatises, i cannot find that this has ever been done. the general opinion appears to be that the sexes are nearly equal, but in italy, as i hear from professor canestrini, many breeders are convinced that the females are produced in excess. this same naturalist, however, informs me, that in the two yearly broods of the ailanthus silk-moth (bombyx cynthia), the males greatly preponderate in the first, whilst in the second the two sexes are nearly equal, or the females rather in excess. in regard to butterflies in a state of nature, several observers have been much struck by the apparently enormous preponderance of the males. (74. leuckart quotes meinecke (wagner, 'handwörterbuch der phys.' b. iv. 1853, s. 775) that the males of butterflies are three or four times as numerous as the females.) thus mr. bates (75. 'the naturalist on the amazons,' vol. ii. 1863, pp. 228, 347.), in speaking of several species, about a hundred in number, which inhabit the upper amazons, says that the males are much more numerous than the females, even in the proportion of a hundred to one. in north america, edwards, who had great experience, estimates in the genus papilio the males to the females as four to one; and mr. walsh, who informed me of this statement, says that with p. turnus this is certainly the case. in south africa, mr. r. trimen found the males in excess in 19 species (76. four of these cases are given by mr. trimen in his 'rhopalocera africae australis.'); and in one of these, which swarms in open places, he estimated the number of males as fifty to one female. with another species, in which the males are numerous in certain localities, he collected only five females during seven years. in the island of bourbon, m. maillard states that the males of one species of papilio are twenty times as numerous as the females. (77. quoted by trimen, 'transactions of the ent. society,' vol. v. part iv. 1866, p. 330.) mr. trimen informs me that as far as he has himself seen, or heard from others, it is rare for the females of any butterfly to exceed the males in number; but three south african species perhaps offer an exception. mr. wallace (78. 'transactions, linnean society,' vol. xxv. p. 37.) states that the females of ornithoptera croesus, in the malay archipelago, are more common and more easily caught than the males; but this is a rare butterfly. i may here add, that in hyperythra, a genus of moths, guenee says, that from four to five females are sent in collections from india for one male. when this subject of the proportional numbers of the sexes of insects was brought before the entomological society (79. 'proceedings, entomological society,' feb. 17, 1868.), it was generally admitted that the males of most lepidoptera, in the adult or imago state, are caught in greater numbers than the females: but this fact was attributed by various observers to the more retiring habits of the females, and to the males emerging earlier from the cocoon. this latter circumstance is well known to occur with most lepidoptera, as well as with other insects. so that, as m. personnat remarks, the males of the domesticated bombyx yamamai, are useless at the beginning of the season, and the females at the end, from the want of mates. (80. quoted by dr. wallace in 'proceedings, entomological society,' 3rd series, vol. v. 1867, p. 487.) i cannot, however, persuade myself that these causes suffice to explain the great excess of males, in the above cases of certain butterflies which are extremely common in their native countries. mr. stainton, who has paid very close attention during many years to the smaller moths, informs me that when he collected them in the imago state, he thought that the males were ten times as numerous as the females, but that since he has reared them on a large scale from the caterpillar state, he is convinced that the females are the more numerous. several entomologists concur in this view. mr. doubleday, however, and some others, take an opposite view, and are convinced that they have reared from the eggs and caterpillars a larger proportion of males than of females. besides the more active habits of the males, their earlier emergence from the cocoon, and in some cases their frequenting more open stations, other causes may be assigned for an apparent or real difference in the proportional numbers of the sexes of lepidoptera, when captured in the imago state, and when reared from the egg or caterpillar state. i hear from professor canestrini, that it is believed by many breeders in italy, that the female caterpillar of the silk-moth suffers more from the recent disease than the male; and dr. staudinger informs me that in rearing lepidoptera more females die in the cocoon than males. with many species the female caterpillar is larger than the male, and a collector would naturally choose the finest specimens, and thus unintentionally collect a larger number of females. three collectors have told me that this was their practice; but dr. wallace is sure that most collectors take all the specimens which they can find of the rarer kinds, which alone are worth the trouble of rearing. birds when surrounded by caterpillars would probably devour the largest; and professor canestrini informs me that in italy some breeders believe, though on insufficient evidence, that in the first broods of the ailanthus silk-moth, the wasps destroy a larger number of the female than of the male caterpillars. dr. wallace further remarks that female caterpillars, from being larger than the males, require more time for their development, and consume more food and moisture: and thus they would be exposed during a longer time to danger from ichneumons, birds, etc., and in times of scarcity would perish in greater numbers. hence it appears quite possible that in a state of nature, fewer female lepidoptera may reach maturity than males; and for our special object we are concerned with their relative numbers at maturity, when the sexes are ready to propagate their kind. the manner in which the males of certain moths congregate in extraordinary numbers round a single female, apparently indicates a great excess of males, though this fact may perhaps be accounted for by the earlier emergence of the males from their cocoons. mr. stainton informs me that from twelve to twenty males, may often be seen congregated round a female elachista rufocinerea. it is well known that if a virgin lasiocampa quercus or saturnia carpini be exposed in a cage, vast numbers of males collect round her, and if confined in a room will even come down the chimney to her. mr. doubleday believes that he has seen from fifty to a hundred males of both these species attracted in the course of a single day by a female in confinement. in the isle of wight mr. trimen exposed a box in which a female of the lasiocampa had been confined on the previous day, and five males soon endeavoured to gain admittance. in australia, mr. verreaux, having placed the female of a small bombyx in a box in his pocket, was followed by a crowd of males, so that about 200 entered the house with him. (81. blanchard, 'metamorphoses, moeurs des insectes,' 1868, pp. 225-226.) mr. doubleday has called my attention to m. staudinger's (82. 'lepidopteren-doubletten liste,' berlin, no. x. 1866.) list of lepidoptera, which gives the prices of the males and females of 300 species or well- marked varieties of butterflies (rhopalocera). the prices for both sexes of the very common species are of course the same; but in 114 of the rarer species they differ; the males being in all cases, excepting one, the cheaper. on an average of the prices of the 113 species, the price of the male to that of the female is as 100 to 149; and this apparently indicates that inversely the males exceed the females in the same proportion. about 2000 species or varieties of moths (heterocera) are catalogued, those with wingless females being here excluded on account of the difference in habits between the two sexes: of these 2000 species, 141 differ in price according to sex, the males of 130 being cheaper, and those of only 11 being dearer than the females. the average price of the males of the 130 species, to that of the females, is as 100 to 143. with respect to the butterflies in this priced list, mr. doubleday thinks (and no man in england has had more experience), that there is nothing in the habits of the species which can account for the difference in the prices of the two sexes, and that it can be accounted for only by an excess in the number of the males. but i am bound to add that dr. staudinger informs me, that he is himself of a different opinion. he thinks that the less active habits of the females and the earlier emergence of the males will account for his collectors securing a larger number of males than of females, and consequently for the lower prices of the former. with respect to specimens reared from the caterpillar-state, dr. staudinger believes, as previously stated, that a greater number of females than of males die whilst confined to the cocoons. he adds that with certain species one sex seems to preponderate over the other during certain years. of direct observations on the sexes of lepidoptera, reared either from eggs or caterpillars, i have received only the few following cases: (see following table.) so that in these eight lots of cocoons and eggs, males were produced in excess. taken together the proportion of males is as 122.7 to 100 females. but the numbers are hardly large enough to be trustworthy. on the whole, from these various sources of evidence, all pointing in the same direction, i infer that with most species of lepidoptera, the mature males generally exceed the females in number, whatever the proportions may be at their first emergence from the egg. males females the rev. j. hellins* of exeter reared, during 1868, imagos of 73 species, which consisted of 153 137 mr. albert jones of eltham reared, during 1868, imagos of 9 species, which consisted of 159 126 during 1869 he reared imagos from 4 species consisting of 114 112 mr. buckler of emsworth, hants, during 1869, reared imagos from 74 species, consisting of 180 169 dr. wallace of colchester reared from one brood of bombyx cynthia 52 48 dr. wallace raised, from cocoons of bombyx pernyi sent from china, during 1869 224 123 dr. wallace raised, during 1868 and 1869, from two lots of cocoons of bombyx yamamai 52 46 total 934 761 (*83. this naturalist has been so kind as to send me some results from former years, in which the females seemed to preponderate; but so many of the figures were estimates, that i found it impossible to tabulate them.) with reference to the other orders of insects, i have been able to collect very little reliable information. with the stag-beetle (lucanus cervus) "the males appear to be much more numerous than the females"; but when, as cornelius remarked during 1867, an unusual number of these beetles appeared in one part of germany, the females appeared to exceed the males as six to one. with one of the elateridae, the males are said to be much more numerous than the females, and "two or three are often found united with one female (84. gunther's 'record of zoological literature,' 1867, p. 260. on the excess of female lucanus, ibid, p. 250. on the males of lucanus in england, westwood,' 'modern classification of insects,' vol. i. p. 187. on the siagonium, ibid. p. 172.); so that here polyandry seems to prevail." with siagonium (staphylinidae), in which the males are furnished with horns, "the females are far more numerous than the opposite sex." mr. janson stated at the entomological society that the females of the bark feeding tomicus villosus are so common as to be a plague, whilst the males are so rare as to be hardly known. it is hardly worth while saying anything about the proportion of the sexes in certain species and even groups of insects, for the males are unknown or very rare, and the females are parthenogenetic, that is, fertile without sexual union; examples of this are afforded by several of the cynipidae. (85. walsh in 'the american entomologist,' vol. i. 1869, p. 103. f. smith, 'record of zoological lit.' 1867, p. 328.) in all the gall-making cynipidae known to mr. walsh, the females are four or five times as numerous as the males; and so it is, as he informs me, with the gall-making cecidomyiidae (diptera). with some common species of saw-flies (tenthredinae) mr. f. smith has reared hundreds of specimens from larvae of all sizes, but has never reared a single male; on the other hand, curtis says (86. 'farm insects,' pp. 45-46.), that with certain species (athalia), bred by him, the males were to the females as six to one; whilst exactly the reverse occurred with the mature insects of the same species caught in the fields. in the family of bees, hermann müller (87. 'anwendung der darwin'schen lehre,' verh. d. n. jahrg., xxiv.), collected a large number of specimens of many species, and reared others from the cocoons, and counted the sexes. he found that the males of some species greatly exceeded the females in number; in others the reverse occurred; and in others the two sexes were nearly equal. but as in most cases the males emerge from the cocoons before the females, they are at the commencement of the breeding-season practically in excess. müller also observed that the relative number of the two sexes in some species differed much in different localities. but as h. müller has himself remarked to me, these remarks must be received with some caution, as one sex might more easily escape observation than the other. thus his brother fritz müller has noticed in brazil that the two sexes of the same species of bee sometimes frequent different kinds of flowers. with respect to the orthoptera, i know hardly anything about the relative number of the sexes: korte (88. 'die strich, zug oder wanderheuschrecke,' 1828, p. 20.), however, says that out of 500 locusts which he examined, the males were to the females as five to six. with the neuroptera, mr. walsh states that in many, but by no means in all the species of the odonatous group, there is a great overplus of males: in the genus hetaerina, also, the males are generally at least four times as numerous as the females. in certain species in the genus gomphus the males are equally in excess, whilst in two other species, the females are twice or thrice as numerous as the males. in some european species of psocus thousands of females may be collected without a single male, whilst with other species of the same genus both sexes are common. (89. 'observations on n. american neuroptera,' by h. hagen and b.d. walsh, 'proceedings, ent. soc. philadelphia,' oct. 1863, pp. 168, 223, 239.) in england, mr. maclachlan has captured hundreds of the female apatania muliebris, but has never seen the male; and of boreus hyemalis only four or five males have been seen here. (90. 'proceedings, ent. soc. london,' feb. 17, 1868.) with most of these species (excepting the tenthredinae) there is at present no evidence that the females are subject to parthenogenesis; and thus we see how ignorant we are of the causes of the apparent discrepancy in the proportion of the two sexes. in the other classes of the articulata i have been able to collect still less information. with spiders, mr. blackwall, who has carefully attended to this class during many years, writes to me that the males from their more erratic habits are more commonly seen, and therefore appear more numerous. this is actually the case with a few species; but he mentions several species in six genera, in which the females appear to be much more numerous than the males. (91. another great authority with respect to this class, prof. thorell of upsala ('on european spiders,' 1869-70, part i. p. 205), speaks as if female spiders were generally commoner than the males.) the small size of the males in comparison with the females (a peculiarity which is sometimes carried to an extreme degree), and their widely different appearance, may account in some instances for their rarity in collections. (92. see, on this subject, mr. o.p. cambridge, as quoted in 'quarterly journal of science,' 1868, page 429.) some of the lower crustaceans are able to propagate their kind sexually, and this will account for the extreme rarity of the males; thus von siebold (93. 'beiträge zur parthenogenesis,' p. 174.) carefully examined no less than 13,000 specimens of apus from twenty-one localities, and amongst these he found only 319 males. with some other forms (as tanais and cypris), as fritz müller informs me, there is reason to believe that the males are much shorter-lived than the females; and this would explain their scarcity, supposing the two sexes to be at first equal in number. on the other hand, müller has invariably taken far more males than females of the diastylidae and of cypridina on the shores of brazil: thus with a species in the latter genus, 63 specimens caught the same day included 57 males; but he suggests that this preponderance may be due to some unknown difference in the habits of the two sexes. with one of the higher brazilian crabs, namely a gelasimus, fritz müller found the males to be more numerous than the females. according to the large experience of mr. c. spence bate, the reverse seems to be the case with six common british crabs, the names of which he has given me. the proportion of the sexes in relation to natural selection. there is reason to suspect that in some cases man has by selection indirectly influenced his own sex-producing powers. certain women tend to produce during their whole lives more children of one sex than of the other: and the same holds good of many animals, for instance, cows and horses; thus mr. wright of yeldersley house informs me that one of his arab mares, though put seven times to different horses, produced seven fillies. though i have very little evidence on this head, analogy would lead to the belief, that the tendency to produce either sex would be inherited like almost every other peculiarity, for instance, that of producing twins; and concerning the above tendency a good authority, mr. j. downing, has communicated to me facts which seem to prove that this does occur in certain families of short-horn cattle. col. marshall (94. 'the todas,' 1873, pp. 100, 111, 194, 196.) has recently found on careful examination that the todas, a hill-tribe of india, consist of 112 males and 84 females of all ages--that is in a ratio of 133.3 males to 100 females. the todas, who are polyandrous in their marriages, during former times invariably practised female infanticide; but this practice has now been discontinued for a considerable period. of the children born within late years, the males are more numerous than the females, in the proportion of 124 to 100. colonel marshall accounts for this fact in the following ingenious manner. "let us for the purpose of illustration take three families as representing an average of the entire tribe; say that one mother gives birth to six daughters and no sons; a second mother has six sons only, whilst the third mother has three sons and three daughters. the first mother, following the tribal custom, destroys four daughters and preserves two. the second retains her six sons. the third kills two daughters and keeps one, as also her three sons. we have then from the three families, nine sons and three daughters, with which to continue the breed. but whilst the males belong to families in which the tendency to produce sons is great, the females are of those of a converse inclination. thus the bias strengthens with each generation, until, as we find, families grow to have habitually more sons than daughters." that this result would follow from the above form of infanticide seems almost certain; that is if we assume that a sex-producing tendency is inherited. but as the above numbers are so extremely scanty, i have searched for additional evidence, but cannot decide whether what i have found is trustworthy; nevertheless the facts are, perhaps, worth giving. the maories of new zealand have long practised infanticide; and mr. fenton (95. 'aboriginal inhabitants of new zealand: government report,' 1859, p. 36.) states that he "has met with instances of women who have destroyed four, six, and even seven children, mostly females. however, the universal testimony of those best qualified to judge, is conclusive that this custom has for many years been almost extinct. probably the year 1835 may be named as the period of its ceasing to exist." now amongst the new zealanders, as with the todas, male births are considerably in excess. mr. fenton remarks (p. 30), "one fact is certain, although the exact period of the commencement of this singular condition of the disproportion of the sexes cannot be demonstratively fixed, it is quite clear that this course of decrease was in full operation during the years 1830 to 1844, when the non-adult population of 1844 was being produced, and has continued with great energy up to the present time." the following statements are taken from mr. fenton (p. 26), but as the numbers are not large, and as the census was not accurate, uniform results cannot be expected. it should be borne in mind in this and the following cases, that the normal state of every population is an excess of women, at least in all civilised countries, chiefly owing to the greater mortality of the male sex during youth, and partly to accidents of all kinds later in life. in 1858, the native population of new zealand was estimated as consisting of 31,667 males and 24,303 females of all ages, that is in the ratio of 130.3 males to 100 females. but during this same year, and in certain limited districts, the numbers were ascertained with much care, and the males of all ages were here 753 and the females 616; that is in the ratio of 122.2 males to 100 females. it is more important for us that during this same year of 1858, the non-adult males within the same district were found to be 178, and the non-adult females 142, that is in the ratio of 125.3 to 100. it may be added that in 1844, at which period female infanticide had only lately ceased, the non-adult males in one district were 281, and the non- adult females only 194, that is in the ratio of 144.8 males to 100 females. in the sandwich islands, the males exceed the females in number. infanticide was formerly practised there to a frightful extent, but was by no means confined to female infants, as is shewn by mr. ellis (96. 'narrative of a tour through hawaii,' 1826, p. 298.), and as i have been informed by bishop staley and the rev. mr. coan. nevertheless, another apparently trustworthy writer, mr. jarves (97. 'history of the sandwich islands,' 1843, p. 93.), whose observations apply to the whole archipelago, remarks:--"numbers of women are to be found, who confess to the murder of from three to six or eight children," and he adds, "females from being considered less useful than males were more often destroyed." from what is known to occur in other parts of the world, this statement is probable; but must be received with much caution. the practice of infanticide ceased about the year 1819, when idolatry was abolished and missionaries settled in the islands. a careful census in 1839 of the adult and taxable men and women in the island of kauai and in one district of oahu (jarves, p. 404), gives 4723 males and 3776 females; that is in the ratio of 125.08 to 100. at the same time the number of males under fourteen years in kauai and under eighteen in oahu was 1797, and of females of the same ages 1429; and here we have the ratio of 125.75 males to 100 females. in a census of all the islands in 1850 (98. this is given in the rev. h.t. cheever's 'life in the sandwich islands,' 1851, p. 277.), the males of all ages amount to 36,272, and the females to 33,128, or as 109.49 to 100. the males under seventeen years amounted to 10,773, and the females under the same age to 9593, or as 112.3 to 100. from the census of 1872, the proportion of males of all ages (including half-castes) to females, is as 125.36 to 100. it must be borne in mind that all these returns for the sandwich islands give the proportion of living males to living females, and not of the births; and judging from all civilised countries the proportion of males would have been considerably higher if the numbers had referred to births. (99. dr. coulter, in describing ('journal r. geograph. soc.' vol. v. 1835, p. 67) the state of california about the year 1830, says that the natives, reclaimed by the spanish missionaries, have nearly all perished, or are perishing, although well treated, not driven from their native land, and kept from the use of spirits. he attributes this, in great part, to the undoubted fact that the men greatly exceed the women in number; but he does not know whether this is due to a failure of female offspring, or to more females dying during early youth. the latter alternative, according to all analogy, is very improbable. he adds that "infanticide, properly so called, is not common, though very frequent recourse is had to abortion." if dr. coulter is correct about infanticide, this case cannot be advanced in support of colonel marshall's view. from the rapid decrease of the reclaimed natives, we may suspect that, as in the cases lately given, their fertility has been diminished from changed habits of life. i had hoped to gain some light on this subject from the breeding of dogs; inasmuch as in most breeds, with the exception, perhaps, of greyhounds, many more female puppies are destroyed than males, just as with the toda infants. mr. cupples assures me that this is usual with scotch deer- hounds. unfortunately, i know nothing of the proportion of the sexes in any breed, excepting greyhounds, and there the male births are to the females as 110.1 to 100. now from enquiries made from many breeders, it seems that the females are in some respects more esteemed, though otherwise troublesome; and it does not appear that the female puppies of the best- bred dogs are systematically destroyed more than the males, though this does sometimes take place to a limited extent. therefore i am unable to decide whether we can, on the above principles, account for the preponderance of male births in greyhounds. on the other hand, we have seen that with horses, cattle, and sheep, which are too valuable for the young of either sex to be destroyed, if there is any difference, the females are slightly in excess.) from the several foregoing cases we have some reason to believe that infanticide practised in the manner above explained, tends to make a male- producing race; but i am far from supposing that this practice in the case of man, or some analogous process with other species, has been the sole determining cause of an excess of males. there may be some unknown law leading to this result in decreasing races, which have already become somewhat infertile. besides the several causes previously alluded to, the greater facility of parturition amongst savages, and the less consequent injury to their male infants, would tend to increase the proportion of live-born males to females. there does not, however, seem to be any necessary connection between savage life and a marked excess of males; that is if we may judge by the character of the scanty offspring of the lately existing tasmanians and of the crossed offspring of the tahitians now inhabiting norfolk island. as the males and females of many animals differ somewhat in habits and are exposed in different degrees to danger, it is probable that in many cases, more of one sex than of the other are habitually destroyed. but as far as i can trace out the complication of causes, an indiscriminate though large destruction of either sex would not tend to modify the sex-producing power of the species. with strictly social animals, such as bees or ants, which produce a vast number of sterile and fertile females in comparison with the males, and to whom this preponderance is of paramount importance, we can see that those communities would flourish best which contained females having a strong inherited tendency to produce more and more females; and in such cases an unequal sex-producing tendency would be ultimately gained through natural selection. with animals living in herds or troops, in which the males come to the front and defend the herd, as with the bisons of north america and certain baboons, it is conceivable that a male- producing tendency might be gained by natural selection; for the individuals of the better defended herds would leave more numerous descendants. in the case of mankind the advantage arising from having a preponderance of men in the tribe is supposed to be one chief cause of the practice of female infanticide. in no case, as far as we can see, would an inherited tendency to produce both sexes in equal numbers or to produce one sex in excess, be a direct advantage or disadvantage to certain individuals more than to others; for instance, an individual with a tendency to produce more males than females would not succeed better in the battle for life than an individual with an opposite tendency; and therefore a tendency of this kind could not be gained through natural selection. nevertheless, there are certain animals (for instance, fishes and cirripedes) in which two or more males appear to be necessary for the fertilisation of the female; and the males accordingly largely preponderate, but it is by no means obvious how this male-producing tendency could have been acquired. i formerly thought that when a tendency to produce the two sexes in equal numbers was advantageous to the species, it would follow from natural selection, but i now see that the whole problem is so intricate that it is safer to leave its solution for the future. chapter ix. secondary sexual characters in the lower classes of the animal kingdom. these characters absent in the lowest classes--brilliant colours--mollusca --annelids--crustacea, secondary sexual characters strongly developed; dimorphism; colour; characters not acquired before maturity--spiders, sexual colours of; stridulation by the males--myriapoda. with animals belonging to the lower classes, the two sexes are not rarely united in the same individual, and therefore secondary sexual characters cannot be developed. in many cases where the sexes are separate, both are permanently attached to some support, and the one cannot search or struggle for the other. moreover it is almost certain that these animals have too imperfect senses and much too low mental powers to appreciate each other's beauty or other attractions, or to feel rivalry. hence in these classes or sub-kingdoms, such as the protozoa, coelenterata, echinodermata, scolecida, secondary sexual characters, of the kind which we have to consider, do not occur: and this fact agrees with the belief that such characters in the higher classes have been acquired through sexual selection, which depends on the will, desire, and choice of either sex. nevertheless some few apparent exceptions occur; thus, as i hear from dr. baird, the males of certain entozoa, or internal parasitic worms, differ slightly in colour from the females; but we have no reason to suppose that such differences have been augmented through sexual selection. contrivances by which the male holds the female, and which are indispensable for the propagation of the species, are independent of sexual selection, and have been acquired through ordinary selection. many of the lower animals, whether hermaphrodites or with separate sexes, are ornamented with the most brilliant tints, or are shaded and striped in an elegant manner; for instance, many corals and sea-anemones (actiniae), some jelly-fish (medusae, porpita, etc.), some planariae, many star-fishes, echini, ascidians, etc.; but we may conclude from the reasons already indicated, namely, the union of the two sexes in some of these animals, the permanently affixed condition of others, and the low mental powers of all, that such colours do not serve as a sexual attraction, and have not been acquired through sexual selection. it should be borne in mind that in no case have we sufficient evidence that colours have been thus acquired, except where one sex is much more brilliantly or conspicuously coloured than the other, and where there is no difference in habits between the sexes sufficient to account for their different colours. but the evidence is rendered as complete as it can ever be, only when the more ornamented individuals, almost always the males, voluntarily display their attractions before the other sex; for we cannot believe that such display is useless, and if it be advantageous, sexual selection will almost inevitably follow. we may, however, extend this conclusion to both sexes, when coloured alike, if their colours are plainly analogous to those of one sex alone in certain other species of the same group. how, then, are we to account for the beautiful or even gorgeous colours of many animals in the lowest classes? it appears doubtful whether such colours often serve as a protection; but that we may easily err on this head, will be admitted by every one who reads mr. wallace's excellent essay on this subject. it would not, for instance, at first occur to any one that the transparency of the medusae, or jelly-fish, is of the highest service to them as a protection; but when we are reminded by haeckel that not only the medusae, but many floating mollusca, crustaceans, and even small oceanic fishes partake of this same glass-like appearance, often accompanied by prismatic colours, we can hardly doubt that they thus escape the notice of pelagic birds and other enemies. m. giard is also convinced (1. 'archives de zoolog. exper.' oct. 1872, p. 563.) that the bright tints of certain sponges and ascidians serve as a protection. conspicuous colours are likewise beneficial to many animals as a warning to their would-be devourers that they are distasteful, or that they possess some special means of defence; but this subject will be discussed more conveniently hereafter. we can, in our ignorance of most of the lowest animals, only say that their bright tints result either from the chemical nature or the minute structure of their tissues, independently of any benefit thus derived. hardly any colour is finer than that of arterial blood; but there is no reason to suppose that the colour of the blood is in itself any advantage; and though it adds to the beauty of the maiden's cheek, no one will pretend that it has been acquired for this purpose. so again with many animals, especially the lower ones, the bile is richly coloured; thus, as i am informed by mr. hancock, the extreme beauty of the eolidae (naked sea-slugs) is chiefly due to the biliary glands being seen through the translucent integuments--this beauty being probably of no service to these animals. the tints of the decaying leaves in an american forest are described by every one as gorgeous; yet no one supposes that these tints are of the least advantage to the trees. bearing in mind how many substances closely analogous to natural organic compounds have been recently formed by chemists, and which exhibit the most splendid colours, it would have been a strange fact if substances similarly coloured had not often originated, independently of any useful end thus gained, in the complex laboratory of living organisms. the sub-kingdom of the mollusca. throughout this great division of the animal kingdom, as far as i can discover, secondary sexual characters, such as we are here considering, never occur. nor could they be expected in the three lowest classes, namely, in the ascidians, polyzoa, and brachiopods (constituting the molluscoida of some authors), for most of these animals are permanently affixed to a support or have their sexes united in the same individual. in the lamellibranchiata, or bivalve shells, hermaphroditism is not rare. in the next higher class of the gasteropoda, or univalve shells, the sexes are either united or separate. but in the latter case the males never possess special organs for finding, securing, or charming the females, or for fighting with other males. as i am informed by mr. gwyn jeffreys, the sole external difference between the sexes consists in the shell sometimes differing a little in form; for instance, the shell of the male periwinkle (littorina littorea) is narrower and has a more elongated spire than that of the female. but differences of this nature, it may be presumed, are directly connected with the act of reproduction, or with the development of the ova. the gasteropoda, though capable of locomotion and furnished with imperfect eyes, do not appear to be endowed with sufficient mental powers for the members of the same sex to struggle together in rivalry, and thus to acquire secondary sexual characters. nevertheless with the pulmoniferous gasteropods, or land-snails, the pairing is preceded by courtship; for these animals, though hermaphrodites, are compelled by their structure to pair together. agassiz remarks, "quiconque a eu l'occasion d'observer les amours des limaçons, ne saurait mettre en doute la séduction deployée dans les mouvements et les allures qui préparent et accomplissent le double embrassement de ces hermaphrodites." (2. 'de l'espèce et de la class.' etc., 1869, p. 106.) these animals appear also susceptible of some degree of permanent attachment: an accurate observer, mr. lonsdale, informs me that he placed a pair of land-snails, (helix pomatia), one of which was weakly, into a small and ill-provided garden. after a short time the strong and healthy individual disappeared, and was traced by its track of slime over a wall into an adjoining well-stocked garden. mr. lonsdale concluded that it had deserted its sickly mate; but after an absence of twenty-four hours it returned, and apparently communicated the result of its successful exploration, for both then started along the same track and disappeared over the wall. even in the highest class of the mollusca, the cephalopoda or cuttle- fishes, in which the sexes are separate, secondary sexual characters of the present kind do not, as far as i can discover, occur. this is a surprising circumstance, as these animals possess highly-developed sense-organs and have considerable mental powers, as will be admitted by every one who has watched their artful endeavours to escape from an enemy. (3. see, for instance, the account which i have given in my 'journal of researches,' 1845, p. 7.) certain cephalopoda, however, are characterised by one extraordinary sexual character, namely that the male element collects within one of the arms or tentacles, which is then cast off, and clinging by its sucking-discs to the female, lives for a time an independent life. so completely does the cast-off arm resemble a separate animal, that it was described by cuvier as a parasitic worm under the name of hectocotyle. but this marvellous structure may be classed as a primary rather than as a secondary sexual character. although with the mollusca sexual selection does not seem to have come into play; yet many univalve and bivalve shells, such as volutes, cones, scallops, etc., are beautifully coloured and shaped. the colours do not appear in most cases to be of any use as a protection; they are probably the direct result, as in the lowest classes, of the nature of the tissues; the patterns and the sculpture of the shell depending on its manner of growth. the amount of light seems to be influential to a certain extent; for although, as repeatedly stated by mr. gwyn jeffreys, the shells of some species living at a profound depth are brightly coloured, yet we generally see the lower surfaces, as well as the parts covered by the mantle, less highly-coloured than the upper and exposed surfaces. (4. i have given ('geological observations on volcanic islands,' 1844, p. 53) a curious instance of the influence of light on the colours of a frondescent incrustation, deposited by the surf on the coast-rocks of ascension and formed by the solution of triturated sea-shells.) in some cases, as with shells living amongst corals or brightly-tinted seaweeds, the bright colours may serve as a protection. (5. dr. morse has lately discussed this subject in his paper on the 'adaptive coloration of mollusca,' 'proc. boston soc. of nat. hist.' vol. xiv. april 1871.) but that many of the nudibranch mollusca, or sea-slugs, are as beautifully coloured as any shells, may be seen in messrs. alder and hancock's magnificent work; and from information kindly given me by mr. hancock, it seems extremely doubtful whether these colours usually serve as a protection. with some species this may be the case, as with one kind which lives on the green leaves of algae, and is itself bright-green. but many brightly-coloured, white, or otherwise conspicuous species, do not seek concealment; whilst again some equally conspicuous species, as well as other dull-coloured kinds live under stones and in dark recesses. so that with these nudibranch molluscs, colour apparently does not stand in any close relation to the nature of the places which they inhabit. these naked sea-slugs are hermaphrodites, yet they pair together, as do land-snails, many of which have extremely pretty shells. it is conceivable that two hermaphrodites, attracted by each other's greater beauty, might unite and leave offspring which would inherit their parents' greater beauty. but with such lowly-organised creatures this is extremely improbable. nor is it at all obvious how the offspring from the more beautiful pairs of hermaphrodites would have any advantage over the offspring of the less beautiful, so as to increase in number, unless indeed vigour and beauty generally coincided. we have not here the case of a number of males becoming mature before the females, with the more beautiful males selected by the more vigorous females. if, indeed, brilliant colours were beneficial to a hermaphrodite animal in relation to its general habits of life, the more brightly-tinted individuals would succeed best and would increase in number; but this would be a case of natural and not of sexual selection. sub-kingdom of the vermes: class, annelida (or sea-worms). in this class, although the sexes, when separate, sometimes differ from each other in characters of such importance that they have been placed under distinct genera or even families, yet the differences do not seem of the kind which can be safely attributed to sexual selection. these animals are often beautifully coloured, but as the sexes do not differ in this respect, we are but little concerned with them. even the nemertians, though so lowly organised, "vie in beauty and variety of colouring with any other group in the invertebrate series"; yet dr. mcintosh (6. see his beautiful monograph on 'british annelids,' part i. 1873, p. 3.) cannot discover that these colours are of any service. the sedentary annelids become duller-coloured, according to m. quatrefages (7. see m. perrier: 'l'origine de l'homme d'après darwin,' 'revue scientifique', feb. 1873, p. 866.), after the period of reproduction; and this i presume may be attributed to their less vigorous condition at that time. all these worm- like animals apparently stand too low in the scale for the individuals of either sex to exert any choice in selecting a partner, or for the individuals of the same sex to struggle together in rivalry. sub-kingdom of the arthropoda: class, crustacea. in this great class we first meet with undoubted secondary sexual characters, often developed in a remarkable manner. unfortunately the habits of crustaceans are very imperfectly known, and we cannot explain the uses of many structures peculiar to one sex. with the lower parasitic species the males are of small size, and they alone are furnished with perfect swimming-legs, antennae and sense-organs; the females being destitute of these organs, with their bodies often consisting of a mere distorted mass. but these extraordinary differences between the two sexes are no doubt related to their widely different habits of life, and consequently do not concern us. in various crustaceans, belonging to distinct families, the anterior antennae are furnished with peculiar thread-like bodies, which are believed to act as smelling-organs, and these are much more numerous in the males than in the females. as the males, without any unusual development of their olfactory organs, would almost certainly be able sooner or later to find the females, the increased number of the smelling-threads has probably been acquired through sexual selection, by the better provided males having been the more successful in finding partners and in producing offspring. fritz müller has described a remarkable dimorphic species of tanais, in which the male is represented by two distinct forms, which never graduate into each other. in the one form the male is furnished with more numerous smelling-threads, and in the other form with more powerful and more elongated chelae or pincers, which serve to hold the female. fritz müller suggests that these differences between the two male forms of the same species may have originated in certain individuals having varied in the number of the smelling-threads, whilst other individuals varied in the shape and size of their chelae; so that of the former, those which were best able to find the female, and of the latter, those which were best able to hold her, have left the greatest number of progeny to inherit their respective advantages. (8. 'facts and arguments for darwin,' english translat., 1869, p. 20. see the previous discussion on the olfactory threads. sars has described a somewhat analogous case (as quoted in 'nature,' 1870, p. 455) in a norwegian crustacean, the pontoporeia affinis.) [fig.4. labidocera darwinii (from lubbock). labelled are: a. part of right anterior antenna of male, forming a prehensile organ. b. posterior pair of thoracic legs of male. c. ditto of female.] in some of the lower crustaceans, the right anterior antenna of the male differs greatly in structure from the left, the latter resembling in its simple tapering joints the antennae of the female. in the male the modified antenna is either swollen in the middle or angularly bent, or converted (fig. 4) into an elegant, and sometimes wonderfully complex, prehensile organ. (9. see sir j. lubbock in 'annals and mag. of nat. hist.' vol. xi. 1853, pl. i. and x.; and vol. xii. (1853), pl. vii. see also lubbock in 'transactions, entomological society,' vol. iv. new series, 1856-1858, p. 8. with respect to the zigzagged antennae mentioned below, see fritz müller, 'facts and arguments for darwin,' 1869, p. 40, foot- note.) it serves, as i hear from sir j. lubbock, to hold the female, and for this same purpose one of the two posterior legs (b) on the same side of the body is converted into a forceps. in another family the inferior or posterior antennae are "curiously zigzagged" in the males alone. [fig. 5. anterior part of body of callianassa (from milne-edwards), showing the unequal and differently-constructed right and left-hand chelae of the male. n.b.--the artist by mistake has reversed the drawing, and made the left-hand chela the largest. fig. 6. second leg of male orchestia tucuratinga (from fritz müller). fig. 7. ditto of female.] in the higher crustaceans the anterior legs are developed into chelae or pincers; and these are generally larger in the male than in the female,--so much so that the market value of the male edible crab (cancer pagurus), according to mr. c. spence bate, is five times as great as that of the female. in many species the chelae are of unequal size on the opposite side of the body, the right-hand one being, as i am informed by mr. bate, generally, though not invariably, the largest. this inequality is also often much greater in the male than in the female. the two chelae of the male often differ in structure (figs. 5, 6, and 7), the smaller one resembling that of the female. what advantage is gained by their inequality in size on the opposite sides of the body, and by the inequality being much greater in the male than in the female; and why, when they are of equal size, both are often much larger in the male than in the female, is not known. as i hear from mr. bate, the chelae are sometimes of such length and size that they cannot possibly be used for carrying food to the mouth. in the males of certain fresh-water prawns (palaemon) the right leg is actually longer than the whole body. (10. see a paper by mr. c. spence bate, with figures, in 'proceedings, zoological society,' 1868, p. 363; and on the nomenclature of the genus, ibid. p. 585. i am greatly indebted to mr. spence bate for nearly all the above statements with respect to the chelae of the higher crustaceans.) the great size of the one leg with its chelae may aid the male in fighting with his rivals; but this will not account for their inequality in the female on the opposite sides of the body. in gelasimus, according to a statement quoted by milne edwards (11. 'hist. nat. des crust.' tom. ii. 1837, p. 50.), the male and the female live in the same burrow, and this shews that they pair; the male closes the mouth of the burrow with one of its chelae, which is enormously developed; so that here it indirectly serves as a means of defence. their main use, however, is probably to seize and to secure the female, and this in some instances, as with gammarus, is known to be the case. the male of the hermit or soldier crab (pagurus) for weeks together, carries about the shell inhabited by the female. (12. mr. c. spence bate, 'british association, fourth report on the fauna of s. devon.') the sexes, however, of the common shore-crab (carcinus maenas), as mr. bate informs me, unite directly after the female has moulted her hard shell, when she is so soft that she would be injured if seized by the strong pincers of the male; but as she is caught and carried about by the male before moulting, she could then be seized with impunity. [fig.8. orchestia darwinii (from fritz müller), showing the differently- constructed chelae of the two male forms.] fritz müller states that certain species of melita are distinguished from all other amphipods by the females having "the coxal lamellae of the penultimate pair of feet produced into hook-like processes, of which the males lay hold with the hands of the first pair." the development of these hook-like processes has probably followed from those females which were the most securely held during the act of reproduction, having left the largest number of offspring. another brazilian amphipod (see orchestia darwinii, fig. 8) presents a case of dimorphism, like that of tanais; for there are two male forms, which differ in the structure of their chelae. (13. fritz müller, 'facts and arguments for darwin,' 1869, pp. 25-28.) as either chela would certainly suffice to hold the female,--for both are now used for this purpose,--the two male forms probably originated by some having varied in one manner and some in another; both forms having derived certain special, but nearly equal advantages, from their differently shaped organs. it is not known that male crustaceans fight together for the possession of the females, but it is probably the case; for with most animals when the male is larger than the female, he seems to owe his greater size to his ancestors having fought with other males during many generations. in most of the orders, especially in the highest or the brachyura, the male is larger than the female; the parasitic genera, however, in which the sexes follow different habits of life, and most of the entomostraca must be excepted. the chelae of many crustaceans are weapons well adapted for fighting. thus when a devil-crab (portunus puber) was seen by a son of mr. bate fighting with a carcinus maenas, the latter was soon thrown on its back, and had every limb torn from its body. when several males of a brazilian gelasimus, a species furnished with immense pincers, were placed together in a glass vessel by fritz müller, they mutilated and killed one another. mr. bate put a large male carcinus maenas into a pan of water, inhabited by a female which was paired with a smaller male; but the latter was soon dispossessed. mr. bate adds, "if they fought, the victory was a bloodless one, for i saw no wounds." this same naturalist separated a male sand-skipper (so common on our sea-shores), gammarus marinus, from its female, both of whom were imprisoned in the same vessel with many individuals of the same species. the female, when thus divorced, soon joined the others. after a time the male was put again into the same vessel; and he then, after swimming about for a time, dashed into the crowd, and without any fighting at once took away his wife. this fact shews that in the amphipoda, an order low in the scale, the males and females recognise each other, and are mutually attached. the mental powers of the crustacea are probably higher than at first sight appears probable. any one who tries to catch one of the shore-crabs, so common on tropical coasts, will perceive how wary and alert they are. there is a large crab (birgus latro), found on coral islands, which makes a thick bed of the picked fibres of the cocoa-nut, at the bottom of a deep burrow. it feeds on the fallen fruit of this tree by tearing off the husk, fibre by fibre; and it always begins at that end where the three eye-like depressions are situated. it then breaks through one of these eyes by hammering with its heavy front pincers, and turning round, extracts the albuminous core with its narrow posterior pincers. but these actions are probably instinctive, so that they would be performed as well by a young animal as by an old one. the following case, however, can hardly be so considered: a trustworthy naturalist, mr. gardner (14. 'travels in the interior of brazil,' 1846, p. 111. i have given, in my 'journal of researches,' p. 463, an account of the habits of the birgus.), whilst watching a shore-crab (gelasimus) making its burrow, threw some shells towards the hole. one rolled in, and three other shells remained within a few inches of the mouth. in about five minutes the crab brought out the shell which had fallen in, and carried it away to a distance of a foot; it then saw the three other shells lying near, and evidently thinking that they might likewise roll in, carried them to the spot where it had laid the first. it would, i think, be difficult to distinguish this act from one performed by man by the aid of reason. mr. bate does not know of any well-marked case of difference of colour in the two sexes of our british crustaceans, in which respect the sexes of the higher animals so often differ. in some cases, however, the males and females differ slightly in tint, but mr. bate thinks not more than may be accounted for by their different habits of life, such as by the male wandering more about, and being thus more exposed to the light. dr. power tried to distinguish by colour the sexes of the several species which inhabit the mauritius, but failed, except with one species of squilla, probably s. stylifera, the male of which is described as being "of a beautiful bluish-green," with some of the appendages cherry-red, whilst the female is clouded with brown and grey, "with the red about her much less vivid than in the male." (15. mr. ch. fraser, in 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1869, p. 3. i am indebted to mr. bate for dr. power's statement.) in this case, we may suspect the agency of sexual selection. from m. bert's observations on daphnia, when placed in a vessel illuminated by a prism, we have reason to believe that even the lowest crustaceans can distinguish colours. with saphirina (an oceanic genus of entomostraca), the males are furnished with minute shields or cell-like bodies, which exhibit beautiful changing colours; these are absent in the females, and in both sexes of one species. (16. claus, 'die freilebenden copepoden,' 1863, s. 35.) it would, however, be extremely rash to conclude that these curious organs serve to attract the females. i am informed by fritz müller, that in the female of a brazilian species of gelasimus, the whole body is of a nearly uniform greyish-brown. in the male the posterior part of the cephalo- thorax is pure white, with the anterior part of a rich green, shading into dark brown; and it is remarkable that these colours are liable to change in the course of a few minutes--the white becoming dirty grey or even black, the green "losing much of its brilliancy." it deserves especial notice that the males do not acquire their bright colours until they become mature. they appear to be much more numerous than the females; they differ also in the larger size of their chelae. in some species of the genus, probably in all, the sexes pair and inhabit the same burrow. they are also, as we have seen, highly intelligent animals. from these various considerations it seems probable that the male in this species has become gaily ornamented in order to attract or excite the female. it has just been stated that the male gelasimus does not acquire his conspicuous colours until mature and nearly ready to breed. this seems a general rule in the whole class in respect to the many remarkable structural differences between the sexes. we shall hereafter find the same law prevailing throughout the great sub-kingdom of the vertebrata; and in all cases it is eminently distinctive of characters which have been acquired through sexual selection. fritz müller (17. 'facts and arguments,' etc., p. 79.) gives some striking instances of this law; thus the male sand-hopper (orchestia) does not, until nearly full grown, acquire his large claspers, which are very differently constructed from those of the female; whilst young, his claspers resemble those of the female. class, arachnida (spiders). the sexes do not generally differ much in colour, but the males are often darker than the females, as may be seen in mr. blackwall's magnificent work. (18. 'a history of the spiders of great britain,' 1861-64. for the following facts, see pp. 77, 88, 102.) in some species, however, the difference is conspicuous: thus the female of sparassus smaragdulus is dullish green, whilst the adult male has the abdomen of a fine yellow, with three longitudinal stripes of rich red. in certain species of thomisus the sexes closely resemble each other, in others they differ much; and analogous cases occur in many other genera. it is often difficult to say which of the two sexes departs most from the ordinary coloration of the genus to which the species belong; but mr. blackwall thinks that, as a general rule, it is the male; and canestrini (19. this author has recently published a valuable essay on the 'caratteri sessuali secondarii degli arachnidi,' in the 'atti della soc. veneto-trentina di sc. nat. padova,' vol. i. fasc. 3, 1873.) remarks that in certain genera the males can be specifically distinguished with ease, but the females with great difficulty. i am informed by mr. blackwall that the sexes whilst young usually resemble each other; and both often undergo great changes in colour during their successive moults, before arriving at maturity. in other cases the male alone appears to change colour. thus the male of the above bright-coloured sparassus at first resembles the female, and acquires his peculiar tints only when nearly adult. spiders are possessed of acute senses, and exhibit much intelligence; as is well known, the females often shew the strongest affection for their eggs, which they carry about enveloped in a silken web. the males search eagerly for the females, and have been seen by canestrini and others to fight for possession of them. this same author says that the union of the two sexes has been observed in about twenty species; and he asserts positively that the female rejects some of the males who court her, threatens them with open mandibles, and at last after long hesitation accepts the chosen one. from these several considerations, we may admit with some confidence that the well-marked differences in colour between the sexes of certain species are the results of sexual selection; though we have not here the best kind of evidence,-- the display by the male of his ornaments. from the extreme variability of colour in the male of some species, for instance of theridion lineatum, it would appear that these sexual characters of the males have not as yet become well fixed. canestrini draws the same conclusion from the fact that the males of certain species present two forms, differing from each other in the size and length of their jaws; and this reminds us of the above cases of dimorphic crustaceans. the male is generally much smaller than the female, sometimes to an extraordinary degree (20. aug. vinson ('araneides des iles de la reunion,' pl. vi. figs. 1 and 2) gives a good instance of the small size of the male, in epeira nigra. in this species, as i may add, the male is testaceous and the female black with legs banded with red. other even more striking cases of inequality in size between the sexes have been recorded ('quarterly journal of science,' july 1868, p. 429); but i have not seen the original accounts.), and he is forced to be extremely cautious in making his advances, as the female often carries her coyness to a dangerous pitch. de geer saw a male that "in the midst of his preparatory caresses was seized by the object of his attentions, enveloped by her in a web and then devoured, a sight which, as he adds, filled him with horror and indignation." (21. kirby and spence, 'introduction to entomology,' vol. i. 1818, p. 280.) the rev. o.p. cambridge (22. 'proceedings, zoological society,' 1871, p. 621.) accounts in the following manner for the extreme smallness of the male in the genus nephila. "m. vinson gives a graphic account of the agile way in which the diminutive male escapes from the ferocity of the female, by gliding about and playing hide and seek over her body and along her gigantic limbs: in such a pursuit it is evident that the chances of escape would be in favour of the smallest males, while the larger ones would fall early victims; thus gradually a diminutive race of males would be selected, until at last they would dwindle to the smallest possible size compatible with the exercise of their generative functions,-- in fact, probably to the size we now see them, i.e., so small as to be a sort of parasite upon the female, and either beneath her notice, or too agile and too small for her to catch without great difficulty." westring has made the interesting discovery that the males of several species of theridion (23. theridion (asagena, sund.) serratipes, 4- punctatum et guttatum; see westring, in kroyer, 'naturhist. tidskrift,' vol. iv. 1842-1843, p. 349; and vol. ii. 1846-1849, p. 342. see, also, for other species, 'araneae suecicae,' p. 184.) have the power of making a stridulating sound, whilst the females are mute. the apparatus consists of a serrated ridge at the base of the abdomen, against which the hard hinder part of the thorax is rubbed; and of this structure not a trace can be detected in the females. it deserves notice that several writers, including the well-known arachnologist walckenaer, have declared that spiders are attracted by music. (24. dr. h.h. van zouteveen, in his dutch translation of this work (vol. i. p. 444), has collected several cases.) from the analogy of the orthoptera and homoptera, to be described in the next chapter, we may feel almost sure that the stridulation serves, as westring also believes, to call or to excite the female; and this is the first case known to me in the ascending scale of the animal kingdom of sounds emitted for this purpose. (25. hilgendorf, however, has lately called attention to an analogous structure in some of the higher crustaceans, which seems adapted to produce sound; see 'zoological record,' 1869, p. 603.) class, myriapoda. in neither of the two orders in this class, the millipedes and centipedes, can i find any well-marked instances of such sexual differences as more particularly concern us. in glomeris limbata, however, and perhaps in some few other species, the males differ slightly in colour from the females; but this glomeris is a highly variable species. in the males of the diplopoda, the legs belonging either to one of the anterior or of the posterior segments of the body are modified into prehensile hooks which serve to secure the female. in some species of iulus the tarsi of the male are furnished with membranous suckers for the same purpose. as we shall see when we treat of insects, it is a much more unusual circumstance, that it is the female in lithobius, which is furnished with prehensile appendages at the extremity of her body for holding the male. (26. walckenaer et p. gervais, 'hist. nat. des insectes: apteres,' tom. iv. 1847, pp. 17, 19, 68.) chapter x. secondary sexual characters of insects. diversified structures possessed by the males for seizing the females-- differences between the sexes, of which the meaning is not understood-- difference in size between the sexes--thysanura--diptera--hemiptera-- homoptera, musical powers possessed by the males alone--orthoptera, musical instruments of the males, much diversified in structure; pugnacity; colours--neuroptera, sexual differences in colour--hymenoptera, pugnacity and odours--coleoptera, colours; furnished with great horns, apparently as an ornament; battles, stridulating organs generally common to both sexes. in the immense class of insects the sexes sometimes differ in their locomotive-organs, and often in their sense-organs, as in the pectinated and beautifully plumose antennae of the males of many species. in chloeon, one of the ephemerae, the male has great pillared eyes, of which the female is entirely destitute. (1. sir j. lubbock, 'transact. linnean soc.' vol. xxv, 1866, p. 484. with respect to the mutillidae see westwood, 'modern class. of insects,' vol. ii. p. 213.) the ocelli are absent in the females of certain insects, as in the mutillidae; and here the females are likewise wingless. but we are chiefly concerned with structures by which one male is enabled to conquer another, either in battle or courtship, through his strength, pugnacity, ornaments, or music. the innumerable contrivances, therefore, by which the male is able to seize the female, may be briefly passed over. besides the complex structures at the apex of the abdomen, which ought perhaps to be ranked as primary organs (2. these organs in the male often differ in closely-allied species, and afford excellent specific characters. but their importance, from a functional point of view, as mr. r. maclachlan has remarked to me, has probably been overrated. it has been suggested, that slight differences in these organs would suffice to prevent the intercrossing of well-marked varieties or incipient species, and would thus aid in their development. that this can hardly be the case, we may infer from the many recorded cases (see, for instance, bronn, 'geschichte der natur,' b. ii. 1843, s. 164; and westwood, 'transact. ent. soc.' vol. iii. 1842, p. 195) of distinct species having been observed in union. mr. maclachlan informs me (vide 'stett. ent. zeitung,' 1867, s. 155) that when several species of phryganidae, which present strongly-pronounced differences of this kind, were confined together by dr. aug. meyer, they coupled, and one pair produced fertile ova.), "it is astonishing," as mr. b.d. walsh (3. 'the practical entomologist,' philadelphia, vol. ii. may 1867, p. 88.) has remarked, "how many different organs are worked in by nature for the seemingly insignificant object of enabling the male to grasp the female firmly." the mandibles or jaws are sometimes used for this purpose; thus the male corydalis cornutus (a neuropterous insect in some degree allied to the dragon flies, etc.) has immense curved jaws, many times longer than those of the female; and they are smooth instead of being toothed, so that he is thus enabled to seize her without injury. (4. mr. walsh, ibid. p. 107.) one of the stag-beetles of north america (lucanus elaphus) uses his jaws, which are much larger than those of the female, for the same purpose, but probably likewise for fighting. in one of the sand- wasps (ammophila) the jaws in the two sexes are closely alike, but are used for widely different purposes: the males, as professor westwood observes, "are exceedingly ardent, seizing their partners round the neck with their sickle-shaped jaws" (5. 'modern classification of insects,' vol. ii. 1840, pp. 205, 206. mr. walsh, who called my attention to the double use of the jaws, says that he has repeatedly observed this fact.); whilst the females use these organs for burrowing in sand-banks and making their nests. [fig. 9. crabro cribrarius. upper figure, male; lower figure, female.] the tarsi of the front-legs are dilated in many male beetles, or are furnished with broad cushions of hairs; and in many genera of water-beetles they are armed with a round flat sucker, so that the male may adhere to the slippery body of the female. it is a much more unusual circumstance that the females of some water-beetles (dytiscus) have their elytra deeply grooved, and in acilius sulcatus thickly set with hairs, as an aid to the male. the females of some other water-beetles (hydroporus) have their elytra punctured for the same purpose. (6. we have here a curious and inexplicable case of dimorphism, for some of the females of four european species of dytiscus, and of certain species of hydroporus, have their elytra smooth; and no intermediate gradations between the sulcated or punctured, and the quite smooth elytra have been observed. see dr. h. schaum, as quoted in the 'zoologist,' vols. v.-vi. 1847-48, p. 1896. also kirby and spence, 'introduction to entomology,' vol. iii. 1826, p. 305.) in the male of crabro cribrarius (fig. 9), it is the tibia which is dilated into a broad horny plate, with minute membraneous dots, giving to it a singular appearance like that of a riddle. (7. westwood, 'modern class.' vol. ii. p. 193. the following statement about penthe, and others in inverted commas, are taken from mr. walsh, 'practical entomologist,' philadelphia, vol. iii. p. 88.) in the male of penthe (a genus of beetles) a few of the middle joints of the antennae are dilated and furnished on the inferior surface with cushions of hair, exactly like those on the tarsi of the carabidae, "and obviously for the same end." in male dragon-flies, "the appendages at the tip of the tail are modified in an almost infinite variety of curious patterns to enable them to embrace the neck of the female." lastly, in the males of many insects, the legs are furnished with peculiar spines, knobs or spurs; or the whole leg is bowed or thickened, but this is by no means invariably a sexual character; or one pair, or all three pairs are elongated, sometimes to an extravagant length. (8. kirby and spence, 'introduct.' etc., vol. iii. pp. 332-336.) [fig. 10. taphroderes distortus (much enlarged). upper figure, male; lower figure, female.] the sexes of many species in all the orders present differences, of which the meaning is not understood. one curious case is that of a beetle (fig. 10), the male of which has left mandible much enlarged; so that the mouth is greatly distorted. in another carabidous beetle, eurygnathus (9. 'insecta maderensia,' 1854, page 20.), we have the case, unique as far as known to mr. wollaston, of the head of the female being much broader and larger, though in a variable degree, than that of the male. any number of such cases could be given. they abound in the lepidoptera: one of the most extraordinary is that certain male butterflies have their fore-legs more or less atrophied, with the tibiae and tarsi reduced to mere rudimentary knobs. the wings, also, in the two sexes often differ in neuration (10. e. doubleday, 'annals and mag. of nat. hist.' vol. i. 1848, p. 379. i may add that the wings in certain hymenoptera (see shuckard, 'fossorial hymenoptera,' 1837, pp. 39-43) differ in neuration according to sex.), and sometimes considerably in outline, as in the aricoris epitus, which was shewn to me in the british museum by mr. a. butler. the males of certain south american butterflies have tufts of hair on the margins of the wings, and horny excrescences on the discs of the posterior pair. (11. h.w. bates, in 'journal of proc. linn. soc.' vol. vi. 1862, p. 74. mr. wonfor's observations are quoted in 'popular science review,' 1868, p. 343.) in several british butterflies, as shewn by mr. wonfor, the males alone are in parts clothed with peculiar scales. the use of the bright light of the female glow-worm has been subject to much discussion. the male is feebly luminous, as are the larvae and even the eggs. it has been supposed by some authors that the light serves to frighten away enemies, and by others to guide the male to the female. at last, mr. belt (12. 'the naturalist in nicaragua,' 1874, pp. 316-320. on the phosphorescence of the eggs, see 'annals and magazine of natural history,' nov. 1871, p. 372.) appears to have solved the difficulty: he finds that all the lampyridae which he has tried are highly distasteful to insectivorous mammals and birds. hence it is in accordance with mr. bates' view, hereafter to be explained, that many insects mimic the lampyridae closely, in order to be mistaken for them, and thus to escape destruction. he further believes that the luminous species profit by being at once recognised as unpalatable. it is probable that the same explanation may be extended to the elaters, both sexes of which are highly luminous. it is not known why the wings of the female glow-worm have not been developed; but in her present state she closely resembles a larva, and as larvae are so largely preyed on by many animals, we can understand why she has been rendered so much more luminous and conspicuous than the male; and why the larvae themselves are likewise luminous. difference in size between the sexes. with insects of all kinds the males are commonly smaller than the females; and this difference can often be detected even in the larval state. so considerable is the difference between the male and female cocoons of the silk-moth (bombyx mori), that in france they are separated by a particular mode of weighing. (13. robinet, 'vers a soie,' 1848, p. 207.) in the lower classes of the animal kingdom, the greater size of the females seems generally to depend on their developing an enormous number of ova; and this may to a certain extent hold good with insects. but dr. wallace has suggested a much more probable explanation. he finds, after carefully attending to the development of the caterpillars of bombyx cynthia and yamamai, and especially to that of some dwarfed caterpillars reared from a second brood on unnatural food, "that in proportion as the individual moth is finer, so is the time required for its metamorphosis longer; and for this reason the female, which is the larger and heavier insect, from having to carry her numerous eggs, will be preceded by the male, which is smaller and has less to mature." (14. 'transact. ent. soc.' 3rd series, vol. v. p. 486.) now as most insects are short-lived, and as they are exposed to many dangers, it would manifestly be advantageous to the female to be impregnated as soon as possible. this end would be gained by the males being first matured in large numbers ready for the advent of the females; and this again would naturally follow, as mr. a.r. wallace has remarked (15. 'journal of proc. ent. soc.' feb. 4, 1867, p. lxxi.), through natural selection; for the smaller males would be first matured, and thus would procreate a large number of offspring which would inherit the reduced size of their male parents, whilst the larger males from being matured later would leave fewer offspring. there are, however, exceptions to the rule of male insects being smaller than the females: and some of these exceptions are intelligible. size and strength would be an advantage to the males, which fight for the possession of the females; and in these cases, as with the stag-beetle (lucanus), the males are larger than the females. there are, however, other beetles which are not known to fight together, of which the males exceed the females in size; and the meaning of this fact is not known; but in some of these cases, as with the huge dynastes and megasoma, we can at least see that there would be no necessity for the males to be smaller than the females, in order to be matured before them, for these beetles are not short-lived, and there would be ample time for the pairing of the sexes. so again, male dragon-flies (libellulidae) are sometimes sensibly larger, and never smaller, than the females (16. for this and other statements on the size of the sexes, see kirby and spence, ibid. vol. iii. p. 300; on the duration of life in insects, see p. 344.); and as mr. maclachlan believes, they do not generally pair with the females until a week or fortnight has elapsed, and until they have assumed their proper masculine colours. but the most curious case, shewing on what complex and easily-overlooked relations, so trifling a character as difference in size between the sexes may depend, is that of the aculeate hymenoptera; for mr. f. smith informs me that throughout nearly the whole of this large group, the males, in accordance with the general rule, are smaller than the females, and emerge about a week before them; but amongst the bees, the males of apis mellifica, anthidium manicatum, and anthophora acervorum, and amongst the fossores, the males of the methoca ichneumonides, are larger than the females. the explanation of this anomaly is that a marriage flight is absolutely necessary with these species, and the male requires great strength and size in order to carry the female through the air. increased size has here been acquired in opposition to the usual relation between size and the period of development, for the males, though larger, emerge before the smaller females. we will now review the several orders, selecting such facts as more particularly concern us. the lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) will be retained for a separate chapter. order, thysanura. the members of this lowly organised order are wingless, dull-coloured, minute insects, with ugly, almost misshapen heads and bodies. their sexes do not differ, but they are interesting as shewing us that the males pay sedulous court to the females even low down in the animal scale. sir j. lubbock (17. 'transact. linnean soc.' vol. xxvi. 1868, p. 296.) says: "it is very amusing to see these little creatures (smynthurus luteus) coquetting together. the male, which is much smaller than the female, runs round her, and they butt one another, standing face to face and moving backward and forward like two playful lambs. then the female pretends to run away and the male runs after her with a queer appearance of anger, gets in front and stands facing her again; then she turns coyly round, but he, quicker and more active, scuttles round too, and seems to whip her with his antennae; then for a bit they stand face to face, play with their antennae, and seem to be all in all to one another." order, diptera (flies). the sexes differ little in colour. the greatest difference, known to mr. f. walker, is in the genus bibio, in which the males are blackish or quite black, and the females obscure brownish-orange. the genus elaphomyia, discovered by mr. wallace (18. 'the malay archipelago,' vol. ii. 1869, p. 313.) in new guinea, is highly remarkable, as the males are furnished with horns, of which the females are quite destitute. the horns spring from beneath the eyes, and curiously resemble those of a stag, being either branched or palmated. in one of the species, they equal the whole body in length. they might be thought to be adapted for fighting, but as in one species they are of a beautiful pink colour, edged with black, with a pale central stripe, and as these insects have altogether a very elegant appearance, it is perhaps more probable that they serve as ornaments. that the males of some diptera fight together is certain; prof. westwood (19. 'modern classification of insects,' vol. ii. 1840, p. 526.) has several times seen this with the tipulae. the males of other diptera apparently try to win the females by their music: h. müller (20. 'anwendung,' etc., 'verh. d. n. v. jahrg.' xxix. p. 80. mayer, in 'american naturalist,' 1874, p. 236.) watched for some time two males of an eristalis courting a female; they hovered above her, and flew from side to side, making a high humming noise at the same time. gnats and mosquitoes (culicidae) also seem to attract each other by humming; and prof. mayer has recently ascertained that the hairs on the antennae of the male vibrate in unison with the notes of a tuning-fork, within the range of the sounds emitted by the female. the longer hairs vibrate sympathetically with the graver notes, and the shorter hairs with the higher ones. landois also asserts that he has repeatedly drawn down a whole swarm of gnats by uttering a particular note. it may be added that the mental faculties of the diptera are probably higher than in most other insects, in accordance with their highly- developed nervous system. (21. see mr. b.t. lowne's interesting work, 'on the anatomy of the blow-fly, musca vomitoria,' 1870, p. 14. he remarks (p. 33) that, "the captured flies utter a peculiar plaintive note, and that this sound causes other flies to disappear.") order, hemiptera (field-bugs). mr. j.w. douglas, who has particularly attended to the british species, has kindly given me an account of their sexual differences. the males of some species are furnished with wings, whilst the females are wingless; the sexes differ in the form of their bodies, elytra, antennae and tarsi; but as the signification of these differences are unknown, they may be here passed over. the females are generally larger and more robust than the males. with british, and, as far as mr. douglas knows, with exotic species, the sexes do not commonly differ much in colour; but in about six british species the male is considerably darker than the female, and in about four other species the female is darker than the male. both sexes of some species are beautifully coloured; and as these insects emit an extremely nauseous odour, their conspicuous colours may serve as a signal that they are unpalatable to insectivorous animals. in some few cases their colours appear to be directly protective: thus prof. hoffmann informs me that he could hardly distinguish a small pink and green species from the buds on the trunks of lime-trees, which this insect frequents. some species of reduvidae make a stridulating noise; and, in the case of pirates stridulus, this is said (22. westwood, 'modern classification of insects,' vol. ii. p. 473.) to be effected by the movement of the neck within the pro-thoracic cavity. according to westring, reduvius personatus also stridulates. but i have no reason to suppose that this is a sexual character, excepting that with non-social insects there seems to be no use for sound-producing organs, unless it be as a sexual call. order: homoptera. every one who has wandered in a tropical forest must have been astonished at the din made by the male cicadae. the females are mute; as the grecian poet xenarchus says, "happy the cicadas live, since they all have voiceless wives." the noise thus made could be plainly heard on board the "beagle," when anchored at a quarter of a mile from the shore of brazil; and captain hancock says it can be heard at the distance of a mile. the greeks formerly kept, and the chinese now keep these insects in cages for the sake of their song, so that it must be pleasing to the ears of some men. (23. these particulars are taken from westwood's 'modern classification of insects,' vol. ii. 1840, p. 422. see, also, on the fulgoridae, kirby and spence, 'introduct.' vol. ii. p. 401.) the cicadidae usually sing during the day, whilst the fulgoridae appear to be night-songsters. the sound, according to landois (24. 'zeitschrift für wissenschaft. zoolog.' b. xvii. 1867, ss. 152-158.), is produced by the vibration of the lips of the spiracles, which are set into motion by a current of air emitted from the tracheae; but this view has lately been disputed. dr. powell appears to have proved (25. 'transactions of the new zealand institute,' vol. v. 1873, p. 286.) that it is produced by the vibration of a membrane, set into action by a special muscle. in the living insect, whilst stridulating, this membrane can be seen to vibrate; and in the dead insect the proper sound is heard, if the muscle, when a little dried and hardened, is pulled with the point of a pin. in the female the whole complex musical apparatus is present, but is much less developed than in the male, and is never used for producing sound. with respect to the object of the music, dr. hartman, in speaking of the cicada septemdecim of the united states, says (26. i am indebted to mr. walsh for having sent me this extract from 'a journal of the doings of cicada septemdecim,' by dr. hartman.), "the drums are now (june 6th and 7th, 1851) heard in all directions. this i believe to be the marital summons from the males. standing in thick chestnut sprouts about as high as my head, where hundreds were around me, i observed the females coming around the drumming males." he adds, "this season (aug. 1868) a dwarf pear-tree in my garden produced about fifty larvae of cic. pruinosa; and i several times noticed the females to alight near a male while he was uttering his clanging notes." fritz müller writes to me from s. brazil that he has often listened to a musical contest between two or three males of a species with a particularly loud voice, seated at a considerable distance from each other: as soon as one had finished his song, another immediately began, and then another. as there is so much rivalry between the males, it is probable that the females not only find them by their sounds, but that, like female birds, they are excited or allured by the male with the most attractive voice. i have not heard of any well-marked cases of ornamental differences between the sexes of the homoptera. mr. douglas informs me that there are three british species, in which the male is black or marked with black bands, whilst the females are pale-coloured or obscure. order, orthoptera (crickets and grasshoppers). the males in the three saltatorial families in this order are remarkable for their musical powers, namely the achetidae or crickets, the locustidae for which there is no equivalent english name, and the acridiidae or grasshoppers. the stridulation produced by some of the locustidae is so loud that it can be heard during the night at the distance of a mile (27. l. guilding, 'transactions of the linnean society,' vol. xv. p. 154.); and that made by certain species is not unmusical even to the human ear, so that the indians on the amazons keep them in wicker cages. all observers agree that the sounds serve either to call or excite the mute females. with respect to the migratory locusts of russia, korte has given (28. i state this on the authority of koppen, 'über die heuschrecken in südrussland,' 1866, p. 32, for i have in vain endeavoured to procure korte's work.) an interesting case of selection by the female of a male. the males of this species (pachytylus migratorius) whilst coupled with the female stridulate from anger or jealousy, if approached by other males. the house-cricket when surprised at night uses its voice to warn its fellows. (29. gilbert white, 'natural history of selborne,' vol. ii. 1825, p. 262.) in north america the katy-did (platyphyllum concavum, one of the locustidae) is described (30. harris, 'insects of new england,' 1842, p. 128.) as mounting on the upper branches of a tree, and in the evening beginning "his noisy babble, while rival notes issue from the neighbouring trees, and the groves resound with the call of katy-did-she- did the live-long night." mr. bates, in speaking of the european field- cricket (one of the achetidae), says "the male has been observed to place himself in the evening at the entrance of his burrow, and stridulate until a female approaches, when the louder notes are succeeded by a more subdued tone, whilst the successful musician caresses with his antennae the mate he has won." (31. 'the naturalist on the amazons,' vol. i. 1863, p. 252. mr. bates gives a very interesting discussion on the gradations in the musical apparatus of the three families. see also westwood, 'modern classification of insects,' vol. ii. pp. 445 and 453.) dr. scudder was able to excite one of these insects to answer him, by rubbing on a file with a quill. (32. 'proceedings of the boston society of natural history,' vol. xi. april 1868.) in both sexes a remarkable auditory apparatus has been discovered by von siebold, situated in the front legs. (33. 'nouveau manuel d'anat. comp.' (french translat.), tom. 1, 1850, p. 567.) [fig.11. gryllus campestris (from landois). right-hand figure, under side of part of a wing-nervure, much magnified, showing the teeth, st. left-hand figure, upper surface of wing-cover, with the projecting, smooth nervure, r, across which the teeth (st) are scraped. fig.12. teeth of nervure of gryllus domesticus (from landois).] in the three families the sounds are differently produced. in the males of the achetidae both wing-covers have the same apparatus; and this in the field-cricket (see gryllus campestris, fig. 11) consists, as described by landois (34. 'zeitschrift für wissenschaft. zoolog.' b. xvii. 1867, s. 117.), of from 131 to 138 sharp, transverse ridges or teeth (st) on the under side of one of the nervures of the wing-cover. this toothed nervure is rapidly scraped across a projecting, smooth, hard nervure (r) on the upper surface of the opposite wing. first one wing is rubbed over the other, and then the movement is reversed. both wings are raised a little at the same time, so as to increase the resonance. in some species the wing-covers of the males are furnished at the base with a talc-like plate. (35. westwood, 'modern classification of insects,' vol. i. p. 440.) i here give a drawing (fig. 12) of the teeth on the under side of the nervure of another species of gryllus, viz., g. domesticus. with respect to the formation of these teeth, dr. gruber has shewn (36. 'ueber der tonapparat der locustiden, ein beitrag zum darwinismus,' 'zeitschrift für wissenschaft. zoolog.' b. xxii. 1872, p. 100.) that they have been developed by the aid of selection, from the minute scales and hairs with which the wings and body are covered, and i came to the same conclusion with respect to those of the coleoptera. but dr. gruber further shews that their development is in part directly due to the stimulus from the friction of one wing over the other. [fig.13. chlorocoelus tanana (from bates). a,b. lobes of opposite wing-covers.] in the locustidae the opposite wing-covers differ from each other in structure (fig. 13), and the action cannot, as in the last family, be reversed. the left wing, which acts as the bow, lies over the right wing which serves as the fiddle. one of the nervures (a) on the under surface of the former is finely serrated, and is scraped across the prominent nervures on the upper surface of the opposite or right wing. in our british phasgonura viridissima it appeared to me that the serrated nervure is rubbed against the rounded hind-corner of the opposite wing, the edge of which is thickened, coloured brown, and very sharp. in the right wing, but not in the left, there is a little plate, as transparent as talc, surrounded by nervures, and called the speculum. in ephippiger vitium, a member of this same family, we have a curious subordinate modification; for the wing-covers are greatly reduced in size, but "the posterior part of the pro-thorax is elevated into a kind of dome over the wing-covers, and which has probably the effect of increasing the sound." (37. westwood 'modern classification of insects,' vol. i. p. 453.) we thus see that the musical apparatus is more differentiated or specialised in the locustidae (which include, i believe, the most powerful performers in the order), than in the achetidae, in which both wing-covers have the same structure and the same function. (38. landois, 'zeitschrift für wissenschaft. zoolog.' b. xvii. 1867, ss. 121, 122.) landois, however, detected in one of the locustidae, namely in decticus, a short and narrow row of small teeth, mere rudiments, on the inferior surface of the right wing-cover, which underlies the other and is never used as the bow. i observed the same rudimentary structure on the under side of the right wing-cover in phasgonura viridissima. hence we may infer with confidence that the locustidae are descended from a form, in which, as in the existing achetidae, both wing-covers had serrated nervures on the under surface, and could be indifferently used as the bow; but that in the locustidae the two wing-covers gradually became differentiated and perfected, on the principle of the division of labour, the one to act exclusively as the bow, and the other as the fiddle. dr. gruber takes the same view, and has shewn that rudimentary teeth are commonly found on the inferior surface of the right wing. by what steps the more simple apparatus in the achetidae originated, we do not know, but it is probable that the basal portions of the wing- covers originally overlapped each other as they do at present; and that the friction of the nervures produced a grating sound, as is now the case with the wing-covers of the females. (39. mr. walsh also informs me that he has noticed that the female of the platyphyllum concavum, "when captured makes a feeble grating noise by shuffling her wing-covers together.") a grating sound thus occasionally and accidentally made by the males, if it served them ever so little as a love-call to the females, might readily have been intensified through sexual selection, by variations in the roughness of the nervures having been continually preserved. [fig.14. hind-leg of stenobothrus pratorum: r, the stridulating ridge; lower figure, the teeth forming the ridge, much magnified (from landois). fig.15. pneumora (from specimens in the british museum). upper figure, male; lower figure, female.] in the last and third family, namely the acridiidae or grasshoppers, the stridulation is produced in a very different manner, and according to dr. scudder, is not so shrill as in the preceding families. the inner surface of the femur (fig. 14, r) is furnished with a longitudinal row of minute, elegant, lancet-shaped, elastic teeth, from 85 to 93 in number (40. landois, ibid. s. 113.); and these are scraped across the sharp, projecting nervures on the wing-covers, which are thus made to vibrate and resound. harris (41. 'insects of new england,' 1842, p. 133.) says that when one of the males begins to play, he first "bends the shank of the hind-leg beneath the thigh, where it is lodged in a furrow designed to receive it, and then draws the leg briskly up and down. he does not play both fiddles together, but alternately, first upon one and then on the other." in many species, the base of the abdomen is hollowed out into a great cavity which is believed to act as a resounding board. in pneumora (fig. 15), a s. african genus belonging to the same family, we meet with a new and remarkable modification; in the males a small notched ridge projects obliquely from each side of the abdomen, against which the hind femora are rubbed. (42. westwood, 'modern classification,' vol i. p. 462.) as the male is furnished with wings (the female being wingless), it is remarkable that the thighs are not rubbed in the usual manner against the wing-covers; but this may perhaps be accounted for by the unusually small size of the hind-legs. i have not been able to examine the inner surface of the thighs, which, judging from analogy, would be finely serrated. the species of pneumora have been more profoundly modified for the sake of stridulation than any other orthopterous insect; for in the male the whole body has been converted into a musical instrument, being distended with air, like a great pellucid bladder, so as to increase the resonance. mr. trimen informs me that at the cape of good hope these insects make a wonderful noise during the night. in the three foregoing families, the females are almost always destitute of an efficient musical apparatus. but there are a few exceptions to this rule, for dr. gruber has shewn that both sexes of ephippiger vitium are thus provided; though the organs differ in the male and female to a certain extent. hence we cannot suppose that they have been transferred from the male to the female, as appears to have been the case with the secondary sexual characters of many other animals. they must have been independently developed in the two sexes, which no doubt mutually call to each other during the season of love. in most other locustidae (but not according to landois in decticus) the females have rudiments of the stridulatory organs proper to the male; from whom it is probable that these have been transferred. landois also found such rudiments on the under surface of the wing-covers of the female achetidae, and on the femora of the female acridiidae. in the homoptera, also, the females have the proper musical apparatus in a functionless state; and we shall hereafter meet in other divisions of the animal kingdom with many instances of structures proper to the male being present in a rudimentary condition in the female. landois has observed another important fact, namely, that in the females of the acridiidae, the stridulating teeth on the femora remain throughout life in the same condition in which they first appear during the larval state in both sexes. in the males, on the other hand, they become further developed, and acquire their perfect structure at the last moult, when the insect is mature and ready to breed. from the facts now given, we see that the means by which the males of the orthoptera produce their sounds are extremely diversified, and are altogether different from those employed by the homoptera. (43. landois has recently found in certain orthoptera rudimentary structures closely similar to the sound-producing organs in the homoptera; and this is a surprising fact. see 'zeitschrift für wissenschaft, zoolog.' b. xxii. heft 3, 1871, p. 348.) but throughout the animal kingdom we often find the same object gained by the most diversified means; this seems due to the whole organisation having undergone multifarious changes in the course of ages, and as part after part varied different variations were taken advantage of for the same general purpose. the diversity of means for producing sound in the three families of the orthoptera and in the homoptera, impresses the mind with the high importance of these structures to the males, for the sake of calling or alluring the females. we need feel no surprise at the amount of modification which the orthoptera have undergone in this respect, as we now know, from dr. scudder's remarkable discovery (44. 'transactions, entomological society,' 3rd series, vol. ii. ('journal of proceedings,' p. 117).), that there has been more than ample time. this naturalist has lately found a fossil insect in the devonian formation of new brunswick, which is furnished with "the well-known tympanum or stridulating apparatus of the male locustidae." the insect, though in most respects related to the neuroptera, appears, as is so often the case with very ancient forms, to connect the two related orders of the neuroptera and orthoptera. i have but little more to say on the orthoptera. some of the species are very pugnacious: when two male field-crickets (gryllus campestris) are confined together, they fight till one kills the other; and the species of mantis are described as manoeuvring with their sword-like front-limbs, like hussars with their sabres. the chinese keep these insects in little bamboo cages, and match them like game-cocks. (45. westwood, 'modern classification of insects,' vol. i. p. 427; for crickets, p. 445.) with respect to colour, some exotic locusts are beautifully ornamented; the posterior wings being marked with red, blue, and black; but as throughout the order the sexes rarely differ much in colour, it is not probable that they owe their bright tints to sexual selection. conspicuous colours may be of use to these insects, by giving notice that they are unpalatable. thus it has been observed (46. mr. ch. horne, in 'proceedings of the entomological society,' may 3, 1869, p. xii.) that a bright-coloured indian locust was invariably rejected when offered to birds and lizards. some cases, however, are known of sexual differences in colour in this order. the male of an american cricket (47. the oecanthus nivalis, harris, 'insects of new england,' 1842, p. 124. the two sexes of oe. pellucidus of europe differ, as i hear from victor carus, in nearly the same manner.) is described as being as white as ivory, whilst the female varies from almost white to greenish-yellow or dusky. mr. walsh informs me that the adult male of spectrum femoratum (one of the phasmidae) "is of a shining brownish-yellow colour; the adult female being of a dull, opaque, cinereous brown; the young of both sexes being green." lastly, i may mention that the male of one curious kind of cricket (48. platyblemnus: westwood, 'modern classification,' vol. i. p. 447.) is furnished with "a long membranous appendage, which falls over the face like a veil;" but what its use may be, is not known. order, neuroptera. little need here be said, except as to colour. in the ephemeridae the sexes often differ slightly in their obscure tints (49. b.d. walsh, the 'pseudo-neuroptera of illinois,' in 'proceedings of the entomological society of philadelphia,' 1862, p. 361.); but it is not probable that the males are thus rendered attractive to the females. the libellulidae, or dragon-flies, are ornamented with splendid green, blue, yellow, and vermilion metallic tints; and the sexes often differ. thus, as prof. westwood remarks (50. 'modern classification,' vol. ii. p. 37.), the males of some of the agrionidae, "are of a rich blue with black wings, whilst the females are fine green with colourless wings." but in agrion ramburii these colours are exactly reversed in the two sexes. (51. walsh, ibid. p. 381. i am indebted to this naturalist for the following facts on hetaerina, anax, and gomphus.) in the extensive n. american genus of hetaerina, the males alone have a beautiful carmine spot at the base of each wing. in anax junius the basal part of the abdomen in the male is a vivid ultramarine blue, and in the female grass-green. in the allied genus gomphus, on the other hand, and in some other genera, the sexes differ but little in colour. in closely-allied forms throughout the animal kingdom, similar cases of the sexes differing greatly, or very little, or not at all, are of frequent occurrence. although there is so wide a difference in colour between the sexes of many libellulidae, it is often difficult to say which is the more brilliant; and the ordinary coloration of the two sexes is reversed, as we have just seen, in one species of agrion. it is not probable that their colours in any case have been gained as a protection. mr. maclachlan, who has closely attended to this family, writes to me that dragon-flies--the tyrants of the insect-world--are the least liable of any insect to be attacked by birds or other enemies, and he believes that their bright colours serve as a sexual attraction. certain dragon-flies apparently are attracted by particular colours: mr. patterson observed (52. 'transactions, ent. soc.' vol. i. 1836, p. lxxxi.) that the agrionidae, of which the males are blue, settled in numbers on the blue float of a fishing line; whilst two other species were attracted by shining white colours. it is an interesting fact, first noticed by schelver, that, in several genera belonging to two sub-families, the males on first emergence from the pupal state, are coloured exactly like the females; but that their bodies in a short time assume a conspicuous milky-blue tint, owing to the exudation of a kind of oil, soluble in ether and alcohol. mr. maclachlan believes that in the male of libellula depressa this change of colour does not occur until nearly a fortnight after the metamorphosis, when the sexes are ready to pair. certain species of neurothemis present, according to brauer (53. see abstract in the 'zoological record' for 1867, p. 450.), a curious case of dimorphism, some of the females having ordinary wings, whilst others have them "very richly netted, as in the males of the same species." brauer "explains the phenomenon on darwinian principles by the supposition that the close netting of the veins is a secondary sexual character in the males, which has been abruptly transferred to some of the females, instead of, as generally occurs, to all of them." mr. maclachlan informs me of another instance of dimorphism in several species of agrion, in which some individuals are of an orange colour, and these are invariably females. this is probably a case of reversion; for in the true libellulae, when the sexes differ in colour, the females are orange or yellow; so that supposing agrion to be descended from some primordial form which resembled the typical libellulae in its sexual characters, it would not be surprising that a tendency to vary in this manner should occur in the females alone. although many dragon-flies are large, powerful, and fierce insects, the males have not been observed by mr. maclachlan to fight together, excepting, as he believes, in some of the smaller species of agrion. in another group in this order, namely, the termites or white ants, both sexes at the time of swarming may be seen running about, "the male after the female, sometimes two chasing one female, and contending with great eagerness who shall win the prize." (54. kirby and spence, 'introduction to entomology,' vol. ii. 1818, p. 35.) the atropos pulsatorius is said to make a noise with its jaws, which is answered by other individuals. (55. houzeau, 'les facultés mentales,' etc. tom. i. p. 104.) order, hymenoptera. that inimitable observer, m. fabre (56. see an interesting article, 'the writings of fabre,' in 'nat. hist. review,' april 1862, p. 122.), in describing the habits of cerceris, a wasp-like insect, remarks that "fights frequently ensue between the males for the possession of some particular female, who sits an apparently unconcerned beholder of the struggle for supremacy, and when the victory is decided, quietly flies away in company with the conqueror." westwood (57. 'journal of proceedings of entomological society,' sept. 7, 1863, p. 169.) says that the males of one of the saw-flies (tenthredinae) "have been found fighting together, with their mandibles locked." as m. fabre speaks of the males of cerceris striving to obtain a particular female, it may be well to bear in mind that insects belonging to this order have the power of recognising each other after long intervals of time, and are deeply attached. for instance, pierre huber, whose accuracy no one doubts, separated some ants, and when, after an interval of four months, they met others which had formerly belonged to the same community, they recognised and caressed one another with their antennae. had they been strangers they would have fought together. again, when two communities engage in a battle, the ants on the same side sometimes attack each other in the general confusion, but they soon perceive their mistake, and the one ant soothes the other. (58. p. huber, 'recherches sur les moeurs des fourmis,' 1810, pp. 150, 165.) in this order slight differences in colour, according to sex, are common, but conspicuous differences are rare except in the family of bees; yet both sexes of certain groups are so brilliantly coloured--for instance in chrysis, in which vermilion and metallic greens prevail--that we are tempted to attribute the result to sexual selection. in the ichneumonidae, according to mr. walsh (59. 'proceedings of the entomological society of philadelphia,' 1866, pp. 238, 239.), the males are almost universally lighter-coloured than the females. on the other hand, in the tenthredinidae the males are generally darker than the females. in the siricidae the sexes frequently differ; thus the male of sirex juvencus is banded with orange, whilst the female is dark purple; but it is difficult to say which sex is the more ornamented. in tremex columbae the female is much brighter coloured than the male. i am informed by mr. f. smith, that the male ants of several species are black, the females being testaceous. in the family of bees, especially in the solitary species, as i hear from the same entomologist, the sexes often differ in colour. the males are generally the brighter, and in bombus as well as in apathus, much more variable in colour than the females. in anthophora retusa the male is of a rich fulvous-brown, whilst the female is quite black: so are the females of several species of xylocopa, the males being bright yellow. on the other hand the females of some species, as of andraena fulva, are much brighter coloured than the males. such differences in colour can hardly be accounted for by the males being defenceless and thus requiring protection, whilst the females are well defended by their stings. h. müller (60. 'anwendung der darwinschen lehre auf bienen,' verh. d. n. v. jahrg. xxix.), who has particularly attended to the habits of bees, attributes these differences in colour in chief part to sexual selection. that bees have a keen perception of colour is certain. he says that the males search eagerly and fight for the possession of the females; and he accounts through such contests for the mandibles of the males being in certain species larger than those of the females. in some cases the males are far more numerous than the females, either early in the season, or at all times and places, or locally; whereas the females in other cases are apparently in excess. in some species the more beautiful males appear to have been selected by the females; and in others the more beautiful females by the males. consequently in certain genera (müller, p. 42), the males of the several species differ much in appearance, whilst the females are almost indistinguishable; in other genera the reverse occurs. h. müller believes (p. 82) that the colours gained by one sex through sexual selection have often been transferred in a variable degree to the other sex, just as the pollen-collecting apparatus of the female has often been transferred to the male, to whom it is absolutely useless. (61. m. perrier in his article 'la selection sexuelle d'après darwin' ('revue scientifique,' feb. 1873, p. 868), without apparently having reflected much on the subject, objects that as the males of social bees are known to be produced from unfertilised ova, they could not transmit new characters to their male offspring. this is an extraordinary objection. a female bee fertilised by a male, which presented some character facilitating the union of the sexes, or rendering him more attractive to the female, would lay eggs which would produce only females; but these young females would next year produce males; and will it be pretended that such males would not inherit the characters of their male grandfathers? to take a case with ordinary animals as nearly parallel as possible: if a female of any white quadruped or bird were crossed by a male of a black breed, and the male and female offspring were paired together, will it be pretended that the grandchildren would not inherit a tendency to blackness from their male grandfather? the acquirement of new characters by the sterile worker-bees is a much more difficult case, but i have endeavoured to shew in my 'origin of species,' how these sterile beings are subjected to the power of natural selection.) mutilla europaea makes a stridulating noise; and according to goureau (62. quoted by westwood, 'modern classification of insects,' vol. ii. p. 214.) both sexes have this power. he attributes the sound to the friction of the third and preceding abdominal segments, and i find that these surfaces are marked with very fine concentric ridges; but so is the projecting thoracic collar into which the head articulates, and this collar, when scratched with the point of a needle, emits the proper sound. it is rather surprising that both sexes should have the power of stridulating, as the male is winged and the female wingless. it is notorious that bees express certain emotions, as of anger, by the tone of their humming; and according to h. müller (p. 80), the males of some species make a peculiar singing noise whilst pursuing the females. order, coleoptera (beetles). many beetles are coloured so as to resemble the surfaces which they habitually frequent, and they thus escape detection by their enemies. other species, for instance diamond-beetles, are ornamented with splendid colours, which are often arranged in stripes, spots, crosses, and other elegant patterns. such colours can hardly serve directly as a protection, except in the case of certain flower-feeding species; but they may serve as a warning or means of recognition, on the same principle as the phosphorescence of the glow-worm. as with beetles the colours of the two sexes are generally alike, we have no evidence that they have been gained through sexual selection; but this is at least possible, for they have been developed in one sex and then transferred to the other; and this view is even in some degree probable in those groups which possess other well- marked secondary sexual characters. blind beetles, which cannot of course behold each other's beauty, never, as i hear from mr. waterhouse, jun., exhibit bright colours, though they often have polished coats; but the explanation of their obscurity may be that they generally inhabit caves and other obscure stations. some longicorns, especially certain prionidae, offer an exception to the rule that the sexes of beetles do not differ in colour. most of these insects are large and splendidly coloured. the males in the genus pyrodes (63. pyrodes pulcherrimus, in which the sexes differ conspicuously, has been described by mr. bates in 'transact. ent. soc.' 1869, p. 50. i will specify the few other cases in which i have heard of a difference in colour between the sexes of beetles. kirby and spence ('introduct. to entomology,' vol. iii. p. 301) mention a cantharis, meloe, rhagium, and the leptura testacea; the male of the latter being testaceous, with a black thorax, and the female of a dull red all over. these two latter beetles belong to the family of longicorns. messrs. r. trimen and waterhouse, jun., inform me of two lamellicorns, viz., a peritrichia and trichius, the male of the latter being more obscurely coloured than the female. in tillus elongatus the male is black, and the female always, as it is believed, of a dark blue colour, with a red thorax. the male, also, of orsodacna atra, as i hear from mr. walsh, is black, the female (the so- called o. ruficollis) having a rufous thorax.), which i saw in mr. bates's collection, are generally redder but rather duller than the females, the latter being coloured of a more or less splendid golden-green. on the other hand, in one species the male is golden-green, the female being richly tinted with red and purple. in the genus esmeralda the sexes differ so greatly in colour that they have been ranked as distinct species; in one species both are of a beautiful shining green, but the male has a red thorax. on the whole, as far as i could judge, the females of those prionidae, in which the sexes differ, are coloured more richly than the males, and this does not accord with the common rule in regard to colour, when acquired through sexual selection. [fig.16. chalcosoma atlas. upper figure, male (reduced); lower figure, female (nat. size). fig. 17. copris isidis. fig. 18. phanaeus faunus. fig. 19. dipelicus cantori. fig. 20. onthophagus rangifer, enlarged. (in figs. 17 to 20 the left-hand figures are males.)] a most remarkable distinction between the sexes of many beetles is presented by the great horns which rise from the head, thorax, and clypeus of the males; and in some few cases from the under surface of the body. these horns, in the great family of the lamellicorns, resemble those of various quadrupeds, such as stags, rhinoceroses, etc., and are wonderful both from their size and diversified shapes. instead of describing them, i have given figures of the males and females of some of the more remarkable forms. (figs. 16 to 20.) the females generally exhibit rudiments of the horns in the form of small knobs or ridges; but some are destitute of even the slightest rudiment. on the other hand, the horns are nearly as well developed in the female as in the male phanaeus lancifer; and only a little less well developed in the females of some other species of this genus and of copris. i am informed by mr. bates that the horns do not differ in any manner corresponding with the more important characteristic differences between the several subdivisions of the family: thus within the same section of the genus onthophagus, there are species which have a single horn, and others which have two. in almost all cases, the horns are remarkable from their excessive variability; so that a graduated series can be formed, from the most highly developed males to others so degenerate that they can barely be distinguished from the females. mr. walsh (64. 'proceedings of the entomological society of philadephia,' 1864, p. 228.) found that in phanaeus carnifex the horns were thrice as long in some males as in others. mr. bates, after examining above a hundred males of onthophagus rangifer (fig. 20), thought that he had at last discovered a species in which the horns did not vary; but further research proved the contrary. the extraordinary size of the horns, and their widely different structure in closely-allied forms, indicate that they have been formed for some purpose; but their excessive variability in the males of the same species leads to the inference that this purpose cannot be of a definite nature. the horns do not shew marks of friction, as if used for any ordinary work. some authors suppose (65. kirby and spence, 'introduction to entomology,' vol. iii. p. 300.) that as the males wander about much more than the females, they require horns as a defence against their enemies; but as the horns are often blunt, they do not seem well adapted for defence. the most obvious conjecture is that they are used by the males for fighting together; but the males have never been observed to fight; nor could mr. bates, after a careful examination of numerous species, find any sufficient evidence, in their mutilated or broken condition, of their having been thus used. if the males had been habitual fighters, the size of their bodies would probably have been increased through sexual selection, so as to have exceeded that of the females; but mr. bates, after comparing the two sexes in above a hundred species of the copridae, did not find any marked difference in this respect amongst well-developed individuals. in lethrus, moreover, a beetle belonging to the same great division of the lamellicorns, the males are known to fight, but are not provided with horns, though their mandibles are much larger than those of the female. the conclusion that the horns have been acquired as ornaments is that which best agrees with the fact of their having been so immensely, yet not fixedly, developed,--as shewn by their extreme variability in the same species, and by their extreme diversity in closely-allied species. this view will at first appear extremely improbable; but we shall hereafter find with many animals standing much higher in the scale, namely fishes, amphibians, reptiles and birds, that various kinds of crests, knobs, horns and combs have been developed apparently for this sole purpose. [fig.21. onitis furcifer, male viewed from beneath. fig.22. onitis furcifer. left-hand figure, male, viewed laterally. right-hand figure, female. a. rudiment of cephalic horn. b. trace of thoracic horn or crest.] the males of onitis furcifer (fig. 21), and of some other species of the genus, are furnished with singular projections on their anterior femora, and with a great fork or pair of horns on the lower surface of the thorax. judging from other insects, these may aid the male in clinging to the female. although the males have not even a trace of a horn on the upper surface of the body, yet the females plainly exhibit a rudiment of a single horn on the head (fig. 22, a), and of a crest (b) on the thorax. that the slight thoracic crest in the female is a rudiment of a projection proper to the male, though entirely absent in the male of this particular species, is clear: for the female of bubas bison (a genus which comes next to onitis) has a similar slight crest on the thorax, and the male bears a great projection in the same situation. so, again, there can hardly be a doubt that the little point (a) on the head of the female onitis furcifer, as well as on the head of the females of two or three allied species, is a rudimentary representative of the cephalic horn, which is common to the males of so many lamellicorn beetles, as in phanaeus (fig. 18). the old belief that rudiments have been created to complete the scheme of nature is here so far from holding good, that we have a complete inversion of the ordinary state of things in the family. we may reasonably suspect that the males originally bore horns and transferred them to the females in a rudimentary condition, as in so many other lamellicorns. why the males subsequently lost their horns, we know not; but this may have been caused through the principle of compensation, owing to the development of the large horns and projections on the lower surface; and as these are confined to the males, the rudiments of the upper horns on the females would not have been thus obliterated. [fig. 23. bledius taurus, magnified. left-hand figure, male; right-hand figure, female.] the cases hitherto given refer to the lamellicorns, but the males of some few other beetles, belonging to two widely distinct groups, namely, the curculionidae and staphylinidae, are furnished with horns--in the former on the lower surface of the body (66. kirby and spence, 'introduction to entomology,' vol. iii. p. 329.), in the latter on the upper surface of the head and thorax. in the staphylinidae, the horns of the males are extraordinarily variable in the same species, just as we have seen with the lamellicorns. in siagonium we have a case of dimorphism, for the males can be divided into two sets, differing greatly in the size of their bodies and in the development of their horns, without intermediate gradations. in a species of bledius (fig. 23), also belonging to the staphylinidae, professor westwood states that, "male specimens can be found in the same locality in which the central horn of the thorax is very large, but the horns of the head quite rudimental; and others, in which the thoracic horn is much shorter, whilst the protuberances on the head are long." (67. 'modern classification of insects,' vol. i. p. 172: siagonium, p. 172. in the british museum i noticed one male specimen of siagonium in an intermediate condition, so that the dimorphism is not strict.) here we apparently have a case of compensation, which throws light on that just given, of the supposed loss of the upper horns by the males of onitis. law of battle. some male beetles, which seem ill-fitted for fighting, nevertheless engage in conflicts for the possession of the females. mr. wallace (68. 'the malay archipelago,' vol. ii. 1869, p. 276. riley, sixth 'report on insects of missouri,' 1874, p. 115.) saw two males of leptorhynchus angustatus, a linear beetle with a much elongated rostrum, "fighting for a female, who stood close by busy at her boring. they pushed at each other with their rostra, and clawed and thumped, apparently in the greatest rage." the smaller male, however, "soon ran away, acknowledging himself vanquished." in some few cases male beetles are well adapted for fighting, by possessing great toothed mandibles, much larger than those of the females. this is the case with the common stag-beetle (lucanus cervus), the males of which emerge from the pupal state about a week before the other sex, so that several may often be seen pursuing the same female. at this season they engage in fierce conflicts. when mr. a.h. davis (69. 'entomological magazine,' vol. i. 1833, p. 82. see also on the conflicts of this species, kirby and spence, ibid. vol. iii. p. 314; and westwood, ibid. vol. i. p. 187.) enclosed two males with one female in a box, the larger male severely pinched the smaller one, until he resigned his pretensions. a friend informs me that when a boy he often put the males together to see them fight, and he noticed that they were much bolder and fiercer than the females, as with the higher animals. the males would seize hold of his finger, if held in front of them, but not so the females, although they have stronger jaws. the males of many of the lucanidae, as well as of the above-mentioned leptorhynchus, are larger and more powerful insects than the females. the two sexes of lethrus cephalotes (one of the lamellicorns) inhabit the same burrow; and the male has larger mandibles than the female. if, during the breeding-season, a strange male attempts to enter the burrow, he is attacked; the female does not remain passive, but closes the mouth of the burrow, and encourages her mate by continually pushing him on from behind; and the battle lasts until the aggressor is killed or runs away. (70. quoted from fischer, in 'dict. class. d'hist. nat.' tom. x. p. 324.) the two sexes of another lamellicorn beetle, the ateuchus cicatricosus, live in pairs, and seem much attached to each other; the male excites the females to roll the balls of dung in which the ova are deposited; and if she is removed, he becomes much agitated. if the male is removed the female ceases all work, and as m. brulerie believes, would remain on the same spot until she died. (71. 'ann. soc. entomolog. france,' 1866, as quoted in 'journal of travel,' by a. murray, 1868, p. 135.) [fig. 24. chiasognathus grantii, reduced. upper figure, male; lower figure, female.] the great mandibles of the male lucanidae are extremely variable both in size and structure, and in this respect resemble the horns on the head and thorax of many male lamellicorns and staphylinidae. a perfect series can be formed from the best-provided to the worst-provided or degenerate males. although the mandibles of the common stag-beetle, and probably of many other species, are used as efficient weapons for fighting, it is doubtful whether their great size can thus be accounted for. we have seen that they are used by the lucanus elaphus of n. america for seizing the female. as they are so conspicuous and so elegantly branched, and as owing to their great length they are not well adapted for pinching, the suspicion has crossed my mind that they may in addition serve as an ornament, like the horns on the head and thorax of the various species above described. the male chiasognathus grantii of s. chile--a splendid beetle belonging to the same family--has enormously developed mandibles (fig. 24); he is bold and pugnacious; when threatened he faces round, opens his great jaws, and at the same time stridulates loudly. but the mandibles were not strong enough to pinch my finger so as to cause actual pain. sexual selection, which implies the possession of considerable perceptive powers and of strong passions, seems to have been more effective with the lamellicorns than with any other family of beetles. with some species the males are provided with weapons for fighting; some live in pairs and shew mutual affection; many have the power of stridulating when excited; many are furnished with the most extraordinary horns, apparently for the sake of ornament; and some, which are diurnal in their habits, are gorgeously coloured. lastly, several of the largest beetles in the world belong to this family, which was placed by linnaeus and fabricius as the head of the order. (72. westwood, 'modern classification,' vol. i. p. 184.) stridulating organs. beetles belonging to many and widely distinct families possess these organs. the sound thus produced can sometimes be heard at the distance of several feet or even yards (73. wollaston, 'on certain musical curculionidae,' 'annals and mag. of nat. hist.' vol. vi. 1860, p. 14.), but it is not comparable with that made by the orthoptera. the rasp generally consists of a narrow, slightly-raised surface, crossed by very fine, parallel ribs, sometimes so fine as to cause iridescent colours, and having a very elegant appearance under the microscope. in some cases, as with typhoeus, minute, bristly or scale-like prominences, with which the whole surrounding surface is covered in approximately parallel lines, could be traced passing into the ribs of the rasp. the transition takes place by their becoming confluent and straight, and at the same time more prominent and smooth. a hard ridge on an adjoining part of the body serves as the scraper for the rasp, but this scraper in some cases has been specially modified for the purpose. it is rapidly moved across the rasp, or conversely the rasp across the scraper. [fig.25. necrophorus (from landois). r. the two rasps. left-hand figure, part of the rasp highly magnified.] these organs are situated in widely different positions. in the carrion- beetles (necrophorus) two parallel rasps (r, fig. 25) stand on the dorsal surface of the fifth abdominal segment, each rasp (74. landois, 'zeitschrift fur wissenschaft zoolog.' b. xvii. 1867, s. 127.) consisting of 126 to 140 fine ribs. these ribs are scraped against the posterior margins of the elytra, a small portion of which projects beyond the general outline. in many crioceridae, and in clythra 4-punctata (one of the chrysomelidae), and in some tenebrionidae, etc. (75. i am greatly indebted to mr. g.r. crotch for having sent me many prepared specimens of various beetles belonging to these three families and to others, as well as for valuable information. he believes that the power of stridulation in the clythra has not been previously observed. i am also much indebted to mr. e.w. janson, for information and specimens. i may add that my son, mr. f. darwin, finds that dermestes murinus stridulates, but he searched in vain for the apparatus. scolytus has lately been described by dr. chapman as a stridulator, in the 'entomologist's monthly magazine,' vol. vi. p. 130.), the rasp is seated on the dorsal apex of the abdomen, on the pygidium or pro-pygidium, and is scraped in the same manner by the elytra. in heterocerus, which belongs to another family, the rasps are placed on the sides of the first abdominal segment, and are scraped by ridges on the femora. (76. schiodte, translated, in 'annals and magazine of natural history,' vol. xx. 1867, p. 37.) in certain curculionidae and carabidae (77. westring has described (kroyer, 'naturhist. tidskrift,' b. ii. 1848- 49, p. 334) the stridulating organs in these two, as well as in other families. in the carabidae i have examined elaphrus uliginosus and blethisa multipunctata, sent to me by mr. crotch. in blethisa the transverse ridges on the furrowed border of the abdominal segment do not, as far as i could judge, come into play in scraping the rasps on the elytra.), the parts are completely reversed in position, for the rasps are seated on the inferior surface of the elytra, near their apices, or along their outer margins, and the edges of the abdominal segments serve as the scrapers. in pelobius hermanni (one of dytiscidae or water-beetles) a strong ridge runs parallel and near to the sutural margin of the elytra, and is crossed by ribs, coarse in the middle part, but becoming gradually finer at both ends, especially at the upper end; when this insect is held under water or in the air, a stridulating noise is produced by the extreme horny margin of the abdomen being scraped against the rasps. in a great number of long-horned beetles (longicornia) the organs are situated quite otherwise, the rasp being on the meso-thorax, which is rubbed against the pro-thorax; landois counted 238 very fine ribs on the rasp of cerambyx heros. [fig.26. hind-leg of geotrupes stercorarius (from landois). r. rasp. c. coxa. f. femur. t. tibia. tr. tarsi.] many lamellicorns have the power of stridulating, and the organs differ greatly in position. some species stridulate very loudly, so that when mr. f. smith caught a trox sabulosus, a gamekeeper, who stood by, thought he had caught a mouse; but i failed to discover the proper organs in this beetle. in geotrupes and typhoeus, a narrow ridge runs obliquely across (r, fig. 26) the coxa of each hind-leg (having in g. stercorarius 84 ribs), which is scraped by a specially projecting part of one of the abdominal segments. in the nearly allied copris lunaris, an excessively narrow fine rasp runs along the sutural margin of the elytra, with another short rasp near the basal outer margin; but in some other coprini the rasp is seated, according to leconte (78. i am indebted to mr. walsh, of illinois, for having sent me extracts from leconte's 'introduction to entomology,' pp. 101, 143.), on the dorsal surface of the abdomen. in oryctes it is seated on the pro-pygidium; and, according to the same entomologist, in some other dynastini, on the under surface of the elytra. lastly, westring states that in omaloplia brunnea the rasp is placed on the pro-sternum, and the scraper on the meta-sternum, the parts thus occupying the under surface of the body, instead of the upper surface as in the longicorns. we thus see that in the different coleopterous families the stridulating organs are wonderfully diversified in position, but not much in structure. within the same family some species are provided with these organs, and others are destitute of them. this diversity is intelligible, if we suppose that originally various beetles made a shuffling or hissing noise by the rubbing together of any hard and rough parts of their bodies, which happened to be in contact; and that from the noise thus produced being in some way useful, the rough surfaces were gradually developed into regular stridulating organs. some beetles as they move, now produce, either intentionally or unintentionally, a shuffling noise, without possessing any proper organs for the purpose. mr. wallace informs me that the euchirus longimanus (a lamellicorn, with the anterior legs wonderfully elongated in the male) "makes, whilst moving, a low hissing sound by the protrusion and contraction of the abdomen; and when seized it produces a grating sound by rubbing its hind-legs against the edges of the elytra." the hissing sound is clearly due to a narrow rasp running along the sutural margin of each elytron; and i could likewise make the grating sound by rubbing the shagreened surface of the femur against the granulated margin of the corresponding elytron; but i could not here detect any proper rasp; nor is it likely that i could have overlooked it in so large an insect. after examining cychrus, and reading what westring has written about this beetle, it seems very doubtful whether it possesses any true rasp, though it has the power of emitting a sound. from the analogy of the orthoptera and homoptera, i expected to find the stridulating organs in the coleoptera differing according to sex; but landois, who has carefully examined several species, observed no such difference; nor did westring; nor did mr. g.r. crotch in preparing the many specimens which he had the kindness to send me. any difference in these organs, if slight, would, however, be difficult to detect, on account of their great variability. thus, in the first pair of specimens of necrophorus humator and of pelobius which i examined, the rasp was considerably larger in the male than in the female; but not so with succeeding specimens. in geotrupes stercorarius the rasp appeared to me thicker, opaquer, and more prominent in three males than in the same number of females; in order, therefore, to discover whether the sexes differed in their power of stridulating, my son, mr. f. darwin, collected fifty-seven living specimens, which he separated into two lots, according as they made a greater or lesser noise, when held in the same manner. he then examined all these specimens, and found that the males were very nearly in the same proportion to the females in both the lots. mr. f. smith has kept alive numerous specimens of monoynchus pseudacori (curculionidae), and is convinced that both sexes stridulate, and apparently in an equal degree. nevertheless, the power of stridulating is certainly a sexual character in some few coleoptera. mr. crotch discovered that the males alone of two species of heliopathes (tenebrionidae) possess stridulating organs. i examined five males of h. gibbus, and in all these there was a well- developed rasp, partially divided into two, on the dorsal surface of the terminal abdominal segment; whilst in the same number of females there was not even a rudiment of the rasp, the membrane of this segment being transparent, and much thinner than in the male. in h. cribratostriatus the male has a similar rasp, excepting that it is not partially divided into two portions, and the female is completely destitute of this organ; the male in addition has on the apical margins of the elytra, on each side of the suture, three or four short longitudinal ridges, which are crossed by extremely fine ribs, parallel to and resembling those on the abdominal rasp; whether these ridges serve as an independent rasp, or as a scraper for the abdominal rasp, i could not decide: the female exhibits no trace of this latter structure. again, in three species of the lamellicorn genus oryctes, we have a nearly parallel case. in the females of o. gryphus and nasicornis the ribs on the rasp of the pro-pygidium are less continuous and less distinct than in the males; but the chief difference is that the whole upper surface of this segment, when held in the proper light, is seen to be clothed with hairs, which are absent or are represented by excessively fine down in the males. it should be noticed that in all coleoptera the effective part of the rasp is destitute of hairs. in o. senegalensis the difference between the sexes is more strongly marked, and this is best seen when the proper abdominal segment is cleaned and viewed as a transparent object. in the female the whole surface is covered with little separate crests, bearing spines; whilst in the male these crests in proceeding towards the apex, become more and more confluent, regular, and naked; so that three-fourths of the segment is covered with extremely fine parallel ribs, which are quite absent in the female. in the females, however, of all three species of oryctes, a slight grating or stridulating sound is produced, when the abdomen of a softened specimen is pushed backwards and forwards. in the case of the heliopathes and oryctes there can hardly be a doubt that the males stridulate in order to call or to excite the females; but with most beetles the stridulation apparently serves both sexes as a mutual call. beetles stridulate under various emotions, in the same manner as birds use their voices for many purposes besides singing to their mates. the great chiasognathus stridulates in anger or defiance; many species do the same from distress or fear, if held so that they cannot escape; by striking the hollow stems of trees in the canary islands, messrs. wollaston and crotch were able to discover the presence of beetles belonging to the genus acalles by their stridulation. lastly, the male ateuchus stridulates to encourage the female in her work, and from distress when she is removed. (79. m. p. de la brulerie, as quoted in 'journal of travel,' a. murray, vol. i. 1868, p. 135.) some naturalists believe that beetles make this noise to frighten away their enemies; but i cannot think that a quadruped or bird, able to devour a large beetle, would be frightened by so slight a sound. the belief that the stridulation serves as a sexual call is supported by the fact that death-ticks (anobium tessellatum) are well known to answer each other's ticking, and, as i have myself observed, a tapping noise artificially made. mr. doubleday also informs me that he has sometimes observed a female ticking (80. according to mr. doubleday, "the noise is produced by the insect raising itself on its legs as high as it can, and then striking its thorax five or six times, in rapid succession, against the substance upon which it is sitting." for references on this subject see landois, 'zeitschrift für wissen. zoolog.' b. xvii. s. 131. olivier says (as quoted by kirby and spence, 'introduction to entomology,' vol. ii. p. 395) that the female of pimelia striata produces a rather loud sound by striking her abdomen against any hard substance, "and that the male, obedient to this call, soon attends her, and they pair."), and in an hour or two afterwards has found her united with a male, and on one occasion surrounded by several males. finally, it is probable that the two sexes of many kinds of beetles were at first enabled to find each other by the slight shuffling noise produced by the rubbing together of the adjoining hard parts of their bodies; and that as those males or females which made the greatest noise succeeded best in finding partners, rugosities on various parts of their bodies were gradually developed by means of sexual selection into true stridulating organs. chapter xi. insects, continued. order lepidoptera.

(2. see my 'journal of researches,' 1845, p. 33. mr. doubleday has detected ('proc. ent. soc.' march 3, 1845, p. 123) a peculiar membranous sac at the base of the front wings, which is probably connected with the production of the sound. for the case of thecophora, see 'zoological record,' 1869, p. 401. for mr. buchanan white's observations, the scottish naturalist, july 1872, p. 214.) some moths also produce sounds; for instance, the males theocophora fovea. on two occasions mr. f. buchanan white (3. 'the scottish naturalist,' july 1872, p. 213.) heard a sharp quick noise made by the male of hylophila prasinana, and which he believes to be produced, as in cicada, by an elastic membrane, furnished with a muscle. he quotes, also, guenee, that setina produces a sound like the ticking of a watch, apparently by the aid of "two large tympaniform vesicles, situated in the pectoral region"; and these "are much more developed in the male than in the female." hence the sound-producing organs in the lepidoptera appear to stand in some relation with the sexual functions. i have not alluded to the well-known noise made by the death's head sphinx, for it is generally heard soon after the moth has emerged from its cocoon. giard has always observed that the musky odour, which is emitted by two species of sphinx moths, is peculiar to the males (4. 'zoological record,' 1869, p. 347.); and in the higher classes we shall meet with many instances of the males alone being odoriferous. every one must have admired the extreme beauty of many butterflies and of some moths; and it may be asked, are their colours and diversified patterns the result of the direct action of the physical conditions to which these insects have been exposed, without any benefit being thus derived? or have successive variations been accumulated and determined as a protection, or for some unknown purpose, or that one sex may be attractive to the other? and, again, what is the meaning of the colours being widely different in the males and females of certain species, and alike in the two sexes of other species of the same genus? before attempting to answer these questions a body of facts must be given. with our beautiful english butterflies, the admiral, peacock, and painted lady (vanessae), as well as many others, the sexes are alike. this is also the case with the magnificent heliconidae, and most of the danaidae in the tropics. but in certain other tropical groups, and in some of our english butterflies, as the purple emperor, orange-tip, etc. (apatura iris and anthocharis cardamines), the sexes differ either greatly or slightly in colour. no language suffices to describe the splendour of the males of some tropical species. even within the same genus we often find species presenting extraordinary differences between the sexes, whilst others have their sexes closely alike. thus in the south american genus epicalia, mr. bates, to whom i am indebted for most of the following facts, and for looking over this whole discussion, informs me that he knows twelve species, the two sexes of which haunt the same stations (and this is not always the case with butterflies), and which, therefore, cannot have been differently affected by external conditions. (5. see also mr. bates's paper in 'proc. ent. soc. of philadelphia,' 1865, p. 206. also mr. wallace on the same subject, in regard to diadema, in 'transactions, entomological society of london,' 1869, p. 278.) in nine of these twelve species the males rank amongst the most brilliant of all butterflies, and differ so greatly from the comparatively plain females that they were formerly placed in distinct genera. the females of these nine species resemble each other in their general type of coloration; and they likewise resemble both sexes of the species in several allied genera found in various parts of the world. hence we may infer that these nine species, and probably all the others of the genus, are descended from an ancestral form which was coloured in nearly the same manner. in the tenth species the female still retains the same general colouring, but the male resembles her, so that he is coloured in a much less gaudy and contrasted manner than the males of the previous species. in the eleventh and twelfth species, the females depart from the usual type, for they are gaily decorated almost like the males, but in a somewhat less degree. hence in these two latter species the bright colours of the males seem to have been transferred to the females; whilst in the tenth species the male has either retained or recovered the plain colours of the female, as well as of the parent-form of the genus. the sexes in these three cases have thus been rendered nearly alike, though in an opposite manner. in the allied genus eubagis, both sexes of some of the species are plain-coloured and nearly alike; whilst with the greater number the males are decorated with beautiful metallic tints in a diversified manner, and differ much from their females. the females throughout the genus retain the same general style of colouring, so that they resemble one another much more closely than they resemble their own males. in the genus papilio, all the species of the aeneas group are remarkable for their conspicuous and strongly contrasted colours, and they illustrate the frequent tendency to gradation in the amount of difference between the sexes. in a few species, for instance in p. ascanius, the males and females are alike; in others the males are either a little brighter, or very much more superb than the females. the genus junonia, allied to our vanessae, offers a nearly parallel case, for although the sexes of most of the species resemble each other, and are destitute of rich colours, yet in certain species, as in j. oenone, the male is rather more bright-coloured than the female, and in a few (for instance j. andremiaja) the male is so different from the female that he might be mistaken for an entirely distinct species. another striking case was pointed out to me in the british museum by mr. a. butler, namely, one of the tropical american theclae, in which both sexes are nearly alike and wonderfully splendid; in another species the male is coloured in a similarly gorgeous manner, whilst the whole upper surface of the female is of a dull uniform brown. our common little english blue butterflies of the genus lycaena, illustrate the various differences in colour between the sexes, almost as well, though not in so striking a manner, as the above exotic genera. in lycaena agestis both sexes have wings of a brown colour, bordered with small ocellated orange spots, and are thus alike. in l. oegon the wings of the males are of a fine blue, bordered with black, whilst those of the female are brown, with a similar border, closely resembling the wings of l. agestis. lastly, in l. arion both sexes are of a blue colour and are very like, though in the female the edges of the wings are rather duskier, with the black spots plainer; and in a bright blue indian species both sexes are still more alike. i have given the foregoing details in order to shew, in the first place, that when the sexes of butterflies differ, the male as a general rule is the more beautiful, and departs more from the usual type of colouring of the group to which the species belongs. hence in most groups the females of the several species resemble each other much more closely than do the males. in some cases, however, to which i shall hereafter allude, the females are coloured more splendidly than the males. in the second place, these details have been given to bring clearly before the mind that within the same genus, the two sexes frequently present every gradation from no difference in colour, to so great a difference that it was long before the two were placed by entomologists in the same genus. in the third place, we have seen that when the sexes nearly resemble each other, this appears due either to the male having transferred his colours to the female, or to the male having retained, or perhaps recovered, the primordial colours of the group. it also deserves notice that in those groups in which the sexes differ, the females usually somewhat resemble the males, so that when the males are beautiful to an extraordinary degree, the females almost invariably exhibit some degree of beauty. from the many cases of gradation in the amount of difference between the sexes, and from the prevalence of the same general type of coloration throughout the whole of the same group, we may conclude that the causes have generally been the same which have determined the brilliant colouring of the males alone of some species, and of both sexes of other species. as so many gorgeous butterflies inhabit the tropics, it has often been supposed that they owe their colours to the great heat and moisture of these zones; but mr. bates (6. 'the naturalist on the amazons,' vol. i. 1863, p. 19.) has shown by the comparison of various closely-allied groups of insects from the temperate and tropical regions, that this view cannot be maintained; and the evidence becomes conclusive when brilliantly- coloured males and plain-coloured females of the same species inhabit the same district, feed on the same food, and follow exactly the same habits of life. even when the sexes resemble each other, we can hardly believe that their brilliant and beautifully-arranged colours are the purposeless result of the nature of the tissues and of the action of the surrounding conditions. with animals of all kinds, whenever colour has been modified for some special purpose, this has been, as far as we can judge, either for direct or indirect protection, or as an attraction between the sexes. with many species of butterflies the upper surfaces of the wings are obscure; and this in all probability leads to their escaping observation and danger. but butterflies would be particularly liable to be attacked by their enemies when at rest; and most kinds whilst resting raise their wings vertically over their backs, so that the lower surface alone is exposed to view. hence it is this side which is often coloured so as to imitate the objects on which these insects commonly rest. dr. rossler, i believe, first noticed the similarity of the closed wings of certain vanessae and other butterflies to the bark of trees. many analogous and striking facts could be given. the most interesting one is that recorded by mr. wallace (7. see the interesting article in the 'westminster review,' july 1867, p. 10. a woodcut of the kallima is given by mr. wallace in 'hardwicke's science gossip,' september 1867, p. 196.) of a common indian and sumatran butterfly (kallima) which disappears like magic when it settles on a bush; for it hides its head and antennae between its closed wings, which, in form, colour and veining, cannot be distinguished from a withered leaf with its footstalk. in some other cases the lower surfaces of the wings are brilliantly coloured, and yet are protective; thus in thecla rubi the wings when closed are of an emerald green, and resemble the young leaves of the bramble, on which in spring this butterfly may often be seen seated. it is also remarkable that in very many species in which the sexes differ greatly in colour on their upper surface, the lower surface is closely similar or identical in both sexes, and serves as a protection. (8. mr. g. fraser, in 'nature,' april 1871, p. 489.) although the obscure tints both of the upper and under sides of many butterflies no doubt serve to conceal them, yet we cannot extend this view to the brilliant and conspicuous colours on the upper surface of such species as our admiral and peacock vanessae, our white cabbage-butterflies (pieris), or the great swallow-tail papilio which haunts the open fens--for these butterflies are thus rendered visible to every living creature. in these species both sexes are alike; but in the common brimstone butterfly (gonepteryx rhamni), the male is of an intense yellow, whilst the female is much paler; and in the orange-tip (anthocharis cardamines) the males alone have their wings tipped with bright orange. both the males and females in these cases are conspicuous, and it is not credible that their difference in colour should stand in any relation to ordinary protection. prof. weismann remarks (9. 'einfluss der isolirung auf die artbildung,' 1872, p. 58.), that the female of one of the lycaenae expands her brown wings when she settles on the ground, and is then almost invisible; the male, on the other hand, as if aware of the danger incurred from the bright blue of the upper surface of his wings, rests with them closed; and this shows that the blue colour cannot be in any way protective. nevertheless, it is probable that conspicuous colours are indirectly beneficial to many species, as a warning that they are unpalatable. for in certain other cases, beauty has been gained through the imitation of other beautiful species, which inhabit the same district and enjoy an immunity from attack by being in some way offensive to their enemies; but then we have to account for the beauty of the imitated species. as mr. walsh has remarked to me, the females of our orange-tip butterfly, above referred to, and of an american species (anth. genutia) probably shew us the primordial colours of the parent-species of the genus; for both sexes of four or five widely-distributed species are coloured in nearly the same manner. as in several previous cases, we may here infer that it is the males of anth. cardamines and genutia which have departed from the usual type of the genus. in the anth. sara from california, the orange- tips to the wings have been partially developed in the female; but they are paler than in the male, and slightly different in some other respects. in an allied indian form, the iphias glaucippe, the orange-tips are fully developed in both sexes. in this iphias, as pointed out to me by mr. a. butler, the under surface of the wings marvellously resembles a pale- coloured leaf; and in our english orange-tip, the under surface resembles the flower-head of the wild parsley, on which the butterfly often rests at night. (10. see the interesting observations by t.w. wood, 'the student,' sept. 1868, p. 81.) the same reason which compels us to believe that the lower surfaces have here been coloured for the sake of protection, leads us to deny that the wings have been tipped with bright orange for the same purpose, especially when this character is confined to the males. most moths rest motionless during the whole or greater part of the day with their wings depressed; and the whole upper surface is often shaded and coloured in an admirable manner, as mr. wallace has remarked, for escaping detection. the front-wings of the bombycidae and noctuidae (11. mr. wallace in 'hardwicke's science gossip,' september 1867, p. 193.), when at rest, generally overlap and conceal the hind-wings; so that the latter might be brightly coloured without much risk; and they are in fact often thus coloured. during flight, moths would often be able to escape from their enemies; nevertheless, as the hind-wings are then fully exposed to view, their bright colours must generally have been acquired at some little risk. but the following fact shews how cautious we ought to be in drawing conclusions on this head. the common yellow under-wings (triphaena) often fly about during the day or early evening, and are then conspicuous from the colour of their hind-wings. it would naturally be thought that this would be a source of danger; but mr. j. jenner weir believes that it actually serves them as a means of escape, for birds strike at these brightly coloured and fragile surfaces, instead of at the body. for instance, mr. weir turned into his aviary a vigorous specimen of triphaena pronuba, which was instantly pursued by a robin; but the bird's attention being caught by the coloured wings, the moth was not captured until after about fifty attempts, and small portions of the wings were repeatedly broken off. he tried the same experiment, in the open air, with a swallow and t. fimbria; but the large size of this moth probably interfered with its capture. (12. see also, on this subject, mr. weir's paper in 'transactions, entomological society,' 1869, p. 23.) we are thus reminded of a statement made by mr. wallace (13. 'westminster review,' july 1867, p. 16.), namely, that in the brazilian forests and malayan islands, many common and highly-decorated butterflies are weak flyers, though furnished with a broad expanse of wing; and they "are often captured with pierced and broken wings, as if they had been seized by birds, from which they had escaped: if the wings had been much smaller in proportion to the body, it seems probable that the insect would more frequently have been struck or pierced in a vital part, and thus the increased expanse of the wings may have been indirectly beneficial." display. the bright colours of many butterflies and of some moths are specially arranged for display, so that they may be readily seen. during the night colours are not visible, and there can be no doubt that the nocturnal moths, taken as a body, are much less gaily decorated than butterflies, all of which are diurnal in their habits. but the moths of certain families, such as the zygaenidae, several sphingidae, uraniidae, some arctiidae and saturniidae, fly about during the day or early evening, and many of these are extremely beautiful, being far brighter coloured than the strictly nocturnal kinds. a few exceptional cases, however, of bright-coloured nocturnal species have been recorded. (14. for instance, lithosia; but prof. westwood ('modern class. of insects,' vol. ii. p. 390) seems surprised at this case. on the relative colours of diurnal and nocturnal lepidoptera, see ibid. pp. 333 and 392; also harris, 'treatise on the insects of new england,' 1842, p. 315.) there is evidence of another kind in regard to display. butterflies, as before remarked, elevate their wings when at rest, but whilst basking in the sunshine often alternately raise and depress them, thus exposing both surfaces to full view; and although the lower surface is often coloured in an obscure manner as a protection, yet in many species it is as highly decorated as the upper surface, and sometimes in a very different manner. in some tropical species the lower surface is even more brilliantly coloured than the upper. (15. such differences between the upper and lower surfaces of the wings of several species of papilio may be seen in the beautiful plates to mr. wallace's 'memoir on the papilionidae of the malayan region,' in 'transactions of the linnean society,' vol. xxv. part i. 1865.) in the english fritillaries (argynnis) the lower surface alone is ornamented with shining silver. nevertheless, as a general rule, the upper surface, which is probably more fully exposed, is coloured more brightly and diversely than the lower. hence the lower surface generally affords to entomologists the more useful character for detecting the affinities of the various species. fritz müller informs me that three species of castnia are found near his house in s. brazil: of two of them the hind-wings are obscure, and are always covered by the front-wings when these butterflies are at rest; but the third species has black hind-wings, beautifully spotted with red and white, and these are fully expanded and displayed whenever the butterfly rests. other such cases could be added. if we now turn to the enormous group of moths, which, as i hear from mr. stainton, do not habitually expose the under surface of their wings to full view, we find this side very rarely coloured with a brightness greater than, or even equal to, that of the upper side. some exceptions to the rule, either real or apparent, must be noticed, as the case of hypopyra. (16. see mr. wormald on this moth: 'proceedings of the entomological society,' march 2, 1868.) mr. trimen informs me that in guenee's great work, three moths are figured, in which the under surface is much the more brilliant. for instance, in the australian gastrophora the upper surface of the fore-wing is pale greyish-ochreous, while the lower surface is magnificently ornamented by an ocellus of cobalt-blue, placed in the midst of a black mark, surrounded by orange-yellow, and this by bluish-white. but the habits of these three moths are unknown; so that no explanation can be given of their unusual style of colouring. mr. trimen also informs me that the lower surface of the wings in certain other geometrae (17. see also an account of the s. american genus erateina (one of the geometrae) in 'transactions, ent. soc.' new series, vol. v. pl. xv. and xvi.) and quadrifid noctuae are either more variegated or more brightly-coloured than the upper surface; but some of these species have the habit of "holding their wings quite erect over their backs, retaining them in this position for a considerable time," and thus exposing the under surface to view. other species, when settled on the ground or herbage, now and then suddenly and slightly lift up their wings. hence the lower surface of the wings being brighter than the upper surface in certain moths is not so anomalous as it at first appears. the saturniidae include some of the most beautiful of all moths, their wings being decorated, as in our british emperor moth, with fine ocelli; and mr. t.w. wood (18. 'proc ent. soc. of london,' july 6, 1868, p. xxvii.) observes that they resemble butterflies in some of their movements; "for instance, in the gentle waving up and down of the wings as if for display, which is more characteristic of diurnal than of nocturnal lepidoptera." it is a singular fact that no british moths which are brilliantly coloured, and, as far as i can discover, hardly any foreign species, differ much in colour according to sex; though this is the case with many brilliant butterflies. the male, however, of one american moth, the saturnia io, is described as having its fore-wings deep yellow, curiously marked with purplish-red spots; whilst the wings of the female are purple-brown, marked with grey lines. (19. harris, 'treatise,' etc., edited by flint, 1862, p. 395.) the british moths which differ sexually in colour are all brown, or of various dull yellow tints, or nearly white. in several species the males are much darker than the females (20. for instance, i observe in my son's cabinet that the males are darker than the females in the lasiocampa quercus, odonestis potatoria, hypogymna dispar, dasychira pudibunda, and cycnia mendica. in this latter species the difference in colour between the two sexes is strongly marked; and mr. wallace informs me that we here have, as he believes, an instance of protective mimicry confined to one sex, as will hereafter be more fully explained. the white female of the cycnia resembles the very common spilosoma menthrasti, both sexes of which are white; and mr. stainton observed that this latter moth was rejected with utter disgust by a whole brood of young turkeys, which were fond of eating other moths; so that if the cycnia was commonly mistaken by british birds for the spilosoma, it would escape being devoured, and its white deceptive colour would thus be highly beneficial.), and these belong to groups which generally fly about during the afternoon. on the other hand, in many genera, as mr. stainton informs me, the males have the hind-wings whiter than those of the female--of which fact agrotis exclamationis offers a good instance. in the ghost moth (hepialus humuli) the difference is more strongly marked; the males being white, and the females yellow with darker markings. (21. it is remarkable, that in the shetland islands the male of this moth, instead of differing widely from the female, frequently resembles her closely in colour (see mr. maclachlan, 'transactions, entomological society,' vol. ii. 1866, p. 459). mr. g. fraser suggests ('nature,' april 1871, p. 489) that at the season of the year when the ghost-moth appears in these northern islands, the whiteness of the males would not be needed to render them visible to the females in the twilight night.) it is probable that in these cases the males are thus rendered more conspicuous, and more easily seen by the females whilst flying about in the dusk. from the several foregoing facts it is impossible to admit that the brilliant colours of butterflies, and of some few moths, have commonly been acquired for the sake of protection. we have seen that their colours and elegant patterns are arranged and exhibited as if for display. hence i am led to believe that the females prefer or are most excited by the more brilliant males; for on any other supposition the males would, as far as we can see, be ornamented to no purpose. we know that ants and certain lamellicorn beetles are capable of feeling an attachment for each other, and that ants recognise their fellows after an interval of several months. hence there is no abstract improbability in the lepidoptera, which probably stand nearly or quite as high in the scale as these insects, having sufficient mental capacity to admire bright colours. they certainly discover flowers by colour. the humming-bird sphinx may often be seen to swoop down from a distance on a bunch of flowers in the midst of green foliage; and i have been assured by two persons abroad, that these moths repeatedly visit flowers painted on the walls of a room, and vainly endeavour to insert their proboscis into them. fritz müller informs me that several kinds of butterflies in s. brazil shew an unmistakable preference for certain colours over others: he observed that they very often visited the brilliant red flowers of five or six genera of plants, but never the white or yellow flowering species of the same and other genera, growing in the same garden; and i have received other accounts to the same effect. as i hear from mr. doubleday, the common white butterfly often flies down to a bit of paper on the ground, no doubt mistaking it for one of its own species. mr. collingwood (22. 'rambles of a naturalist in the chinese seas,' 1868, p. 182.) in speaking of the difficulty in collecting certain butterflies in the malay archipelago, states that "a dead specimen pinned upon a conspicuous twig will often arrest an insect of the same species in its headlong flight, and bring it down within easy reach of the net, especially if it be of the opposite sex." the courtship of butterflies is, as before remarked, a prolonged affair. the males sometimes fight together in rivalry; and many may be seen pursuing or crowding round the same female. unless, then, the females prefer one male to another, the pairing must be left to mere chance, and this does not appear probable. if, on the other band, the females habitually, or even occasionally, prefer the more beautiful males, the colours of the latter will have been rendered brighter by degrees, and will have been transmitted to both sexes or to one sex, according to the law of inheritance which has prevailed. the process of sexual selection will have been much facilitated, if the conclusion can be trusted, arrived at from various kinds of evidence in the supplement to the ninth chapter; namely, that the males of many lepidoptera, at least in the imago state, greatly exceed the females in number. some facts, however, are opposed to the belief that female butterflies prefer the more beautiful males; thus, as i have been assured by several collectors, fresh females may frequently be seen paired with battered, faded, or dingy males; but this is a circumstance which could hardly fail often to follow from the males emerging from their cocoons earlier than the females. with moths of the family of the bombycidae, the sexes pair immediately after assuming the imago state; for they cannot feed, owing to the rudimentary condition of their mouths. the females, as several entomologists have remarked to me, lie in an almost torpid state, and appear not to evince the least choice in regard to their partners. this is the case with the common silk-moth (b. mori), as i have been told by some continental and english breeders. dr. wallace, who has had great experience in breeding bombyx cynthia, is convinced that the females evince no choice or preference. he has kept above 300 of these moths together, and has often found the most vigorous females mated with stunted males. the reverse appears to occur seldom; for, as he believes, the more vigorous males pass over the weakly females, and are attracted by those endowed with most vitality. nevertheless, the bombycidae, though obscurely-coloured, are often beautiful to our eyes from their elegant and mottled shades. i have as yet only referred to the species in which the males are brighter coloured than the females, and i have attributed their beauty to the females for many generations having chosen and paired with the more attractive males. but converse cases occur, though rarely, in which the females are more brilliant than the males; and here, as i believe, the males have selected the more beautiful females, and have thus slowly added to their beauty. we do not know why in various classes of animals the males of some few species have selected the more beautiful females instead of having gladly accepted any female, as seems to be the general rule in the animal kingdom: but if, contrary to what generally occurs with the lepidoptera, the females were much more numerous than the males, the latter would be likely to pick out the more beautiful females. mr. butler shewed me several species of callidryas in the british museum, in some of which the females equalled, and in others greatly surpassed the males in beauty; for the females alone have the borders of their wings suffused with crimson and orange, and spotted with black. the plainer males of these species closely resemble each other, shewing that here the females have been modified; whereas in those cases, where the males are the more ornate, it is these which have been modified, the females remaining closely alike. in england we have some analogous cases, though not so marked. the females alone of two species of thecla have a bright-purple or orange patch on their fore-wings. in hipparchia the sexes do not differ much; but it is the female of h. janira which has a conspicuous light-brown patch on her wings; and the females of some of the other species are brighter coloured than their males. again, the females of colias edusa and hyale have "orange or yellow spots on the black marginal border, represented in the males only by thin streaks"; and in pieris it is the females which "are ornamented with black spots on the fore-wings, and these are only partially present in the males." now the males of many butterflies are known to support the females during their marriage flight; but in the species just named it is the females which support the males; so that the part which the two sexes play is reversed, as is their relative beauty. throughout the animal kingdom the males commonly take the more active share in wooing, and their beauty seems to have been increased by the females having accepted the more attractive individuals; but with these butterflies, the females take the more active part in the final marriage ceremony, so that we may suppose that they likewise do so in the wooing; and in this case we can understand how it is that they have been rendered the more beautiful. mr. meldola, from whom the foregoing statements have been taken, says in conclusion: "though i am not convinced of the action of sexual selection in producing the colours of insects, it cannot be denied that these facts are strikingly corroborative of mr. darwin's views." (23. 'nature,' april 27, 1871, p. 508. mr. meldola quotes donzel, in 'soc. ent. de france,' 1837, p. 77, on the flight of butterflies whilst pairing. see also mr. g. fraser, in 'nature,' april 20, 1871, p. 489, on the sexual differences of several british butterflies.) as sexual selection primarily depends on variability, a few words must be added on this subject. in respect to colour there is no difficulty, for any number of highly variable lepidoptera could be named. one good instance will suffice. mr. bates shewed me a whole series of specimens of papilio sesostris and p. childrenae; in the latter the males varied much in the extent of the beautifully enamelled green patch on the fore-wings, and in the size of the white mark, and of the splendid crimson stripe on the hind-wings; so that there was a great contrast amongst the males between the most and the least gaudy. the male of papilio sesostris is much less beautiful than of p. childrenae; and it likewise varies a little in the size of the green patch on the fore-wings, and in the occasional appearance of the small crimson stripe on the hind-wings, borrowed, as it would seem, from its own female; for the females of this and of many other species in the aeneas group possess this crimson stripe. hence between the brightest specimens of p. sesostris and the dullest of p. childrenae, there was but a small interval; and it was evident that as far as mere variability is concerned, there would be no difficulty in permanently increasing the beauty of either species by means of selection. the variability is here almost confined to the male sex; but mr. wallace and mr. bates have shewn (24. wallace on the papilionidae of the malayan region, in 'transact. linn. soc.' vol. xxv. 1865, pp. 8, 36. a striking case of a rare variety, strictly intermediate between two other well-marked female varieties, is given by mr. wallace. see also mr. bates, in 'proc. entomolog. soc.' nov. 19, 1866, p. xl.) that the females of some species are extremely variable, the males being nearly constant. in a future chapter i shall have occasion to shew that the beautiful eye-like spots, or ocelli, found on the wings of many lepidoptera, are eminently variable. i may here add that these ocelli offer a difficulty on the theory of sexual selection; for though appearing to us so ornamental, they are never present in one sex and absent in the other, nor do they ever differ much in the two sexes. (25. mr. bates was so kind as to lay this subject before the entomological society, and i have received answers to this effect from several entomologists.) this fact is at present inexplicable; but if it should hereafter be found that the formation of an ocellus is due to some change in the tissues of the wings, for instance, occurring at a very early period of development, we might expect, from what we know of the laws of inheritance, that it would be transmitted to both sexes, though arising and perfected in one sex alone. on the whole, although many serious objections may be urged, it seems probable that most of the brilliantly-coloured species of lepidoptera owe their colours to sexual selection, excepting in certain cases, presently to be mentioned, in which conspicuous colours have been gained through mimicry as a protection. from the ardour of the male throughout the animal kingdom, he is generally willing to accept any female; and it is the female which usually exerts a choice. hence, if sexual selection has been efficient with the lepidoptera, the male, when the sexes differ, ought to be the more brilliantly coloured, and this undoubtedly is the case. when both sexes are brilliantly coloured and resemble each other, the characters acquired by the males appear to have been transmitted to both. we are led to this conclusion by cases, even within the same genus, of gradation from an extraordinary amount of difference to identity in colour between the two sexes. but it may be asked whether the difference in colour between the sexes may not be accounted for by other means besides sexual selection. thus the males and females of the same species of butterfly are in several cases known (26. h.w. bates, 'the naturalist on the amazons,' vol. ii. 1863, p. 228. a.r. wallace, in 'transactions, linnean society,' vol. xxv. 1865, p. 10.) to inhabit different stations, the former commonly basking in the sunshine, the latter haunting gloomy forests. it is therefore possible that different conditions of life may have acted directly on the two sexes; but this is not probable (27. on this whole subject see 'the variation of animals and plants under domestication,' 1868, vol. ii. chap. xxiii.) as in the adult state they are exposed to different conditions during a very short period; and the larvae of both are exposed to the same conditions. mr. wallace believes that the difference between the sexes is due not so much to the males having been modified, as to the females having in all or almost all cases acquired dull colours for the sake of protection. it seems to me, on the contrary, far more probable that it is the males which have been chiefly modified through sexual selection, the females having been comparatively little changed. we can thus understand how it is that the females of allied species generally resemble one another so much more closely than do the males. they thus shew us approximately the primordial colouring of the parent-species of the group to which they belong. they have, however, almost always been somewhat modified by the transfer to them of some of the successive variations, through the accumulation of which the males were rendered beautiful. but i do not wish to deny that the females alone of some species may have been specially modified for protection. in most cases the males and females of distinct species will have been exposed during their prolonged larval state to different conditions, and may have been thus affected; though with the males any slight change of colour thus caused will generally have been masked by the brilliant tints gained through sexual selection. when we treat of birds, i shall have to discuss the whole question, as to how far the differences in colour between the sexes are due to the males having been modified through sexual selection for ornamental purposes, or to the females having been modified through natural selection for the sake of protection, so that i will here say but little on the subject. in all the cases in which the more common form of equal inheritance by both sexes has prevailed, the selection of bright-coloured males would tend to make the females bright-coloured; and the selection of dull-coloured females would tend to make the males dull. if both processes were carried on simultaneously, they would tend to counteract each other; and the final result would depend on whether a greater number of females from being well protected by obscure colours, or a greater number of males by being brightly-coloured and thus finding partners, succeeded in leaving more numerous offspring. in order to account for the frequent transmission of characters to one sex alone, mr. wallace expresses his belief that the more common form of equal inheritance by both sexes can be changed through natural selection into inheritance by one sex alone, but in favour of this view i can discover no evidence. we know from what occurs under domestication that new characters often appear, which from the first are transmitted to one sex alone; and by the selection of such variations there would not be the slightest difficulty in giving bright colours to the males alone, and at the same time or subsequently, dull colours to the females alone. in this manner the females of some butterflies and moths have, it is probable, been rendered inconspicuous for the sake of protection, and widely different from their males. i am, however, unwilling without distinct evidence to admit that two complex processes of selection, each requiring the transference of new characters to one sex alone, have been carried on with a multitude of species,--that the males have been rendered more brilliant by beating their rivals, and the females more dull-coloured by having escaped from their enemies. the male, for instance, of the common brimstone butterfly (gonepteryx), is of a far more intense yellow than the female, though she is equally conspicuous; and it does not seem probable that she specially acquired her pale tints as a protection, though it is probable that the male acquired his bright colours as a sexual attraction. the female of anthocharis cardamines does not possess the beautiful orange wing-tips of the male; consequently she closely resembles the white butterflies (pieris) so common in our gardens; but we have no evidence that this resemblance is beneficial to her. as, on the other hand, she resembles both sexes of several other species of the genus inhabiting various quarters of the world, it is probable that she has simply retained to a large extent her primordial colours. finally, as we have seen, various considerations lead to the conclusion that with the greater number of brilliantly-coloured lepidoptera it is the male which has been chiefly modified through sexual selection; the amount of difference between the sexes mostly depending on the form of inheritance which has prevailed. inheritance is governed by so many unknown laws or conditions, that it seems to us to act in a capricious manner (28. the 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. chap. xii. p. 17.); and we can thus, to a certain extent, understand how it is that with closely allied species the sexes either differ to an astonishing degree, or are identical in colour. as all the successive steps in the process of variation are necessarily transmitted through the female, a greater or less number of such steps might readily become developed in her; and thus we can understand the frequent gradations from an extreme difference to none at all between the sexes of allied species. these cases of gradation, it may be added, are much too common to favour the supposition that we here see females actually undergoing the process of transition and losing their brightness for the sake of protection; for we have every reason to conclude that at any one time the greater number of species are in a fixed condition. mimicry. this principle was first made clear in an admirable paper by mr. bates (29. 'transact. linn. soc.' vol. xxiii. 1862, p. 495.), who thus threw a flood of light on many obscure problems. it had previously been observed that certain butterflies in s. america belonging to quite distinct families, resembled the heliconidae so closely in every stripe and shade of colour, that they could not be distinguished save by an experienced entomologist. as the heliconidae are coloured in their usual manner, whilst the others depart from the usual colouring of the groups to which they belong, it is clear that the latter are the imitators, and the heliconidae the imitated. mr. bates further observed that the imitating species are comparatively rare, whilst the imitated abound, and that the two sets live mingled together. from the fact of the heliconidae being conspicuous and beautiful insects, yet so numerous in individuals and species, he concluded that they must be protected from the attacks of enemies by some secretion or odour; and this conclusion has now been amply confirmed (30. 'proc. entomological soc.' dec. 3, 1866, p. xlv.), especially by mr. belt. hence mr. bates inferred that the butterflies which imitate the protected species have acquired their present marvellously deceptive appearance through variation and natural selection, in order to be mistaken for the protected kinds, and thus to escape being devoured. no explanation is here attempted of the brilliant colours of the imitated, but only of the imitating butterflies. we must account for the colours of the former in the same general manner, as in the cases previously discussed in this chapter. since the publication of mr. bates' paper, similar and equally striking facts have been observed by mr. wallace in the malayan region, by mr. trimen in south africa, and by mr. riley in the united states. (31. wallace, 'transact. linn. soc.' vol. xxv. 1865 p. i.; also, 'transact. ent. soc.' vol. iv. (3rd series), 1867, p. 301. trimen, 'linn. transact.' vol. xxvi. 1869, p. 497. riley, 'third annual report on the noxious insects of missouri,' 1871, pp. 163-168. this latter essay is valuable, as mr. riley here discusses all the objections which have been raised against mr. bates's theory.) as some writers have felt much difficulty in understanding how the first steps in the process of mimicry could have been effected through natural selection, it may be well to remark that the process probably commenced long ago between forms not widely dissimilar in colour. in this case even a slight variation would be beneficial, if it rendered the one species more like the other; and afterwards the imitated species might be modified to an extreme degree through sexual selection or other means, and if the changes were gradual, the imitators might easily be led along the same track, until they differed to an equally extreme degree from their original condition; and they would thus ultimately assume an appearance or colouring wholly unlike that of the other members of the group to which they belonged. it should also be remembered that many species of lepidoptera are liable to considerable and abrupt variations in colour. a few instances have been given in this chapter; and many more may be found in the papers of mr. bates and mr. wallace. with several species the sexes are alike, and imitate the two sexes of another species. but mr. trimen gives, in the paper already referred to, three cases in which the sexes of the imitated form differ from each other in colour, and the sexes of the imitating form differ in a like manner. several cases have also been recorded where the females alone imitate brilliantly-coloured and protected species, the males retaining "the normal aspect of their immediate congeners." it is here obvious that the successive variations by which the female has been modified have been transmitted to her alone. it is, however, probable that some of the many successive variations would have been transmitted to, and developed in, the males had not such males been eliminated by being thus rendered less attractive to the females; so that only those variations were preserved which were from the first strictly limited in their transmission to the female sex. we have a partial illustration of these remarks in a statement by mr. belt (32. 'the naturalist in nicaragua,' 1874, p. 385.); that the males of some of the leptalides, which imitate protected species, still retain in a concealed manner some of their original characters. thus in the males "the upper half of the lower wing is of a pure white, whilst all the rest of the wings is barred and spotted with black, red and yellow, like the species they mimic. the females have not this white patch, and the males usually conceal it by covering it with the upper wing, so that i cannot imagine its being of any other use to them than as an attraction in courtship, when they exhibit it to the females, and thus gratify their deep-seated preference for the normal colour of the order to which the leptalides belong." bright colours of caterpillars. whilst reflecting on the beauty of many butterflies, it occurred to me that some caterpillars were splendidly coloured; and as sexual selection could not possibly have here acted, it appeared rash to attribute the beauty of the mature insect to this agency, unless the bright colours of their larvae could be somehow explained. in the first place, it may be observed that the colours of caterpillars do not stand in any close correlation with those of the mature insect. secondly, their bright colours do not serve in any ordinary manner as a protection. mr. bates informs me, as an instance of this, that the most conspicuous caterpillar which he ever beheld (that of a sphinx) lived on the large green leaves of a tree on the open llanos of south america; it was about four inches in length, transversely banded with black and yellow, and with its head, legs, and tail of a bright red. hence it caught the eye of any one who passed by, even at the distance of many yards, and no doubt that of every passing bird. i then applied to mr. wallace, who has an innate genius for solving difficulties. after some consideration he replied: "most caterpillars require protection, as may be inferred from some kinds being furnished with spines or irritating hairs, and from many being coloured green like the leaves on which they feed, or being curiously like the twigs of the trees on which they live." another instance of protection, furnished me by mr. j. mansel weale, may be added, namely, that there is a caterpillar of a moth which lives on the mimosas in south africa, and fabricates for itself a case quite indistinguishable from the surrounding thorns. from such considerations mr. wallace thought it probable that conspicuously coloured caterpillars were protected by having a nauseous taste; but as their skin is extremely tender, and as their intestines readily protrude from a wound, a slight peck from the beak of a bird would be as fatal to them as if they had been devoured. hence, as mr. wallace remarks, "distastefulness alone would be insufficient to protect a caterpillar unless some outward sign indicated to its would-be destroyer that its prey was a disgusting morsel." under these circumstances it would be highly advantageous to a caterpillar to be instantaneously and certainly recognised as unpalatable by all birds and other animals. thus the most gaudy colours would be serviceable, and might have been gained by variation and the survival of the most easily- recognised individuals. this hypothesis appears at first sight very bold, but when it was brought before the entomological society (33. 'proceedings, entomological society,' dec. 3, 1866, p. xlv. and march 4, 1867, p. lxxx.) it was supported by various statements; and mr. j. jenner weir, who keeps a large number of birds in an aviary, informs me that he has made many trials, and finds no exception to the rule, that all caterpillars of nocturnal and retiring habits with smooth skins, all of a green colour, and all which imitate twigs, are greedily devoured by his birds. the hairy and spinose kinds are invariably rejected, as were four conspicuously-coloured species. when the birds rejected a caterpillar, they plainly shewed, by shaking their heads, and cleansing their beaks, that they were disgusted by the taste. (34. see mr. j. jenner weir's paper on insects and insectivorous birds, in 'transact. ent. soc.' 1869, p. 21; also mr. butler's paper, ibid. p. 27. mr. riley has given analogous facts in the 'third annual report on the noxious insects of missouri,' 1871, p. 148. some opposed cases are, however, given by dr. wallace and m. h. d'orville; see 'zoological record,' 1869, p. 349.) three conspicuous kinds of caterpillars and moths were also given to some lizards and frogs, by mr. a. butler, and were rejected, though other kinds were eagerly eaten. thus the probability of mr. wallace's view is confirmed, namely, that certain caterpillars have been made conspicuous for their own good, so as to be easily recognised by their enemies, on nearly the same principle that poisons are sold in coloured bottles by druggists for the good of man. we cannot, however, at present thus explain the elegant diversity in the colours of many caterpillars; but any species which had at some former period acquired a dull, mottled, or striped appearance, either in imitation of surrounding objects, or from the direct action of climate, etc., almost certainly would not become uniform in colour, when its tints were rendered intense and bright; for in order to make a caterpillar merely conspicuous, there would be no selection in any definite direction. summary and concluding remarks on insects. looking back to the several orders, we see that the sexes often differ in various characters, the meaning of which is not in the least understood. the sexes, also, often differ in their organs of sense and means of locomotion, so that the males may quickly discover and reach the females. they differ still oftener in the males possessing diversified contrivances for retaining the females when found. we are, however, here concerned only in a secondary degree with sexual differences of these kinds. in almost all the orders, the males of some species, even of weak and delicate kinds, are known to be highly pugnacious; and some few are furnished with special weapons for fighting with their rivals. but the law of battle does not prevail nearly so widely with insects as with the higher animals. hence it probably arises, that it is in only a few cases that the males have been rendered larger and stronger than the females. on the contrary, they are usually smaller, so that they may be developed within a shorter time, to be ready in large numbers for the emergence of the females. in two families of the homoptera and in three of the orthoptera, the males alone possess sound-producing organs in an efficient state. these are used incessantly during the breeding-season, not only for calling the females, but apparently for charming or exciting them in rivalry with other males. no one who admits the agency of selection of any kind, will, after reading the above discussion, dispute that these musical instruments have been acquired through sexual selection. in four other orders the members of one sex, or more commonly of both sexes, are provided with organs for producing various sounds, which apparently serve merely as call-notes. when both sexes are thus provided, the individuals which were able to make the loudest or most continuous noise would gain partners before those which were less noisy, so that their organs have probably been gained through sexual selection. it is instructive to reflect on the wonderful diversity of the means for producing sound, possessed by the males alone, or by both sexes, in no less than six orders. we thus learn how effectual sexual selection has been in leading to modifications which sometimes, as with the homoptera, relate to important parts of the organisation. from the reasons assigned in the last chapter, it is probable that the great horns possessed by the males of many lamellicorn, and some other beetles, have been acquired as ornaments. from the small size of insects, we are apt to undervalue their appearance. if we could imagine a male chalcosoma (fig. 16), with its polished bronzed coat of mail, and its vast complex horns, magnified to the size of a horse, or even of a dog, it would be one of the most imposing animals in the world. the colouring of insects is a complex and obscure subject. when the male differs slightly from the female, and neither are brilliantly-coloured, it is probable that the sexes have varied in a slightly different manner, and that the variations have been transmitted by each sex to the same without any benefit or evil thus accruing. when the male is brilliantly-coloured and differs conspicuously from the female, as with some dragon-flies and many butterflies, it is probable that he owes his colours to sexual selection; whilst the female has retained a primordial or very ancient type of colouring, slightly modified by the agencies before explained. but in some cases the female has apparently been made obscure by variations transmitted to her alone, as a means of direct protection; and it is almost certain that she has sometimes been made brilliant, so as to imitate other protected species inhabiting the same district. when the sexes resemble each other and both are obscurely coloured, there is no doubt that they have been in a multitude of cases so coloured for the sake of protection. so it is in some instances when both are brightly-coloured, for they thus imitate protected species, or resemble surrounding objects such as flowers; or they give notice to their enemies that they are unpalatable. in other cases in which the sexes resemble each other and are both brilliant, especially when the colours are arranged for display, we may conclude that they have been gained by the male sex as an attraction, and have been transferred to the female. we are more especially led to this conclusion whenever the same type of coloration prevails throughout a whole group, and we find that the males of some species differ widely in colour from the females, whilst others differ slightly or not at all with intermediate gradations connecting these extreme states. in the same manner as bright colours have often been partially transferred from the males to the females, so it has been with the extraordinary horns of many lamellicorn and some other beetles. so again, the sound-producing organs proper to the males of the homoptera and orthoptera have generally been transferred in a rudimentary, or even in a nearly perfect condition, to the females; yet not sufficiently perfect to be of any use. it is also an interesting fact, as bearing on sexual selection, that the stridulating organs of certain male orthoptera are not fully developed until the last moult; and that the colours of certain male dragon-flies are not fully developed until some little time after their emergence from the pupal state, and when they are ready to breed. sexual selection implies that the more attractive individuals are preferred by the opposite sex; and as with insects, when the sexes differ, it is the male which, with some rare exceptions, is the more ornamented, and departs more from the type to which the species belongs;--and as it is the male which searches eagerly for the female, we must suppose that the females habitually or occasionally prefer the more beautiful males, and that these have thus acquired their beauty. that the females in most or all the orders would have the power of rejecting any particular male, is probable from the many singular contrivances possessed by the males, such as great jaws, adhesive cushions, spines, elongated legs, etc., for seizing the female; for these contrivances show that there is some difficulty in the act, so that her concurrence would seem necessary. judging from what we know of the perceptive powers and affections of various insects, there is no antecedent improbability in sexual selection having come largely into play; but we have as yet no direct evidence on this head, and some facts are opposed to the belief. nevertheless, when we see many males pursuing the same female, we can hardly believe that the pairing is left to blind chance--that the female exerts no choice, and is not influenced by the gorgeous colours or other ornaments with which the male is decorated. if we admit that the females of the homoptera and orthoptera appreciate the musical tones of their male partners, and that the various instruments have been perfected through sexual selection, there is little improbability in the females of other insects appreciating beauty in form or colour, and consequently in such characters having been thus gained by the males. but from the circumstance of colour being so variable, and from its having been so often modified for the sake of protection, it is difficult to decide in how large a proportion of cases sexual selection has played a part. this is more especially difficult in those orders, such as orthoptera, hymenoptera, and coleoptera, in which the two sexes rarely differ much in colour; for we are then left to mere analogy. with the coleoptera, however, as before remarked, it is in the great lamellicorn group, placed by some authors at the head of the order, and in which we sometimes see a mutual attachment between the sexes, that we find the males of some species possessing weapons for sexual strife, others furnished with wonderful horns, many with stridulating organs, and others ornamented with splendid metallic tints. hence it seems probable that all these characters have been gained through the same means, namely sexual selection. with butterflies we have the best evidence, as the males sometimes take pains to display their beautiful colours; and we cannot believe that they would act thus, unless the display was of use to them in their courtship. when we treat of birds, we shall see that they present in their secondary sexual characters the closest analogy with insects. thus, many male birds are highly pugnacious, and some are furnished with special weapons for fighting with their rivals. they possess organs which are used during the breeding-season for producing vocal and instrumental music. they are frequently ornamented with combs, horns, wattles and plumes of the most diversified kinds, and are decorated with beautiful colours, all evidently for the sake of display. we shall find that, as with insects, both sexes in certain groups are equally beautiful, and are equally provided with ornaments which are usually confined to the male sex. in other groups both sexes are equally plain-coloured and unornamented. lastly, in some few anomalous cases, the females are more beautiful than the males. we shall often find, in the same group of birds, every gradation from no difference between the sexes, to an extreme difference. we shall see that female birds, like female insects, often possess more or less plain traces or rudiments of characters which properly belong to the males and are of use only to them. the analogy, indeed, in all these respects between birds and insects is curiously close. whatever explanation applies to the one class probably applies to the other; and this explanation, as we shall hereafter attempt to shew in further detail, is sexual selection. chapter xii. secondary sexual characters of fishes, amphibians, and reptiles. fishes: courtship and battles of the males--larger size of the females-- males, bright colours and ornamental appendages; other strange characters-- colours and appendages acquired by the males during the breeding-season alone--fishes with both sexes brilliantly coloured--protective colours--the less conspicuous colours of the female cannot be accounted for on the principle of protection--male fishes building nests, and taking charge of the ova and young. amphibians: differences in structure and colour between the sexes--vocal organs. reptiles: chelonians--crocodiles--snakes, colours in some cases protective--lizards, battles of--ornamental appendages--strange differences in structure between the sexes--colours--sexual differences almost as great as with birds. we have now arrived at the great sub-kingdom of the vertebrata, and will commence with the lowest class, that of fishes. the males of plagiostomous fishes (sharks, rays) and of chimaeroid fishes are provided with claspers which serve to retain the female, like the various structures possessed by many of the lower animals. besides the claspers, the males of many rays have clusters of strong sharp spines on their heads, and several rows along "the upper outer surface of their pectoral fins." these are present in the males of some species, which have other parts of their bodies smooth. they are only temporarily developed during the breeding-season; and dr. gunther suspects that they are brought into action as prehensile organs by the doubling inwards and downwards of the two sides of the body. it is a remarkable fact that the females and not the males of some species, as of raia clavata, have their backs studded with large hook-formed spines. (1. yarrell's 'hist. of british fishes,' vol. ii. 1836, pp 417, 425, 436. dr. gunther informs me that the spines in r. clavata are peculiar to the female.) the males alone of the capelin (mallotus villosus, one of salmonidae), are provided with a ridge of closely-set, brush-like scales, by the aid of which two males, one on each side, hold the female, whilst she runs with great swiftness on the sandy beach, and there deposits her spawn. (2. the 'american naturalist,' april 1871, p. 119.) the widely distinct monacanthus scopas presents a somewhat analogous structure. the male, as dr. gunther informs me, has a cluster of stiff, straight spines, like those of a comb, on the sides of the tail; and these in a specimen six inches long were nearly one and a half inches in length; the female has in the same place a cluster of bristles, which may be compared with those of a tooth-brush. in another species, m. peronii, the male has a brush like that possessed by the female of the last species, whilst the sides of the tail in the female are smooth. in some other species of the same genus the tail can be perceived to be a little roughened in the male and perfectly smooth in the female; and lastly in others, both sexes have smooth sides. the males of many fish fight for the possession of the females. thus the male stickleback (gasterosteus leiurus) has been described as "mad with delight," when the female comes out of her hiding-place and surveys the nest which he has made for her. "he darts round her in every direction, then to his accumulated materials for the nest, then back again in an instant; and as she does not advance he endeavours to push her with his snout, and then tries to pull her by the tail and side-spine to the nest." (3. see mr. r. warington's interesting articles in 'annals and magazine of natural history,' october 1852, and november 1855.) the males are said to be polygamists (4. noel humphreys, 'river gardens,' 1857.); they are extraordinarily bold and pugnacious, whilst "the females are quite pacific." their battles are at times desperate; "for these puny combatants fasten tight on each other for several seconds, tumbling over and over again until their strength appears completely exhausted." with the rough- tailed stickleback (g. trachurus) the males whilst fighting swim round and round each other, biting and endeavouring to pierce each other with their raised lateral spines. the same writer adds (5. loudon's 'magazine of natural history,' vol. iii. 1830, p. 331.), "the bite of these little furies is very severe. they also use their lateral spines with such fatal effect, that i have seen one during a battle absolutely rip his opponent quite open, so that he sank to the bottom and died." when a fish is conquered, "his gallant bearing forsakes him; his gay colours fade away; and he hides his disgrace among his peaceable companions, but is for some time the constant object of his conqueror's persecution." the male salmon is as pugnacious as the little stickleback; and so is the male trout, as i hear from dr. gunther. mr. shaw saw a violent contest between two male salmon which lasted the whole day; and mr. r. buist, superintendent of fisheries, informs me that he has often watched from the bridge at perth the males driving away their rivals, whilst the females were spawning. the males "are constantly fighting and tearing each other on the spawning-beds, and many so injure each other as to cause the death of numbers, many being seen swimming near the banks of the river in a state of exhaustion, and apparently in a dying state." (6. the 'field,' june 29, 1867. for mr. shaw's statement, see 'edinburgh review,' 1843. another experienced observer (scrope's 'days of salmon fishing,' p. 60) remarks that like the stag, the male would, if he could, keep all other males away.) mr. buist informs me, that in june 1868, the keeper of the stormontfield breeding-ponds visited the northern tyne and found about 300 dead salmon, all of which with one exception were males; and he was convinced that they had lost their lives by fighting. [fig. 27. head of male common salmon (salmo salar) during the breeding- season. [this drawing, as well as all the others in the present chapter, have been executed by the well-known artist, mr. g. ford, from specimens in the british museum, under the kind superintendence of dr. gunther.] fig. 28. head of female salmon.] the most curious point about the male salmon is that during the breeding- season, besides a slight change in colour, "the lower jaw elongates, and a cartilaginous projection turns upwards from the point, which, when the jaws are closed, occupies a deep cavity between the intermaxillary bones of the upper jaw." (7. yarrell, 'history of british fishes,' vol. ii. 1836, p. 10.) (figs. 27 and 28.) in our salmon this change of structure lasts only during the breeding-season; but in the salmo lycaodon of n.w. america the change, as mr. j.k. lord (8. 'the naturalist in vancouver's island,' vol. i. 1866, p. 54.) believes, is permanent, and best marked in the older males which have previously ascended the rivers. in these old males the jaw becomes developed into an immense hook-like projection, and the teeth grow into regular fangs, often more than half an inch in length. with the european salmon, according to mr. lloyd (9. 'scandinavian adventures,' vol. i. 1854, pp. 100, 104.), the temporary hook-like structure serves to strengthen and protect the jaws, when one male charges another with wonderful violence; but the greatly developed teeth of the male american salmon may be compared with the tusks of many male mammals, and they indicate an offensive rather than a protective purpose. the salmon is not the only fish in which the teeth differ in the two sexes; as this is the case with many rays. in the thornback (raia clavata) the adult male has sharp, pointed teeth, directed backwards, whilst those of the female are broad and flat, and form a pavement; so that these teeth differ in the two sexes of the same species more than is usual in distinct genera of the same family. the teeth of the male become sharp only when he is adult: whilst young they are broad and flat like those of the female. as so frequently occurs with secondary sexual characters, both sexes of some species of rays (for instance r. batis), when adult, possess sharp pointed teeth; and here a character, proper to and primarily gained by the male, appears to have been transmitted to the offspring of both sexes. the teeth are likewise pointed in both sexes of r. maculata, but only when quite adult; the males acquiring them at an earlier age than the females. we shall hereafter meet with analogous cases in certain birds, in which the male acquires the plumage common to both sexes when adult, at a somewhat earlier age than does the female. with other species of rays the males even when old never possess sharp teeth, and consequently the adults of both sexes are provided with broad, flat teeth like those of the young, and like those of the mature females of the above-mentioned species. (10. see yarrell's account of the rays in his 'history of british fishes,' vol. ii. 1836, p. 416, with an excellent figure, and pp. 422, 432.) as the rays are bold, strong and voracious fish, we may suspect that the males require their sharp teeth for fighting with their rivals; but as they possess many parts modified and adapted for the prehension of the female, it is possible that their teeth may be used for this purpose. in regard to size, m. carbonnier (11. as quoted in 'the farmer,' 1868, p. 369.) maintains that the female of almost all fishes is larger than the male; and dr. gunther does not know of a single instance in which the male is actually larger than the female. with some cyprinodonts the male is not even half as large. as in many kinds of fishes the males habitually fight together, it is surprising that they have not generally become larger and stronger than the females through the effects of sexual selection. the males suffer from their small size, for according to m. carbonnier, they are liable to be devoured by the females of their own species when carnivorous, and no doubt by other species. increased size must be in some manner of more importance to the females, than strength and size are to the males for fighting with other males; and this perhaps is to allow of the production of a vast number of ova. [fig. 29. callionymus lyra. upper figure, male; lower figure, female. n.b. the lower figure is more reduced than the upper.] in many species the male alone is ornamented with bright colours; or these are much brighter in the male than the female. the male, also, is sometimes provided with appendages which appear to be of no more use to him for the ordinary purposes of life, than are the tail feathers to the peacock. i am indebted for most of the following facts to the kindness of dr. gunther. there is reason to suspect that many tropical fishes differ sexually in colour and structure; and there are some striking cases with our british fishes. the male callionymus lyra has been called the gemmeous dragonet "from its brilliant gem-like colours." when fresh caught from the sea the body is yellow of various shades, striped and spotted with vivid blue on the head; the dorsal fins are pale brown with dark longitudinal bands; the ventral, caudal, and anal fins being bluish-black. the female, or sordid dragonet, was considered by linnaeus, and by many subsequent naturalists, as a distinct species; it is of a dingy reddish-brown, with the dorsal fin brown and the other fins white. the sexes differ also in the proportional size of the head and mouth, and in the position of the eyes (12. i have drawn up this description from yarrell's 'british fishes,' vol. i. 1836, pp. 261 and 266.); but the most striking difference is the extraordinary elongation in the male (fig. 29) of the dorsal fin. mr. w. saville kent remarks that this "singular appendage appears from my observations of the species in confinement, to be subservient to the same end as the wattles, crests, and other abnormal adjuncts of the male in gallinaceous birds, for the purpose of fascinating their mates." (13. 'nature,' july 1873, p. 264.) the young males resemble the adult females in structure and colour. throughout the genus callionymus (14. 'catalogue of acanth. fishes in the british museum,' by dr. gunther, 1861, pp. 138- 151.), the male is generally much more brightly spotted than the female, and in several species, not only the dorsal, but the anal fin is much elongated in the males. the male of the cottus scorpius, or sea-scorpion, is slenderer and smaller than the female. there is also a great difference in colour between them. it is difficult, as mr. lloyd (15. 'game birds of sweden,' etc., 1867, p. 466.) remarks, "for any one, who has not seen this fish during the spawning-season, when its hues are brightest, to conceive the admixture of brilliant colours with which it, in other respects so ill-favoured, is at that time adorned." both sexes of the labrus mixtus, although very different in colour, are beautiful; the male being orange with bright blue stripes, and the female bright red with some black spots on the back. [fig. 30. xiphophorus hellerii. upper figure, male; lower figure, female.] in the very distinct family of the cyprinodontidae--inhabitants of the fresh waters of foreign lands--the sexes sometimes differ much in various characters. in the male of the mollienesia petenensis (16. with respect to this and the following species i am indebted to dr. gunther for information: see also his paper on the 'fishes of central america,' in 'transact. zoological soc.' vol. vi. 1868, p. 485.), the dorsal fin is greatly developed and is marked with a row of large, round, ocellated, bright-coloured spots; whilst the same fin in the female is smaller, of a different shape, and marked only with irregularly curved brown spots. in the male the basal margin of the anal fin is also a little produced and dark coloured. in the male of an allied form, the xiphophorus hellerii (fig. 30), the inferior margin of the caudal fin is developed into a long filament, which, as i hear from dr. gunther, is striped with bright colours. this filament does not contain any muscles, and apparently cannot be of any direct use to the fish. as in the case of the callionymus, the males whilst young resemble the adult females in colour and structure. sexual differences such as these may be strictly compared with those which are so frequent with gallinaceous birds. (17. dr. gunther makes this remark; 'catalogue of fishes in the british museum,' vol. iii. 1861, p. 141.) [fig.31. plecostomus barbatus. upper figure, head of male; lower figure, female.] in a siluroid fish, inhabiting the fresh waters of south america, the plecostomus barbatus (18. see dr. gunther on this genus, in 'proceedings of the zoological society,' 1868, p. 232.) (fig. 31), the male has its mouth and inter-operculum fringed with a beard of stiff hairs, of which the female shows hardly a trace. these hairs are of the nature of scales. in another species of the same genus, soft flexible tentacles project from the front part of the head of the male, which are absent in the female. these tentacles are prolongations of the true skin, and therefore are not homologous with the stiff hairs of the former species; but it can hardly be doubted that both serve the same purpose. what this purpose may be, it is difficult to conjecture; ornament does not here seem probable, but we can hardly suppose that stiff hairs and flexible filaments can be useful in any ordinary way to the males alone. in that strange monster, the chimaera monstrosa, the male has a hook-shaped bone on the top of the head, directed forwards, with its end rounded and covered with sharp spines; in the female "this crown is altogether absent," but what its use may be to the male is utterly unknown. (19. f. buckland, in 'land and water,' july 1868, p. 377, with a figure. many other cases could be added of structures peculiar to the male, of which the uses are not known.) the structures as yet referred to are permanent in the male after he has arrived at maturity; but with some blennies, and in another allied genus (20. dr. gunther, 'catalogue of fishes,' vol. iii. pp. 221 and 240.), a crest is developed on the head of the male only during the breeding-season, and the body at the same time becomes more brightly-coloured. there can be little doubt that this crest serves as a temporary sexual ornament, for the female does not exhibit a trace of it. in other species of the same genus both sexes possess a crest, and in at least one species neither sex is thus provided. in many of the chromidae, for instance in geophagus and especially in cichla, the males, as i hear from professor agassiz (21. see also 'a journey in brazil,' by prof. and mrs. agassiz, 1868, p. 220.), have a conspicuous protuberance on the forehead, which is wholly wanting in the females and in the young males. professor agassiz adds, "i have often observed these fishes at the time of spawning when the protuberance is largest, and at other seasons when it is totally wanting, and the two sexes shew no difference whatever in the outline of the profile of the head. i never could ascertain that it subserves any special function, and the indians on the amazon know nothing about its use." these protuberances resemble, in their periodical appearance, the fleshy carbuncles on the heads of certain birds; but whether they serve as ornaments must remain at present doubtful. i hear from professor agassiz and dr. gunther, that the males of those fishes, which differ permanently in colour from the females, often become more brilliant during the breeding-season. this is likewise the case with a multitude of fishes, the sexes of which are identical in colour at all other seasons of the year. the tench, roach, and perch may be given as instances. the male salmon at this season is "marked on the cheeks with orange-coloured stripes, which give it the appearance of a labrus, and the body partakes of a golden orange tinge. the females are dark in colour, and are commonly called black-fish." (22. yarrell, 'history of british fishes,' vol. ii. 1836, pp. 10, 12, 35.) an analogous and even greater change takes place with the salmo eriox or bull trout; the males of the char (s. umbla) are likewise at this season rather brighter in colour than the females. (23. w. thompson, in 'annals and magazine of natural history,' vol. vi. 1841, p. 440.) the colours of the pike (esox reticulatus) of the united states, especially of the male, become, during the breeding-season, exceedingly intense, brilliant, and iridescent. (24. 'the american agriculturalist,' 1868, p. 100.) another striking instance out of many is afforded by the male stickleback (gasterosteus leiurus), which is described by mr. warington (25. 'annals and mag. of nat. hist.' oct. 1852.), as being then "beautiful beyond description." the back and eyes of the female are simply brown, and the belly white. the eyes of the male, on the other hand, are "of the most splendid green, having a metallic lustre like the green feathers of some humming-birds. the throat and belly are of a bright crimson, the back of an ashy-green, and the whole fish appears as though it were somewhat translucent and glowed with an internal incandescence." after the breeding season these colours all change, the throat and belly become of a paler red, the back more green, and the glowing tints subside. with respect to the courtship of fishes, other cases have been observed since the first edition of this book appeared, besides that already given of the stickleback. mr. w.s. kent says that the male of the labrus mixtus, which, as we have seen, differs in colour from the female, makes "a deep hollow in the sand of the tank, and then endeavours in the most persuasive manner to induce a female of the same species to share it with him, swimming backwards and forwards between her and the completed nest, and plainly exhibiting the greatest anxiety for her to follow." the males of cantharus lineatus become, during the breeding-season, of deep leaden- black; they then retire from the shoal, and excavate a hollow as a nest. "each male now mounts vigilant guard over his respective hollow, and vigorously attacks and drives away any other fish of the same sex. towards his companions of the opposite sex his conduct is far different; many of the latter are now distended with spawn, and these he endeavours by all the means in his power to lure singly to his prepared hollow, and there to deposit the myriad ova with which they are laden, which he then protects and guards with the greatest care." (26. 'nature,' may 1873, p. 25.) a more striking case of courtship, as well as of display, by the males of a chinese macropus has been given by m. carbonnier, who carefully observed these fishes under confinement. (27. 'bulletin de la societé d'acclimat.' paris, july 1869, and jan. 1870.) the males are most beautifully coloured, more so than the females. during the breeding-season they contend for the possession of the females; and, in the act of courtship, expand their fins, which are spotted and ornamented with brightly coloured rays, in the same manner, according to m. carbonnier, as the peacock. they then also bound about the females with much vivacity, and appear by "l'étalage de leurs vives couleurs chercher a attirer l'attention des femelles, lesquelles ne paraissaient indifférentes a ce manège, elles nageaient avec une molle lenteur vers les males et semblaient se complaire dans leur voisinage." after the male has won his bride, he makes a little disc of froth by blowing air and mucus out of his mouth. he then collects the fertilised ova, dropped by the female, in his mouth; and this caused m. carbonnier much alarm, as he thought that they were going to be devoured. but the male soon deposits them in the disc of froth, afterwards guarding them, repairing the froth, and taking care of the young when hatched. i mention these particulars because, as we shall presently see, there are fishes, the males of which hatch their eggs in their mouths; and those who do not believe in the principle of gradual evolution might ask how could such a habit have originated; but the difficulty is much diminished when we know that there are fishes which thus collect and carry the eggs; for if delayed by any cause in depositing them, the habit of hatching them in their mouths might have been acquired. to return to our more immediate subject. the case stands thus: female fishes, as far as i can learn, never willingly spawn except in the presence of the males; and the males never fertilise the ova except in the presence of the females. the males fight for the possession of the females. in many species, the males whilst young resemble the females in colour; but when adult become much more brilliant, and retain their colours throughout life. in other species the males become brighter than the females and otherwise more highly ornamented, only during the season of love. the males sedulously court the females, and in one case, as we have seen, take pains in displaying their beauty before them. can it be believed that they would thus act to no purpose during their courtship? and this would be the case, unless the females exert some choice and select those males which please or excite them most. if the female exerts such choice, all the above facts on the ornamentation of the males become at once intelligible by the aid of sexual selection. we have next to inquire whether this view of the bright colours of certain male fishes having been acquired through sexual selection can, through the law of the equal transmission of characters to both sexes, be extended to those groups in which the males and females are brilliant in the same, or nearly the same degree and manner. in such a genus as labrus, which includes some of the most splendid fishes in the world--for instance, the peacock labrus (l. pavo), described (28. bory saint vincent, in 'dict. class. d'hist. nat.' tom. ix. 1826, p. 151.), with pardonable exaggeration, as formed of polished scales of gold, encrusting lapis-lazuli, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and amethysts--we may, with much probability, accept this belief; for we have seen that the sexes in at least one species of the genus differ greatly in colour. with some fishes, as with many of the lowest animals, splendid colours may be the direct result of the nature of their tissues and of the surrounding conditions, without the aid of selection of any kind. the gold-fish (cyprinus auratus), judging from the analogy of the golden variety of the common carp, is perhaps a case in point, as it may owe its splendid colours to a single abrupt variation, due to the conditions to which this fish has been subjected under confinement. it is, however, more probable that these colours have been intensified through artificial selection, as this species has been carefully bred in china from a remote period. (29. owing to some remarks on this subject, made in my work 'on the variation of animals under domestication,' mr. w.f. mayers ('chinese notes and queries,' aug. 1868, p. 123) has searched the ancient chinese encyclopedias. he finds that gold-fish were first reared in confinement during the sung dynasty, which commenced a.d. 960. in the year 1129 these fishes abounded. in another place it is said that since the year 1548 there has been "produced at hangchow a variety called the fire-fish, from its intensely red colour. it is universally admired, and there is not a household where it is not cultivated, in rivalry as to its colour, and as a source of profit.") under natural conditions it does not seem probable that beings so highly organised as fishes, and which live under such complex relations, should become brilliantly coloured without suffering some evil or receiving some benefit from so great a change, and consequently without the intervention of natural selection. what, then, are we to conclude in regard to the many fishes, both sexes of which are splendidly coloured? mr. wallace (30. 'westminster review,' july 1867, p. 7.) believes that the species which frequent reefs, where corals and other brightly-coloured organisms abound, are brightly coloured in order to escape detection by their enemies; but according to my recollection they were thus rendered highly conspicuous. in the fresh- waters of the tropics there are no brilliantly-coloured corals or other organisms for the fishes to resemble; yet many species in the amazons are beautifully coloured, and many of the carnivorous cyprinidae in india are ornamented with "bright longitudinal lines of various tints." (31. 'indian cyprinidae,' by mr. m'clelland, 'asiatic researches,' vol. xix. part ii. 1839, p. 230.) mr. m'clelland, in describing these fishes, goes so far as to suppose that "the peculiar brilliancy of their colours" serves as "a better mark for king-fishers, terns, and other birds which are destined to keep the number of these fishes in check"; but at the present day few naturalists will admit that any animal has been made conspicuous as an aid to its own destruction. it is possible that certain fishes may have been rendered conspicuous in order to warn birds and beasts of prey that they were unpalatable, as explained when treating of caterpillars; but it is not, i believe, known that any fish, at least any fresh-water fish, is rejected from being distasteful to fish-devouring animals. on the whole, the most probable view in regard to the fishes, of which both sexes are brilliantly coloured, is that their colours were acquired by the males as a sexual ornament, and were transferred equally, or nearly so, to the other sex. we have now to consider whether, when the male differs in a marked manner from the female in colour or in other ornaments, he alone has been modified, the variations being inherited by his male offspring alone; or whether the female has been specially modified and rendered inconspicuous for the sake of protection, such modifications being inherited only by the females. it is impossible to doubt that colour has been gained by many fishes as a protection: no one can examine the speckled upper surface of a flounder, and overlook its resemblance to the sandy bed of the sea on which it lives. certain fishes, moreover, can through the action of the nervous system change their colours in adaptation to surrounding objects, and that within a short time. (32. g. pouchet, 'l'institut.' nov. 1, 1871, p. 134.) one of the most striking instances ever recorded of an animal being protected by its colour (as far as it can be judged of in preserved specimens), as well as by its form, is that given by dr. gunther (33. 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1865, p. 327, pl. xiv. and xv.) of a pipe-fish, which, with its reddish streaming filaments, is hardly distinguishable from the sea-weed to which it clings with its prehensile tail. but the question now under consideration is whether the females alone have been modified for this object. we can see that one sex will not be modified through natural selection for the sake of protection more than the other, supposing both to vary, unless one sex is exposed for a longer period to danger, or has less power of escaping from such danger than the other; and it does not appear that with fishes the sexes differ in these respects. as far as there is any difference, the males, from being generally smaller and from wandering more about, are exposed to greater danger than the females; and yet, when the sexes differ, the males are almost always the more conspicuously coloured. the ova are fertilised immediately after being deposited; and when this process lasts for several days, as in the case of the salmon (34. yarrell, 'british fishes,' vol. ii. p. 11.), the female, during the whole time, is attended by the male. after the ova are fertilised they are, in most cases, left unprotected by both parents, so that the males and females, as far as oviposition is concerned, are equally exposed to danger, and both are equally important for the production of fertile ova; consequently the more or less brightly-coloured individuals of either sex would be equally liable to be destroyed or preserved, and both would have an equal influence on the colours of their offspring. certain fishes, belonging to several families, make nests, and some of them take care of their young when hatched. both sexes of the bright coloured crenilabrus massa and melops work together in building their nests with sea-weed, shells, etc. (35. according to the observations of m. gerbe; see gunther's 'record of zoolog. literature,' 1865, p. 194.) but the males of certain fishes do all the work, and afterwards take exclusive charge of the young. this is the case with the dull-coloured gobies (36. cuvier, 'regne animal,' vol. ii. 1829, p. 242.), in which the sexes are not known to differ in colour, and likewise with the sticklebacks (gasterosteus), in which the males become brilliantly coloured during the spawning season. the male of the smooth-tailed stickleback (g. leiurus) performs the duties of a nurse with exemplary care and vigilance during a long time, and is continually employed in gently leading back the young to the nest, when they stray too far. he courageously drives away all enemies including the females of his own species. it would indeed be no small relief to the male, if the female, after depositing her eggs, were immediately devoured by some enemy, for he is forced incessantly to drive her from the nest. (37. see mr. warington's most interesting description of the habits of the gasterosteus leiurus in 'annals and magazine of nat. history,' november 1855.) the males of certain other fishes inhabiting south america and ceylon, belonging to two distinct orders, have the extraordinary habit of hatching within their mouths, or branchial cavities, the eggs laid by the females. (38. prof. wyman, in 'proc. boston soc. of nat. hist.' sept. 15, 1857. also prof. turner, in 'journal of anatomy and physiology,' nov. 1, 1866, p. 78. dr. gunther has likewise described other cases.) i am informed by professor agassiz that the males of the amazonian species which follow this habit, "not only are generally brighter than the females, but the difference is greater at the spawning-season than at any other time." the species of geophagus act in the same manner; and in this genus, a conspicuous protuberance becomes developed on the forehead of the males during the breeding-season. with the various species of chromids, as professor agassiz likewise informs me, sexual differences in colour may be observed, "whether they lay their eggs in the water among aquatic plants, or deposit them in holes, leaving them to come out without further care, or build shallow nests in the river mud, over which they sit, as our pomotis does. it ought also to be observed that these sitters are among the brightest species in their respective families; for instance, hygrogonus is bright green, with large black ocelli, encircled with the most brilliant red." whether with all the species of chromids it is the male alone which sits on the eggs is not known. it is, however, manifest that the fact of the eggs being protected or unprotected by the parents, has had little or no influence on the differences in colour between the sexes. it is further manifest, in all the cases in which the males take exclusive charge of the nests and young, that the destruction of the brighter-coloured males would be far more influential on the character of the race, than the destruction of the brighter-coloured females; for the death of the male during the period of incubation or nursing would entail the death of the young, so that they could not inherit his peculiarities; yet, in many of these very cases the males are more conspicuously coloured than the females. in most of the lophobranchii (pipe-fish, hippocampi, etc.) the males have either marsupial sacks or hemispherical depressions on the abdomen, in which the ova laid by the female are hatched. the males also shew great attachment to their young. (39. yarrell, 'history of british fishes,' vol. ii. 1836, pp. 329, 338.) the sexes do not commonly differ much in colour; but dr. gunther believes that the male hippocampi are rather brighter than the females. the genus solenostoma, however, offers a curious exceptional case (40. dr. gunther, since publishing an account of this species in 'the fishes of zanzibar,' by col. playfair, 1866, p. 137, has re-examined the specimens, and has given me the above information.), for the female is much more vividly-coloured and spotted than the male, and she alone has a marsupial sack and hatches the eggs; so that the female of solenostoma differs from all the other lophobranchii in this latter respect, and from almost all other fishes, in being more brightly-coloured than the male. it is improbable that this remarkable double inversion of character in the female should be an accidental coincidence. as the males of several fishes, which take exclusive charge of the eggs and young, are more brightly coloured than the females, and as here the female solenostoma takes the same charge and is brighter than the male, it might be argued that the conspicuous colours of that sex which is the more important of the two for the welfare of the offspring, must be in some manner protective. but from the large number of fishes, of which the males are either permanently or periodically brighter than the females, but whose life is not at all more important for the welfare of the species than that of the female, this view can hardly be maintained. when we treat of birds we shall meet with analogous cases, where there has been a complete inversion of the usual attributes of the two sexes, and we shall then give what appears to be the probable explanation, namely, that the males have selected the more attractive females, instead of the latter having selected, in accordance with the usual rule throughout the animal kingdom, the more attractive males. on the whole we may conclude, that with most fishes, in which the sexes differ in colour or in other ornamental characters, the males originally varied, with their variations transmitted to the same sex, and accumulated through sexual selection by attracting or exciting the females. in many cases, however, such characters have been transferred, either partially or completely, to the females. in other cases, again, both sexes have been coloured alike for the sake of protection; but in no instance does it appear that the female alone has had her colours or other characters specially modified for this latter purpose. the last point which need be noticed is that fishes are known to make various noises, some of which are described as being musical. dr. dufosse, who has especially attended to this subject, says that the sounds are voluntarily produced in several ways by different fishes: by the friction of the pharyngeal bones--by the vibration of certain muscles attached to the swim bladder, which serves as a resounding board--and by the vibration of the intrinsic muscles of the swim bladder. by this latter means the trigla produces pure and long-drawn sounds which range over nearly an octave. but the most interesting case for us is that of two species of ophidium, in which the males alone are provided with a sound-producing apparatus, consisting of small movable bones, with proper muscles, in connection with the swim bladder. (41. 'comptes-rendus,' tom. xlvi. 1858, p. 353; tom. xlvii. 1858, p. 916; tom. liv. 1862, p. 393. the noise made by the umbrinas (sciaena aquila), is said by some authors to be more like that of a flute or organ, than drumming: dr. zouteveen, in the dutch translation of this work (vol. ii. p. 36), gives some further particulars on the sounds made by fishes.) the drumming of the umbrinas in the european seas is said to be audible from a depth of twenty fathoms; and the fishermen of rochelle assert "that the males alone make the noise during the spawning-time; and that it is possible by imitating it, to take them without bait." (42. the rev. c. kingsley, in 'nature,' may 1870, p. 40.) from this statement, and more especially from the case of ophidium, it is almost certain that in this, the lowest class of the vertebrata, as with so many insects and spiders, sound-producing instruments have, at least in some cases, been developed through sexual selection, as a means for bringing the sexes together. amphibians. urodela. [fig. 32. triton cristatus (half natural size, from bell's 'british reptiles'). upper figure, male during the breeding season; lower figure, female.] i will begin with the tailed amphibians. the sexes of salamanders or newts often differ much both in colour and structure. in some species prehensile claws are developed on the fore-legs of the males during the breeding- season: and at this season in the male triton palmipes the hind-feet are provided with a swimming-web, which is almost completely absorbed during the winter; so that their feet then resemble those of the female. (43. bell, 'history of british reptiles,' 2nd ed., 1849, pp. 156-159.) this structure no doubt aids the male in his eager search and pursuit of the female. whilst courting her he rapidly vibrates the end of his tail. with our common newts (triton punctatus and cristatus) a deep, much indented crest is developed along the back and tail of the male during the breeding- season, which disappears during the winter. mr. st. george mivart informs me that it is not furnished with muscles, and therefore cannot be used for locomotion. as during the season of courtship it becomes edged with bright colours, there can hardly be a doubt that it is a masculine ornament. in many species the body presents strongly contrasted, though lurid tints, and these become more vivid during the breeding-season. the male, for instance, of our common little newt (triton punctatus) is "brownish-grey above, passing into yellow beneath, which in the spring becomes a rich bright orange, marked everywhere with round dark spots." the edge of the crest also is then tipped with bright red or violet. the female is usually of a yellowish-brown colour with scattered brown dots, and the lower surface is often quite plain. (44. bell, 'history of british reptiles,' 2nd ed., 1849, pp. 146, 151.) the young are obscurely tinted. the ova are fertilised during the act of deposition, and are not subsequently tended by either parent. we may therefore conclude that the males have acquired their strongly-marked colours and ornamental appendages through sexual selection; these being transmitted either to the male offspring alone, or to both sexes. anura or batrachia. with many frogs and toads the colours evidently serve as a protection, such as the bright green tints of tree frogs and the obscure mottled shades of many terrestrial species. the most conspicuously-coloured toad which i ever saw, the phryniscus nigricans (45. 'zoology of the voyage of the "beagle,"' 1843. bell, ibid. p. 49.), had the whole upper surface of the body as black as ink, with the soles of the feet and parts of the abdomen spotted with the brightest vermilion. it crawled about the bare sandy or open grassy plains of la plata under a scorching sun, and could not fail to catch the eye of every passing creature. these colours are probably beneficial by making this animal known to all birds of prey as a nauseous mouthful. in nicaragua there is a little frog "dressed in a bright livery of red and blue" which does not conceal itself like most other species, but hops about during the daytime, and mr. belt says (46. 'the naturalist in nicaragua,' 1874, p. 321.) that as soon as he saw its happy sense of security, he felt sure that it was uneatable. after several trials he succeeded in tempting a young duck to snatch up a young one, but it was instantly rejected; and the duck "went about jerking its head, as if trying to throw off some unpleasant taste." with respect to sexual differences of colour, dr. gunther does not know of any striking instance either with frogs or toads; yet he can often distinguish the male from the female by the tints of the former being a little more intense. nor does he know of any striking difference in external structure between the sexes, excepting the prominences which become developed during the breeding-season on the front legs of the male, by which he is enabled to hold the female. (47. the male alone of the bufo sikimmensis (dr. anderson, 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1871, p. 204) has two plate-like callosities on the thorax and certain rugosities on the fingers, which perhaps subserve the same end as the above-mentioned prominences.) it is surprising that these animals have not acquired more strongly-marked sexual characters; for though cold-blooded their passions are strong. dr. gunther informs me that he has several times found an unfortunate female toad dead and smothered from having been so closely embraced by three or four males. frogs have been observed by professor hoffman in giessen fighting all day long during the breeding-season, and with so much violence that one had its body ripped open. frogs and toads offer one interesting sexual difference, namely, in the musical powers possessed by the males; but to speak of music, when applied to the discordant and overwhelming sounds emitted by male bull-frogs and some other species, seems, according to our taste, a singularly inappropriate expression. nevertheless, certain frogs sing in a decidedly pleasing manner. near rio janeiro i used often to sit in the evening to listen to a number of little hylae, perched on blades of grass close to the water, which sent forth sweet chirping notes in harmony. the various sounds are emitted chiefly by the males during the breeding-season, as in the case of the croaking of our common frog. (48. bell, 'history british reptiles,' 1849, p. 93.) in accordance with this fact the vocal organs of the males are more highly-developed than those of the females. in some genera the males alone are provided with sacs which open into the larynx. (49. j. bishop, in 'todd's cyclopaedia of anatomy and physiology,' vol. iv. p. 1503.) for instance, in the edible frog (rana esculenta) "the sacs are peculiar to the males, and become, when filled with air in the act of croaking, large globular bladders, standing out one on each side of the head, near the corners of the mouth." the croak of the male is thus rendered exceedingly powerful; whilst that of the female is only a slight groaning noise. (50. bell, ibid. pp. 112-114.) in the several genera of the family the vocal organs differ considerably in structure, and their development in all cases may be attributed to sexual selection. reptiles. chelonia. tortoises and turtles do not offer well-marked sexual differences. in some species, the tail of the male is longer than that of the female. in some, the plastron or lower surface of the shell of the male is slightly concave in relation to the back of the female. the male of the mud-turtle of the united states (chrysemys picta) has claws on its front feet twice as long as those of the female; and these are used when the sexes unite. (51. mr. c.j. maynard, 'the american naturalist,' dec. 1869, p. 555.) with the huge tortoise of the galapagos islands (testudo nigra) the males are said to grow to a larger size than the females: during the pairing-season, and at no other time, the male utters a hoarse bellowing noise, which can be heard at the distance of more than a hundred yards; the female, on the other hand, never uses her voice. (52. see my 'journal of researches during the voyage of the "beagle,"' 1845, p. 384.) with the testudo elegans of india, it is said "that the combats of the males may be heard at some distance, from the noise they produce in butting against each other." (53. dr. gunther, 'reptiles of british india,' 1864, p. 7.) crocodilia. the sexes apparently do not differ in colour; nor do i know that the males fight together, though this is probable, for some kinds make a prodigious display before the females. bartram (54. 'travels through carolina,' etc., 1791, p. 128.) describes the male alligator as striving to win the female by splashing and roaring in the midst of a lagoon, "swollen to an extent ready to burst, with its head and tail lifted up, he springs or twirls round on the surface of the water, like an indian chief rehearsing his feats of war." during the season of love, a musky odour is emitted by the submaxillary glands of the crocodile, and pervades their haunts. (55. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. i. 1866, p. 615.) ophidia. dr. gunther informs me that the males are always smaller than the females, and generally have longer and slenderer tails; but he knows of no other difference in external structure. in regard to colour, be can almost always distinguish the male from the female, by his more strongly- pronounced tints; thus the black zigzag band on the back of the male english viper is more distinctly defined than in the female. the difference is much plainer in the rattle-snakes of n. america, the male of which, as the keeper in the zoological gardens shewed me, can at once be distinguished from the female by having more lurid yellow about its whole body. in s. africa the bucephalus capensis presents an analogous difference, for the female "is never so fully variegated with yellow on the sides as the male." (56. sir andrew smith, 'zoology of s. africa: reptilia,' 1849, pl. x.) the male of the indian dipsas cynodon, on the other hand, is blackish-brown, with the belly partly black, whilst the female is reddish or yellowish-olive, with the belly either uniform yellowish or marbled with black. in the tragops dispar of the same country the male is bright green, and the female bronze-coloured. (57. dr. a. gunther, 'reptiles of british india,' ray soc., 1864, pp. 304, 308.) no doubt the colours of some snakes are protective, as shewn by the green tints of tree-snakes, and the various mottled shades of the species which live in sandy places; but it is doubtful whether the colours of many kinds, for instance of the common english snake and viper, serve to conceal them; and this is still more doubtful with the many foreign species which are coloured with extreme elegance. the colours of certain species are very different in the adult and young states. (58. dr. stoliczka, 'journal of asiatic society of bengal,' vol. xxxix, 1870, pp. 205, 211.) during the breeding-season the anal scent-glands of snakes are in active function (59. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. i. 1866, p. 615.); and so it is with the same glands in lizards, and as we have seen with the submaxillary glands of crocodiles. as the males of most animals search for the females, these odoriferous glands probably serve to excite or charm the female, rather than to guide her to the spot where the male may be found. male snakes, though appearing so sluggish, are amorous; for many have been observed crowding round the same female, and even round her dead body. they are not known to fight together from rivalry. their intellectual powers are higher than might have been anticipated. in the zoological gardens they soon learn not to strike at the iron bar with which their cages are cleaned; and dr. keen of philadelphia informs me that some snakes which he kept learned after four or five times to avoid a noose, with which they were at first easily caught. an excellent observer in ceylon, mr. e. layard, saw (60. 'rambles in ceylon,' in 'annals and magazine of natural history,' 2nd series, vol. ix. 1852, p. 333.) a cobra thrust its head through a narrow hole and swallow a toad. "with this encumbrance he could not withdraw himself; finding this, he reluctantly disgorged the precious morsel, which began to move off; this was too much for snake philosophy to bear, and the toad was again seized, and again was the snake, after violent efforts to escape, compelled to part with its prey. this time, however, a lesson had been learnt, and the toad was seized by one leg, withdrawn, and then swallowed in triumph." the keeper in the zoological gardens is positive that certain snakes, for instance crotalus and python, distinguish him from all other persons. cobras kept together in the same cage apparently feel some attachment towards each other. (61. dr. gunther, 'reptiles of british india,' 1864, p. 340.) it does not, however, follow because snakes have some reasoning power, strong passions and mutual affection, that they should likewise be endowed with sufficient taste to admire brilliant colours in their partners, so as to lead to the adornment of the species through sexual selection. nevertheless, it is difficult to account in any other manner for the extreme beauty of certain species; for instance, of the coral-snakes of s. america, which are of a rich red with black and yellow transverse bands. i well remember how much surprise i felt at the beauty of the first coral- snake which i saw gliding across a path in brazil. snakes coloured in this peculiar manner, as mr. wallace states on the authority of dr. gunther (62. 'westminster review,' july 1st, 1867, p. 32.), are found nowhere else in the world except in s. america, and here no less than four genera occur. one of these, elaps, is venomous; a second and widely-distinct genus is doubtfully venomous, and the two others are quite harmless. the species belonging to these distinct genera inhabit the same districts, and are so like each other that no one "but a naturalist would distinguish the harmless from the poisonous kinds." hence, as mr. wallace believes, the innocuous kinds have probably acquired their colours as a protection, on the principle of imitation; for they would naturally be thought dangerous by their enemies. the cause, however, of the bright colours of the venomous elaps remains to be explained, and this may perhaps be sexual selection. snakes produce other sounds besides hissing. the deadly echis carinata has on its sides some oblique rows of scales of a peculiar structure with serrated edges; and when this snake is excited these scales are rubbed against each other, which produces "a curious prolonged, almost hissing sound." (63. dr. anderson, 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1871, p. 196.) with respect to the rattling of the rattle-snake, we have at last some definite information: for professor aughey states (64. the 'american naturalist,' 1873, p. 85.), that on two occasions, being himself unseen, he watched from a little distance a rattle-snake coiled up with head erect, which continued to rattle at short intervals for half an hour: and at last he saw another snake approach, and when they met they paired. hence he is satisfied that one of the uses of the rattle is to bring the sexes together. unfortunately he did not ascertain whether it was the male or the female which remained stationary and called for the other. but it by no means follows from the above fact that the rattle may not be of use to these snakes in other ways, as a warning to animals which would otherwise attack them. nor can i quite disbelieve the several accounts which have appeared of their thus paralysing their prey with fear. some other snakes also make a distinct noise by rapidly vibrating their tails against the surrounding stalks of plants; and i have myself heard this in the case of a trigonocephalus in s. america. lacertilia. the males of some, probably of many kinds of lizards, fight together from rivalry. thus the arboreal anolis cristatellus of s. america is extremely pugnacious: "during the spring and early part of the summer, two adult males rarely meet without a contest. on first seeing one another, they nod their heads up and down three or four times, and at the same time expanding the frill or pouch beneath the throat; their eyes glisten with rage, and after waving their tails from side to side for a few seconds, as if to gather energy, they dart at each other furiously, rolling over and over, and holding firmly with their teeth. the conflict generally ends in one of the combatants losing his tail, which is often devoured by the victor." the male of this species is considerably larger than the female (65. mr. n.l. austen kept these animals alive for a considerable time; see 'land and water,' july 1867, p. 9.); and this, as far as dr. gunther has been able to ascertain, is the general rule with lizards of all kinds. the male alone of the cyrtodactylus rubidus of the andaman islands possesses pre-anal pores; and these pores, judging from analogy, probably serve to emit an odour. (66. stoliczka, 'journal of the asiatic society of bengal,' vol. xxxiv. 1870, p. 166.) [fig.33. sitana minor. male with the gular pouch expanded (from gunther's 'reptiles of india')'] the sexes often differ greatly in various external characters. the male of the above-mentioned anolis is furnished with a crest which runs along the back and tail, and can be erected at pleasure; but of this crest the female does not exhibit a trace. in the indian cophotis ceylanica, the female has a dorsal crest, though much less developed than in the male; and so it is, as dr. gunther informs me, with the females of many iguanas, chameleons, and other lizards. in some species, however, the crest is equally developed in both sexes, as in the iguana tuberculata. in the genus sitana, the males alone are furnished with a large throat pouch (fig. 33), which can be folded up like a fan, and is coloured blue, black, and red; but these splendid colours are exhibited only during the pairing-season. the female does not possess even a rudiment of this appendage. in the anolis cristatellus, according to mr. austen, the throat pouch, which is bright red marbled with yellow, is present in the female, though in a rudimental condition. again, in certain other lizards, both sexes are equally well provided with throat pouches. here we see with species belonging to the same group, as in so many previous cases, the same character either confined to the males, or more largely developed in them than in the females, or again equally developed in both sexes. the little lizards of the genus draco, which glide through the air on their rib- supported parachutes, and which in the beauty of their colours baffle description, are furnished with skinny appendages to the throat "like the wattles of gallinaceous birds." these become erected when the animal is excited. they occur in both sexes, but are best developed when the male arrives at maturity, at which age the middle appendage is sometimes twice as long as the head. most of the species likewise have a low crest running along the neck; and this is much more developed in the full-grown males than in the females or young males. (67. all the foregoing statements and quotations, in regard to cophotis, sitana and draco, as well as the following facts in regard to ceratophora and chamaeleon, are from dr. gunther himself, or from his magnificent work on the 'reptiles of british india,' ray soc., 1864, pp. 122, 130, 135.) a chinese species is said to live in pairs during the spring; "and if one is caught, the other falls from the tree to the ground, and allows itself to be captured with impunity"--i presume from despair. (68. mr. swinhoe, 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1870, p. 240.) [fig. 34. ceratophora stoddartii. upper figure; lower figure, female.] there are other and much more remarkable differences between the sexes of certain lizards. the male of ceratophora aspera bears on the extremity of his snout an appendage half as long as the head. it is cylindrical, covered with scales, flexible, and apparently capable of erection: in the female it is quite rudimental. in a second species of the same genus a terminal scale forms a minute horn on the summit of the flexible appendage; and in a third species (c. stoddartii, fig. 34) the whole appendage is converted into a horn, which is usually of a white colour, but assumes a purplish tint when the animal is excited. in the adult male of this latter species the horn is half an inch in length, but it is of quite minute size in the female and in the young. these appendages, as dr. gunther has remarked to me, may be compared with the combs of gallinaceous birds, and apparently serve as ornaments. [fig. 35. chamaeleo bifurcus. upper figure, male; lower figure, female. fig. 36. chamaeleo owenii. upper figure, male; lower figure, female.] in the genus chamaeleon we come to the acme of difference between the sexes. the upper part of the skull of the male c. bifurcus (fig. 35), an inhabitant of madagascar, is produced into two great, solid, bony projections, covered with scales like the rest of the head; and of this wonderful modification of structure the female exhibits only a rudiment. again, in chamaeleo owenii (fig. 36), from the west coast of africa, the male bears on his snout and forehead three curious horns, of which the female has not a trace. these horns consist of an excrescence of bone covered with a smooth sheath, forming part of the general integuments of the body, so that they are identical in structure with those of a bull, goat, or other sheath-horned ruminant. although the three horns differ so much in appearance from the two great prolongations of the skull in c. bifurcus, we can hardly doubt that they serve the same general purpose in the economy of these two animals. the first conjecture, which will occur to every one, is that they are used by the males for fighting together; and as these animals are very quarrelsome (69. dr. buchholz, 'monatsbericht k. preuss. akad.' jan. 1874, p. 78.), this is probably a correct view. mr. t.w. wood also informs me that he once watched two individuals of c. pumilus fighting violently on the branch of a tree; they flung their heads about and tried to bite each other; they then rested for a time and afterwards continued their battle. with many lizards the sexes differ slightly in colour, the tints and stripes of the males being brighter and more distinctly defined than in the females. this, for instance, is the case with the above cophotis and with the acanthodactylus capensis of s. africa. in a cordylus of the latter country, the male is either much redder or greener than the female. in the indian calotes nigrilabris there is a still greater difference; the lips also of the male are black, whilst those of the female are green. in our common little viviparous lizard (zootoca vivipara) "the under side of the body and base of the tail in the male are bright orange, spotted with black; in the female these parts are pale-greyish-green without spots." (70. bell, 'history of british reptiles,' 2nd ed., 1849, p. 40.) we have seen that the males alone of sitana possess a throat-pouch; and this is splendidly tinted with blue, black, and red. in the proctotretus tenuis of chile the male alone is marked with spots of blue, green, and coppery-red. (71. for proctotretus, see 'zoology of the voyage of the "beagle"; reptiles,' by mr. bell, p. 8. for the lizards of s. africa, see 'zoology of s. africa: reptiles,' by sir andrew smith, pl. 25 and 39. for the indian calotes, see 'reptiles of british india,' by dr. gunther, p. 143.) in many cases the males retain the same colours throughout the year, but in others they become much brighter during the breeding-season; i may give as an additional instance the calotes maria, which at this season has a bright red head, the rest of the body being green. (72. gunther in 'proceedings, zoological society,' 1870, p. 778, with a coloured figure.) both sexes of many species are beautifully coloured exactly alike; and there is no reason to suppose that such colours are protective. no doubt with the bright green kinds which live in the midst of vegetation, this colour serves to conceal them; and in n. patagonia i saw a lizard (proctotretus multimaculatus) which, when frightened, flattened its body, closed its eyes, and then from its mottled tints was hardly distinguishable from the surrounding sand. but the bright colours with which so many lizards are ornamented, as well as their various curious appendages, were probably acquired by the males as an attraction, and then transmitted either to their male offspring alone, or to both sexes. sexual selection, indeed, seems to have played almost as important a part with reptiles as with birds; and the less conspicuous colours of the females in comparison with the males cannot be accounted for, as mr. wallace believes to be the case with birds, by the greater exposure of the females to danger during incubation. chapter xiii. secondary sexual characters of birds. sexual differences--law of battle--special weapons--vocal organs-- instrumental music--love-antics and dances--decorations, permanent and seasonal--double and single annual moults--display of ornaments by the males. secondary sexual characters are more diversified and conspicuous in birds, though not perhaps entailing more important changes of structure, than in any other class of animals. i shall, therefore, treat the subject at considerable length. male birds sometimes, though rarely, possess special weapons for fighting with each other. they charm the female by vocal or instrumental music of the most varied kinds. they are ornamented by all sorts of combs, wattles, protuberances, horns, air-distended sacks, top- knots, naked shafts, plumes and lengthened feathers gracefully springing from all parts of the body. the beak and naked skin about the head, and the feathers, are often gorgeously coloured. the males sometimes pay their court by dancing, or by fantastic antics performed either on the ground or in the air. in one instance, at least, the male emits a musky odour, which we may suppose serves to charm or excite the female; for that excellent observer, mr. ramsay (1. 'ibis,' vol. iii. (new series), 1867, p. 414.), says of the australian musk-duck (biziura lobata) that "the smell which the male emits during the summer months is confined to that sex, and in some individuals is retained throughout the year; i have never, even in the breeding-season, shot a female which had any smell of musk." so powerful is this odour during the pairing-season, that it can be detected long before the bird can be seen. (2. gould, 'handbook of the birds of australia,' 1865, vol. ii. p. 383.) on the whole, birds appear to be the most aesthetic of all animals, excepting of course man, and they have nearly the same taste for the beautiful as we have. this is shewn by our enjoyment of the singing of birds, and by our women, both civilised and savage, decking their heads with borrowed plumes, and using gems which are hardly more brilliantly coloured than the naked skin and wattles of certain birds. in man, however, when cultivated, the sense of beauty is manifestly a far more complex feeling, and is associated with various intellectual ideas. before treating of the sexual characters with which we are here more particularly concerned, i may just allude to certain differences between the sexes which apparently depend on differences in their habits of life; for such cases, though common in the lower, are rare in the higher classes. two humming-birds belonging to the genus eustephanus, which inhabit the island of juan fernandez, were long thought to be specifically distinct, but are now known, as mr. gould informs me, to be the male and female of the same species, and they differ slightly in the form of the beak. in another genus of humming-birds (grypus), the beak of the male is serrated along the margin and hooked at the extremity, thus differing much from that of the female. in the neomorpha of new zealand, there is, as we have seen, a still wider difference in the form of the beak in relation to the manner of feeding of the two sexes. something of the same kind has been observed with the goldfinch (carduelis elegans), for i am assured by mr. j. jenner weir that the bird-catchers can distinguish the males by their slightly longer beaks. the flocks of males are often found feeding on the seeds of the teazle (dipsacus), which they can reach with their elongated beaks, whilst the females more commonly feed on the seeds of the betony or scrophularia. with a slight difference of this kind as a foundation, we can see how the beaks of the two sexes might be made to differ greatly through natural selection. in some of the above cases, however, it is possible that the beaks of the males may have been first modified in relation to their contests with other males; and that this afterwards led to slightly changed habits of life. law of battle. almost all male birds are extremely pugnacious, using their beaks, wings, and legs for fighting together. we see this every spring with our robins and sparrows. the smallest of all birds, namely the humming-bird, is one of the most quarrelsome. mr. gosse (3. quoted by mr. gould, 'introduction to the trochilidae,' 1861, page 29.) describes a battle in which a pair seized hold of each other's beaks, and whirled round and round, till they almost fell to the ground; and m. montes de oca, in speaking or another genus of humming-bird, says that two males rarely meet without a fierce aerial encounter: when kept in cages "their fighting has mostly ended in the splitting of the tongue of one of the two, which then surely dies from being unable to feed." (4. gould, ibid. p. 52.) with waders, the males of the common water-hen (gallinula chloropus) "when pairing, fight violently for the females: they stand nearly upright in the water and strike with their feet." two were seen to be thus engaged for half an hour, until one got hold of the head of the other, which would have been killed had not the observer interfered; the female all the time looking on as a quiet spectator. (5. w. thompson, 'natural history of ireland: birds,' vol. ii. 1850, p. 327.) mr. blyth informs me that the males of an allied bird (gallicrex cristatus) are a third larger than the females, and are so pugnacious during the breeding-season that they are kept by the natives of eastern bengal for the sake of fighting. various other birds are kept in india for the same purpose, for instance, the bulbuls (pycnonotus hoemorrhous) which "fight with great spirit." (6. jerdon, 'birds of india,' 1863, vol. ii. p. 96.) [fig. 37. the ruff or machetes pugnax (from brehm's 'thierleben').] the polygamous ruff (machetes pugnax, fig. 37) is notorious for his extreme pugnacity; and in the spring, the males, which are considerably larger than the females, congregate day after day at a particular spot, where the females propose to lay their eggs. the fowlers discover these spots by the turf being trampled somewhat bare. here they fight very much like game- cocks, seizing each other with their beaks and striking with their wings. the great ruff of feathers round the neck is then erected, and according to col. montagu "sweeps the ground as a shield to defend the more tender parts"; and this is the only instance known to me in the case of birds of any structure serving as a shield. the ruff of feathers, however, from its varied and rich colours probably serves in chief part as an ornament. like most pugnacious birds, they seem always ready to fight, and when closely confined, often kill each other; but montagu observed that their pugnacity becomes greater during the spring, when the long feathers on their necks are fully developed; and at this period the least movement by any one bird provokes a general battle. (7. macgillivray, 'history of british birds,' vol. iv. 1852, pp. 177-181.) of the pugnacity of web-footed birds, two instances will suffice: in guiana "bloody fights occur during the breeding-season between the males of the wild musk-duck (cairina moschata); and where these fights have occurred the river is covered for some distance with feathers." (8. sir r. schomburgk, in 'journal of royal geographic society,' vol. xiii. 1843, p. 31.) birds which seem ill-adapted for fighting engage in fierce conflicts; thus the stronger males of the pelican drive away the weaker ones, snapping with their huge beaks and giving heavy blows with their wings. male snipe fight together, "tugging and pushing each other with their bills in the most curious manner imaginable." some few birds are believed never to fight; this is the case, according to audubon, with one of the woodpeckers of the united states (picu sauratus), although "the hens are followed by even half a dozen of their gay suitors." (9. 'ornithological biography,' vol. i. p. 191. for pelicans and snipes, see vol. iii. pp. 138, 477.) the males of many birds are larger than the females, and this no doubt is the result of the advantage gained by the larger and stronger males over their rivals during many generations. the difference in size between the two sexes is carried to an extreme point in several australian species; thus the male musk-duck (biziura), and the male cincloramphus cruralis (allied to our pipits) are by measurement actually twice as large as their respective females. (10. gould, 'handbook of birds of australia,' vol. i. p. 395; vol. ii. p. 383.) with many other birds the females are larger than the males; and, as formerly remarked, the explanation often given, namely, that the females have most of the work in feeding their young, will not suffice. in some few cases, as we shall hereafter see, the females apparently have acquired their greater size and strength for the sake of conquering other females and obtaining possession of the males. the males of many gallinaceous birds, especially of the polygamous kinds, are furnished with special weapons for fighting with their rivals, namely spurs, which can be used with fearful effect. it has been recorded by a trustworthy writer (11. mr. hewitt, in the 'poultry book' by tegetmeier, 1866, p. 137.) that in derbyshire a kite struck at a game-hen accompanied by her chickens, when the cock rushed to the rescue, and drove his spur right through the eye and skull of the aggressor. the spur was with difficulty drawn from the skull, and as the kite, though dead, retained his grasp, the two birds were firmly locked together; but the cock when disentangled was very little injured. the invincible courage of the game- cock is notorious: a gentleman who long ago witnessed the brutal scene, told me that a bird had both its legs broken by some accident in the cockpit, and the owner laid a wager that if the legs could be spliced so that the bird could stand upright, he would continue fighting. this was effected on the spot, and the bird fought with undaunted courage until he received his death-stroke. in ceylon a closely allied, wild species, the gallus stanleyi, is known to fight desperately "in defence of his seraglio," so that one of the combatants is frequently found dead. (12. layard, 'annals and magazine of natural history,' vol. xiv. 1854, p. 63.) an indian partridge (ortygornis gularis), the male of which is furnished with strong and sharp spurs, is so quarrelsome "that the scars of former fights disfigure the breast of almost every bird you kill." (13. jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. iii. p. 574.) the males of almost all gallinaceous birds, even those which are not furnished with spurs, engage during the breeding-season in fierce conflicts. the capercailzie and black-cock (tetrao urogallus and t. tetrix), which are both polygamists, have regular appointed places, where during many weeks they congregate in numbers to fight together and to display their charms before the females. dr. w. kovalevsky informs me that in russia he has seen the snow all bloody on the arenas where the capercailzie have fought; and the black-cocks "make the feathers fly in every direction," when several "engage in a battle royal." the elder brehm gives a curious account of the balz, as the love-dances and love-songs of the black-cock are called in germany. the bird utters almost continuously the strangest noises: "he holds his tail up and spreads it out like a fan, he lifts up his head and neck with all the feathers erect, and stretches his wings from the body. then he takes a few jumps in different directions, sometimes in a circle, and presses the under part of his beak so hard against the ground that the chin feathers are rubbed off. during these movements he beats his wings and turns round and round. the more ardent he grows the more lively he becomes, until at last the bird appears like a frantic creature." at such times the black-cocks are so absorbed that they become almost blind and deaf, but less so than the capercailzie: hence bird after bird may be shot on the same spot, or even caught by the hand. after performing these antics the males begin to fight: and the same black-cock, in order to prove his strength over several antagonists, will visit in the course of one morning several balz-places, which remain the same during successive years. (14. brehm, 'thierleben,' 1867, b. iv. s. 351. some of the foregoing statements are taken from l. lloyd, 'the game birds of sweden,' etc., 1867, p. 79.) the peacock with his long train appears more like a dandy than a warrior, but he sometimes engages in fierce contests: the rev. w. darwin fox informs me that at some little distance from chester two peacocks became so excited whilst fighting, that they flew over the whole city, still engaged, until they alighted on the top of st. john's tower. the spur, in those gallinaceous birds which are thus provided, is generally single; but polyplectron (fig. 51) has two or more on each leg; and one of the blood-pheasants (ithaginis cruentus) has been seen with five spurs. the spurs are generally confined to the male, being represented by mere knobs or rudiments in the female; but the females of the java peacock (pavo muticus) and, as i am informed by mr. blyth, of the small fire-backed pheasant (euplocamus erythrophthalmus) possess spurs. in galloperdix it is usual for the males to have two spurs, and for the females to have only one on each leg. (15. jerdon, 'birds of india': on ithaginis, vol. iii. p. 523; on galloperdix, p. 541.) hence spurs may be considered as a masculine structure, which has been occasionally more or less transferred to the females. like most other secondary sexual characters, the spurs are highly variable, both in number and development, in the same species. [fig.38. palamedea cornuta (from brehm), shewing the double wing-spurs, and the filament on the head.] various birds have spurs on their wings. but the egyptian goose (chenalopex aegyptiacus) has only "bare obtuse knobs," and these probably shew us the first steps by which true spurs have been developed in other species. in the spur-winged goose, plectropterus gambensis, the males have much larger spurs than the females; and they use them, as i am informed by mr. bartlett, in fighting together, so that, in this case, the wing-spurs serve as sexual weapons; but according to livingstone, they are chiefly used in the defence of the young. the palamedea (fig. 38) is armed with a pair of spurs on each wing; and these are such formidable weapons that a single blow has been known to drive a dog howling away. but it does not appear that the spurs in this case, or in that of some of the spur-winged rails, are larger in the male than in the female. (16. for the egyptian goose, see macgillivray, 'british birds,' vol. iv. p. 639. for plectropterus, livingstone's 'travels,' p. 254. for palamedea, brehm's 'thierleben,' b. iv. s. 740. see also on this bird azara, 'voyages dans l'amerique merid.' tom. iv. 1809, pp. 179, 253.) in certain plovers, however, the wing-spurs must be considered as a sexual character. thus in the male of our common peewit (vanellus cristatus) the tubercle on the shoulder of the wing becomes more prominent during the breeding-season, and the males fight together. in some species of lobivanellus a similar tubercle becomes developed during the breeding-season "into a short horny spur." in the australian l. lobatus both sexes have spurs, but these are much larger in the males than in the females. in an allied bird, the hoplopterus armatus, the spurs do not increase in size during the breeding- season; but these birds have been seen in egypt to fight together, in the same manner as our peewits, by turning suddenly in the air and striking sideways at each other, sometimes with fatal results. thus also they drive away other enemies. (17. see, on our peewit, mr. r. carr in 'land and water,' aug. 8th, 1868, p. 46. in regard to lobivanellus, see jerdon's 'birds of india,' vol. iii. p. 647, and gould's 'handbook of birds of australia,' vol. ii. p. 220. for the hoplopterus, see mr. allen in the 'ibis,' vol. v. 1863, p. 156.) the season of love is that of battle; but the males of some birds, as of the game-fowl and ruff, and even the young males of the wild turkey and grouse (18. audubon, 'ornithological biography,' vol. ii. p. 492; vol. i. pp. 4-13.), are ready to fight whenever they meet. the presence of the female is the teterrima belli causa. the bengali baboos make the pretty little males of the amadavat (estrelda amandava) fight together by placing three small cages in a row, with a female in the middle; after a little time the two males are turned loose, and immediately a desperate battle ensues. (19. mr. blyth, 'land and water,' 1867, p. 212.) when many males congregate at the same appointed spot and fight together, as in the case of grouse and various other birds, they are generally attended by the females (20. richardson on tetrao umbellus, 'fauna bor. amer.: birds,' 1831, p. 343. l. lloyd, 'game birds of sweden,' 1867, pp. 22, 79, on the capercailzie and black-cock. brehm, however, asserts ('thierleben,' b. iv. s. 352) that in germany the grey-hens do not generally attend the balzen of the black-cocks, but this is an exception to the common rule; possibly the hens may lie hidden in the surrounding bushes, as is known to be the case with the gray-hens in scandinavia, and with other species in n. america.), which afterwards pair with the victorious combatants. but in some cases the pairing precedes instead of succeeding the combat: thus according to audubon (21. 'ornithological biography,' vol. ii. p. 275.), several males of the virginian goat-sucker (caprimulgus virgianus) "court, in a highly entertaining manner the female, and no sooner has she made her choice, than her approved gives chase to all intruders, and drives them beyond his dominions." generally the males try to drive away or kill their rivals before they pair. it does not, however, appear that the females invariably prefer the victorious males. i have indeed been assured by dr. w. kovalevsky that the female capercailzie sometimes steals away with a young male who has not dared to enter the arena with the older cocks, in the same manner as occasionally happens with the does of the red-deer in scotland. when two males contend in presence of a single female, the victor, no doubt, commonly gains his desire; but some of these battles are caused by wandering males trying to distract the peace of an already mated pair. (22. brehm, 'thierleben,' etc., b. iv. 1867, p. 990. audubon, 'ornithological biography,' vol. ii. p. 492.) even with the most pugnacious species it is probable that the pairing does not depend exclusively on the mere strength and courage of the male; for such males are generally decorated with various ornaments, which often become more brilliant during the breeding-season, and which are sedulously displayed before the females. the males also endeavour to charm or excite their mates by love-notes, songs, and antics; and the courtship is, in many instances, a prolonged affair. hence it is not probable that the females are indifferent to the charms of the opposite sex, or that they are invariably compelled to yield to the victorious males. it is more probable that the females are excited, either before or after the conflict, by certain males, and thus unconsciously prefer them. in the case of tetrao umbellus, a good observer (23. 'land and water,' july 25, 1868, p. 14.) goes so far as to believe that the battles of the male "are all a sham, performed to show themselves to the greatest advantage before the admiring females who assemble around; for i have never been able to find a maimed hero, and seldom more than a broken feather." i shall have to recur to this subject, but i may here add that with the tetrao cupido of the united states, about a score of males assemble at a particular spot, and, strutting about, make the whole air resound with their extraordinary noises. at the first answer from a female the males begin to fight furiously, and the weaker give way; but then, according to audubon, both the victors and vanquished search for the female, so that the females must either then exert a choice, or the battle must be renewed. so, again, with one of the field-starlings of the united states (sturnella ludoviciana) the males engage in fierce conflicts, "but at the sight of a female they all fly after her as if mad." (24. audubon's 'ornithological biography;' on tetrao cupido, vol. ii. p. 492; on the sturnus, vol. ii. p. 219.) vocal and instrumental music. with birds the voice serves to express various emotions, such as distress, fear, anger, triumph, or mere happiness. it is apparently sometimes used to excite terror, as in the case of the hissing noise made by some nestling-birds. audubon (25. 'ornithological biography,' vol. v. p. 601.), relates that a night-heron (ardea nycticorax, linn.), which he kept tame, used to hide itself when a cat approached, and then "suddenly start up uttering one of the most frightful cries, apparently enjoying the cat's alarm and flight." the common domestic cock clucks to the hen, and the hen to her chickens, when a dainty morsel is found. the hen, when she has laid an egg, "repeats the same note very often, and concludes with the sixth above, which she holds for a longer time" (26. the hon. daines barrington, 'philosophical transactions,' 1773, p. 252.); and thus she expresses her joy. some social birds apparently call to each other for aid; and as they flit from tree to tree, the flock is kept together by chirp answering chirp. during the nocturnal migrations of geese and other water-fowl, sonorous clangs from the van may be heard in the darkness overhead, answered by clangs in the rear. certain cries serve as danger signals, which, as the sportsman knows to his cost, are understood by the same species and by others. the domestic cock crows, and the humming-bird chirps, in triumph over a defeated rival. the true song, however, of most birds and various strange cries are chiefly uttered during the breeding- season, and serve as a charm, or merely as a call-note, to the other sex. naturalists are much divided with respect to the object of the singing of birds. few more careful observers ever lived than montagu, and he maintained that the "males of song-birds and of many others do not in general search for the female, but, on the contrary, their business in the spring is to perch on some conspicuous spot, breathing out their full and amorous notes, which, by instinct, the female knows, and repairs to the spot to choose her mate." (27. 'ornithological dictionary,' 1833, p. 475.) mr. jenner weir informs me that this is certainly the case with the nightingale. bechstein, who kept birds during his whole life, asserts, "that the female canary always chooses the best singer, and that in a state of nature the female finch selects that male out of a hundred whose notes please her most. (28. 'naturgeschichte der stubenvögel,' 1840, s. 4. mr. harrison weir likewise writes to me:--"i am informed that the best singing males generally get a mate first, when they are bred in the same room.") there can be no doubt that birds closely attend to each other's song. mr. weir has told me of the case of a bullfinch which had been taught to pipe a german waltz, and who was so good a performer that he cost ten guineas; when this bird was first introduced into a room where other birds were kept and he began to sing, all the others, consisting of about twenty linnets and canaries, ranged themselves on the nearest side of their cages, and listened with the greatest interest to the new performer. many naturalists believe that the singing of birds is almost exclusively "the effect of rivalry and emulation," and not for the sake of charming their mates. this was the opinion of daines barrington and white of selborne, who both especially attended to this subject. (29. 'philosophical transactions,' 1773, p. 263. white's 'natural history of selborne,' 1825, vol. i. p. 246.) barrington, however, admits that "superiority in song gives to birds an amazing ascendancy over others, as is well known to bird- catchers." it is certain that there is an intense degree of rivalry between the males in their singing. bird-fanciers match their birds to see which will sing longest; and i was told by mr. yarrell that a first-rate bird will sometimes sing till he drops down almost dead, or according to bechstein (30. 'naturgesch. der stubenvögel,' 1840, s. 252.), quite dead from rupturing a vessel in the lungs. whatever the cause may be, male birds, as i hear from mr. weir, often die suddenly during the season of song. that the habit of singing is sometimes quite independent of love is clear, for a sterile, hybrid canary-bird has been described (31. mr. bold, 'zoologist,' 1843-44, p. 659.) as singing whilst viewing itself in a mirror, and then dashing at its own image; it likewise attacked with fury a female canary, when put into the same cage. the jealousy excited by the act of singing is constantly taken advantage of by bird-catchers; a male, in good song, is hidden and protected, whilst a stuffed bird, surrounded by limed twigs, is exposed to view. in this manner, as mr. weir informs me, a man has in the course of a single day caught fifty, and in one instance, seventy, male chaffinches. the power and inclination to sing differ so greatly with birds that although the price of an ordinary male chaffinch is only sixpence, mr. weir saw one bird for which the bird-catcher asked three pounds; the test of a really good singer being that it will continue to sing whilst the cage is swung round the owner's head. that male birds should sing from emulation as well as for charming the female, is not at all incompatible; and it might have been expected that these two habits would have concurred, like those of display and pugnacity. some authors, however, argue that the song of the male cannot serve to charm the female, because the females of some few species, such as of the canary, robin, lark, and bullfinch, especially when in a state of widowhood, as bechstein remarks, pour forth fairly melodious strains. in some of these cases the habit of singing may be in part attributed to the females having been highly fed and confined (32. d. barrington, 'philosophical transactions,' 1773, p. 262. bechstein, 'stubenvögel,' 1840, s. 4.), for this disturbs all the functions connected with the reproduction of the species. many instances have already been given of the partial transference of secondary masculine characters to the female, so that it is not at all surprising that the females of some species should possess the power of song. it has also been argued, that the song of the male cannot serve as a charm, because the males of certain species, for instance of the robin, sing during the autumn. (33. this is likewise the case with the water-ouzel; see mr. hepburn in the 'zoologist,' 1845-46, p. 1068.) but nothing is more common than for animals to take pleasure in practising whatever instinct they follow at other times for some real good. how often do we see birds which fly easily, gliding and sailing through the air obviously for pleasure? the cat plays with the captured mouse, and the cormorant with the captured fish. the weaver-bird (ploceus), when confined in a cage, amuses itself by neatly weaving blades of grass between the wires of its cage. birds which habitually fight during the breeding-season are generally ready to fight at all times; and the males of the capercailzie sometimes hold their balzen or leks at the usual place of assemblage during the autumn. (34. l. lloyd, 'game birds of sweden,' 1867, p. 25.) hence it is not at all surprising that male birds should continue singing for their own amusement after the season for courtship is over. as shewn in a previous chapter, singing is to a certain extent an art, and is much improved by practice. birds can be taught various tunes, and even the unmelodious sparrow has learnt to sing like a linnet. they acquire the song of their foster parents (35. barrington, ibid. p. 264, bechstein, ibid. s. 5.), and sometimes that of their neighbours. (36. dureau de la malle gives a curious instance ('annales des sc. nat.' 3rd series, zoolog., tom. x. p. 118) of some wild blackbirds in his garden in paris, which naturally learnt a republican air from a caged bird.) all the common songsters belong to the order of insessores, and their vocal organs are much more complex than those of most other birds; yet it is a singular fact that some of the insessores, such as ravens, crows, and magpies, possess the proper apparatus (37. bishop, in 'todd's cyclopaedia of anatomy and physiology,' vol. iv. p. 1496.), though they never sing, and do not naturally modulate their voices to any great extent. hunter asserts (38. as stated by barrington in 'philosophical transactions,' 1773, p. 262.) that with the true songsters the muscles of the larynx are stronger in the males than in the females; but with this slight exception there is no difference in the vocal organs of the two sexes, although the males of most species sing so much better and more continuously than the females. it is remarkable that only small birds properly sing. the australian genus menura, however, must be excepted; for the menura alberti, which is about the size of a half-grown turkey, not only mocks other birds, but "its own whistle is exceedingly beautiful and varied." the males congregate and form "corroborying places," where they sing, raising and spreading their tails like peacocks, and drooping their wings. (39. gould, 'handbook to the birds of australia,' vol. i. 1865, pp. 308-310. see also mr. t.w. wood in the 'student,' april 1870, p. 125.) it is also remarkable that birds which sing well are rarely decorated with brilliant colours or other ornaments. of our british birds, excepting the bullfinch and goldfinch, the best songsters are plain-coloured. the kingfisher, bee-eater, roller, hoopoe, woodpeckers, etc., utter harsh cries; and the brilliant birds of the tropics are hardly ever songsters. (40. see remarks to this effect in gould's 'introduction to the trochilidae,' 1861, p. 22.) hence bright colours and the power of song seem to replace each other. we can perceive that if the plumage did not vary in brightness, or if bright colours were dangerous to the species, other means would be employed to charm the females; and melody of voice offers one such means. [fig. 39. tetrao cupido: male. (t.w. wood.)] in some birds the vocal organs differ greatly in the two sexes. in the tetrao cupido (fig. 39) the male has two bare, orange-coloured sacks, one on each side of the neck; and these are largely inflated when the male, during the breeding-season, makes his curious hollow sound, audible at a great distance. audubon proved that the sound was intimately connected with this apparatus (which reminds us of the air-sacks on each side of the mouth of certain male frogs), for he found that the sound was much diminished when one of the sacks of a tame bird was pricked, and when both were pricked it was altogether stopped. the female has "a somewhat similar, though smaller naked space of skin on the neck; but this is not capable of inflation." (41. 'the sportsman and naturalist in canada,' by major w. ross king, 1866, pp. 144-146. mr. t.w. wood gives in the 'student' (april 1870, p. 116) an excellent account of the attitude and habits of this bird during its courtship. he states that the ear-tufts or neck-plumes are erected, so that they meet over the crown of the head. see his drawing, fig. 39.) the male of another kind of grouse (tetrao urophasianus), whilst courting the female, has his "bare yellow oesophagus inflated to a prodigious size, fully half as large as the body"; and he then utters various grating, deep, hollow tones. with his neck-feathers erect, his wings lowered, and buzzing on the ground, and his long pointed tail spread out like a fan, he displays a variety of grotesque attitudes. the oesophagus of the female is not in any way remarkable. (42. richardson, 'fauna bor. americana: birds,' 1831, p. 359. audubon, ibid. vol. iv. p. 507.) [fig. 40. the umbrella-bird or cephalopterus ornatus, male (from brehm).] it seems now well made out that the great throat pouch of the european male bustard (otis tarda), and of at least four other species, does not, as was formerly supposed, serve to hold water, but is connected with the utterance during the breeding-season of a peculiar sound resembling "oak." (43. the following papers have been lately written on this subject: prof. a. newton, in the 'ibis,' 1862, p. 107; dr. cullen, ibid. 1865, p. 145; mr. flower, in 'proc. zool. soc.' 1865, p. 747; and dr. murie, in 'proc. zool. soc.' 1868, p. 471. in this latter paper an excellent figure is given of the male australian bustard in full display with the sack distended. it is a singular fact that the sack is not developed in all the males of the same species.) a crow-like bird inhabiting south america (see cephalopterus ornatus, fig. 40) is called the umbrella-bird, from its immense top knot, formed of bare white quills surmounted by dark-blue plumes, which it can elevate into a great dome no less than five inches in diameter, covering the whole head. this bird has on its neck a long, thin, cylindrical fleshy appendage, which is thickly clothed with scale-like blue feathers. it probably serves in part as an ornament, but likewise as a resounding apparatus; for mr. bates found that it is connected "with an unusual development of the trachea and vocal organs." it is dilated when the bird utters its singularly deep, loud and long sustained fluty note. the head- crest and neck-appendage are rudimentary in the female. (44. bates, 'the naturalist on the amazons,' 1863, vol. ii. p. 284; wallace, in 'proceedings, zoological society,' 1850, p. 206. a new species, with a still larger neck-appendage (c. penduliger), has lately been discovered, see 'ibis,' vol. i. p. 457.) the vocal organs of various web-footed and wading birds are extraordinarily complex, and differ to a certain extent in the two sexes. in some cases the trachea is convoluted, like a french horn, and is deeply embedded in the sternum. in the wild swan (cygnus ferus) it is more deeply embedded in the adult male than in the adult female or young male. in the male merganser the enlarged portion of the trachea is furnished with an additional pair of muscles. (45. bishop, in todd's 'cyclopaedia of anatomy and physiology,' vol. iv. p. 1499.) in one of the ducks, however, namely anas punctata, the bony enlargement is only a little more developed in the male than in the female. (46. prof. newton, 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1871, p. 651.) but the meaning of these differences in the trachea of the two sexes of the anatidae is not understood; for the male is not always the more vociferous; thus with the common duck, the male hisses, whilst the female utters a loud quack. (47. the spoonbill (platalea) has its trachea convoluted into a figure of eight, and yet this bird (jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. iii. p. 763) is mute; but mr. blyth informs me that the convolutions are not constantly present, so that perhaps they are now tending towards abortion.) in both sexes of one of the cranes (grus virgo) the trachea penetrates the sternum, but presents "certain sexual modifications." in the male of the black stork there is also a well-marked sexual difference in the length and curvature of the bronchi. (48. 'elements of comparative anatomy,' by r. wagner, eng. translat. 1845, p. 111. with respect to the swan, as given above, yarrell's 'history of british birds,' 2nd edition, 1845, vol. iii. p. 193.) highly important structures have, therefore, in these cases been modified according to sex. it is often difficult to conjecture whether the many strange cries and notes uttered by male birds during the breeding-season serve as a charm or merely as a call to the female. the soft cooing of the turtle-dove and of many pigeons, it may be presumed, pleases the female. when the female of the wild turkey utters her call in the morning, the male answers by a note which differs from the gobbling noise made, when with erected feathers, rustling wings and distended wattles, he puffs and struts before her. (49. c.l. bonaparte, quoted in the 'naturalist library: birds,' vol. xiv. p. 126.) the spel of the black-cock certainly serves as a call to the female, for it has been known to bring four or five females from a distance to a male under confinement; but as the black-cock continues his spel for hours during successive days, and in the case of the capercailzie "with an agony of passion," we are led to suppose that the females which are present are thus charmed. (50. l. lloyd, 'the game birds of sweden,' etc., 1867, pp. 22, 81.) the voice of the common rook is known to alter during the breeding-season, and is therefore in some way sexual. (51. jenner, 'philosophical transactions,' 1824, p. 20.) but what shall we say about the harsh screams of, for instance, some kinds of macaws; have these birds as bad taste for musical sounds as they apparently have for colour, judging by the inharmonious contrast of their bright yellow and blue plumage? it is indeed possible that without any advantage being thus gained, the loud voices of many male birds may be the result of the inherited effects of the continued use of their vocal organs when excited by the strong passions of love, jealousy and rage; but to this point we shall recur when we treat of quadrupeds. we have as yet spoken only of the voice, but the males of various birds practise, during their courtship, what may be called instrumental music. peacocks and birds of paradise rattle their quills together. turkey-cocks scrape their wings against the ground, and some kinds of grouse thus produce a buzzing sound. another north american grouse, the tetrao umbellus, when with his tail erect, his ruffs displayed, "he shows off his finery to the females, who lie hid in the neighbourhood," drums by rapidly striking his wings together above his back, according to mr. r. haymond, and not, as audubon thought, by striking them against his sides. the sound thus produced is compared by some to distant thunder, and by others to the quick roll of a drum. the female never drums, "but flies directly to the place where the male is thus engaged." the male of the kalij-pheasant, in the himalayas, often makes a singular drumming noise with his wings, not unlike the sound produced by shaking a stiff piece of cloth." on the west coast of africa the little black-weavers (ploceus?) congregate in a small party on the bushes round a small open space, and sing and glide through the air with quivering wings, "which make a rapid whirring sound like a child's rattle." one bird after another thus performs for hours together, but only during the courting-season. at this season, and at no other time, the males of certain night-jars (caprimulgus) make a strange booming noise with their wings. the various species of woodpeckers strike a sonorous branch with their beaks, with so rapid a vibratory movement that "the head appears to be in two places at once." the sound thus produced is audible at a considerable distance but cannot be described; and i feel sure that its source would never be conjectured by any one hearing it for the first time. as this jarring sound is made chiefly during the breeding-season, it has been considered as a love-song; but it is perhaps more strictly a love- call. the female, when driven from her nest, has been observed thus to call her mate, who answered in the same manner and soon appeared. lastly, the male hoopoe (upupa epops) combines vocal and instrumental music; for during the breeding-season this bird, as mr. swinhoe observed, first draws in air, and then taps the end of its beak perpendicularly down against a stone or the trunk of a tree, "when the breath being forced down the tubular bill produces the correct sound." if the beak is not thus struck against some object, the sound is quite different. air is at the same time swallowed, and the oesophagus thus becomes much swollen; and this probably acts as a resonator, not only with the hoopoe, but with pigeons and other birds. (52. for the foregoing facts see, on birds of paradise, brehm, 'thierleben,' band iii. s. 325. on grouse, richardson, 'fauna bor. americ.: birds,' pp. 343 and 359; major w. ross king, 'the sportsman in canada,' 1866, p. 156; mr. haymond, in prof. cox's 'geol. survey of indiana,' p. 227; audubon, 'american ornitholog. biograph.' vol. i. p. 216. on the kalij-pheasant, jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. iii. p. 533. on the weavers, livingstone's 'expedition to the zambesi,' 1865, p. 425. on woodpeckers, macgillivray, 'hist. of british birds,' vol. iii. 1840, pp. 84, 88, 89, and 95. on the hoopoe, mr. swinhoe, in 'proc. zoolog. soc.' june 23, 1863 and 1871, p. 348. on the night-jar, audubon, ibid. vol. ii. p. 255, and 'american naturalist,' 1873, p. 672. the english night-jar likewise makes in the spring a curious noise during its rapid flight.) [fig. 41. outer tail-feather of scolopax gallinago (from 'proc. zool. soc.' 1858). fig. 42. outer tail-feather of scolopax frenata. fig. 43. outer tail-feather of scolopax javensis.] in the foregoing cases sounds are made by the aid of structures already present and otherwise necessary; but in the following cases certain feathers have been specially modified for the express purpose of producing sounds. the drumming, bleating, neighing, or thundering noise (as expressed by different observers) made by the common snipe (scolopax gallinago) must have surprised every one who has ever heard it. this bird, during the pairing-season, flies to "perhaps a thousand feet in height," and after zig-zagging about for a time descends to the earth in a curved line, with outspread tail and quivering pinions, and surprising velocity. the sound is emitted only during this rapid descent. no one was able to explain the cause until m. meves observed that on each side of the tail the outer feathers are peculiarly formed (fig. 41), having a stiff sabre-shaped shaft with the oblique barbs of unusual length, the outer webs being strongly bound together. he found that by blowing on these feathers, or by fastening them to a long thin stick and waving them rapidly through the air, he could reproduce the drumming noise made by the living bird. both sexes are furnished with these feathers, but they are generally larger in the male than in the female, and emit a deeper note. in some species, as in s. frenata (fig. 42), four feathers, and in s. javensis (fig. 43), no less than eight on each side of the tail are greatly modified. different tones are emitted by the feathers of the different species when waved through the air; and the scolopax wilsonii of the united states makes a switching noise whilst descending rapidly to the earth. (53. see m. meves' interesting paper in 'proc. zool. soc.' 1858, p. 199. for the habits of the snipe, macgillivray, 'history of british birds,' vol. iv. p. 371. for the american snipe, capt. blakiston, 'ibis,' vol. v. 1863, p. 131.) [fig. 44. primary wing-feather of a humming-bird, the selasphorus platycercus (from a sketch by mr. salvin). upper figure, that of male; lower figure, corresponding feather of female.] in the male of the chamaepetes unicolor (a large gallinaceous bird of america), the first primary wing-feather is arched towards the tip and is much more attenuated than in the female. in an allied bird, the penelope nigra, mr. salvin observed a male, which, whilst it flew downwards "with outstretched wings, gave forth a kind of crashing rushing noise," like the falling of a tree. (54. mr. salvin, in 'proceedings, zoological society,' 1867, p. 160. i am much indebted to this distinguished ornithologist for sketches of the feathers of the chamaepetes, and for other information.) the male alone of one of the indian bustards (sypheotides auritus) has its primary wing-feathers greatly acuminated; and the male of an allied species is known to make a humming noise whilst courting the female. (55. jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. iii. pp. 618, 621.) in a widely different group of birds, namely humming-birds, the males alone of certain kinds have either the shafts of their primary wing-feathers broadly dilated, or the webs abruptly excised towards the extremity. the male, for instance, of selasphorus platycercus, when adult, has the first primary wing-feather (fig. 44), thus excised. whilst flying from flower to flower he makes "a shrill, almost whistling noise" (56. gould, 'introduction to the trochilidae,' 1861, p. 49. salvin, 'proceedings, zoological society,' 1867, p. 160.); but it did not appear to mr. salvin that the noise was intentionally made. [fig. 45. secondary wing-feathers of pipra deliciosa (from mr. sclater, in 'proc. zool. soc.' 1860). the three upper feathers, a, b, c, from the male; the three lower corresponding feathers, d, e, f, from the female. a and d, fifth secondary wing-feather of male and female, upper surface. b and e, sixth secondary, upper surface. c and f, seventh secondary, lower surface.] lastly, in several species of a sub-genus of pipra or manakin, the males, as described by mr. sclater, have their secondary wing-feathers modified in a still more remarkable manner. in the brilliantly-coloured p. deliciosa the first three secondaries are thick-stemmed and curved towards the body; in the fourth and fifth (fig. 45, a) the change is greater; and in the sixth and seventh (b, c) the shaft "is thickened to an extraordinary degree, forming a solid horny lump." the barbs also are greatly changed in shape, in comparison with the corresponding feathers (d, e, f) in the female. even the bones of the wing, which support these singular feathers in the male, are said by mr. fraser to be much thickened. these little birds make an extraordinary noise, the first "sharp note being not unlike the crack of a whip." (57. sclater, in 'proceedings, zoological society,' 1860, p. 90, and in 'ibis,' vol. iv. 1862, p. 175. also salvin, in 'ibis,' 1860, p. 37.) the diversity of the sounds, both vocal and instrumental, made by the males of many birds during the breeding-season, and the diversity of the means for producing such sounds, are highly remarkable. we thus gain a high idea of their importance for sexual purposes, and are reminded of the conclusion arrived at as to insects. it is not difficult to imagine the steps by which the notes of a bird, primarily used as a mere call or for some other purpose, might have been improved into a melodious love song. in the case of the modified feathers, by which the drumming, whistling, or roaring noises are produced, we know that some birds during their courtship flutter, shake, or rattle their unmodified feathers together; and if the females were led to select the best performers, the males which possessed the strongest or thickest, or most attenuated feathers, situated on any part of the body, would be the most successful; and thus by slow degrees the feathers might be modified to almost any extent. the females, of course, would not notice each slight successive alteration in shape, but only the sounds thus produced. it is a curious fact that in the same class of animals, sounds so different as the drumming of the snipe's tail, the tapping of the woodpecker's beak, the harsh trumpet-like cry of certain water-fowl, the cooing of the turtle-dove, and the song of the nightingale, should all be pleasing to the females of the several species. but we must not judge of the tastes of distinct species by a uniform standard; nor must we judge by the standard of man's taste. even with man, we should remember what discordant noises, the beating of tom-toms and the shrill notes of reeds, please the ears of savages. sir s. baker remarks (58. 'the nile tributaries of abyssinia,' 1867, p. 203.), that "as the stomach of the arab prefers the raw meat and reeking liver taken hot from the animal, so does his ear prefer his equally coarse and discordant music to all other." love antics and dances. the curious love gestures of some birds have already been incidentally noticed; so that little need here be added. in northern america large numbers of a grouse, the tetrao phasianellus, meet every morning during the breeding-season on a selected level spot, and here they run round and round in a circle of about fifteen or twenty feet in diameter, so that the ground is worn quite bare, like a fairy-ring. in these partridge-dances, as they are called by the hunters, the birds assume the strangest attitudes, and run round, some to the left and some to the right. audubon describes the males of a heron (ardea herodias) as walking about on their long legs with great dignity before the females, bidding defiance to their rivals. with one of the disgusting carrion-vultures (cathartes jota) the same naturalist states that "the gesticulations and parade of the males at the beginning of the love-season are extremely ludicrous." certain birds perform their love-antics on the wing, as we have seen with the black african weaver, instead of on the ground. during the spring our little white-throat (sylvia cinerea) often rises a few feet or yards in the air above some bush, and "flutters with a fitful and fantastic motion, singing all the while, and then drops to its perch." the great english bustard throws himself into indescribably odd attitudes whilst courting the female, as has been figured by wolf. an allied indian bustard (otis bengalensis) at such times "rises perpendicularly into the air with a hurried flapping of his wings, raising his crest and puffing out the feathers of his neck and breast, and then drops to the ground;" he repeats this manoeuvre several times, at the same time humming in a peculiar tone. such females as happen to be near "obey this saltatory summons," and when they approach he trails his wings and spreads his tail like a turkey-cock. (59. for tetrao phasianellus, see richardson, 'fauna, bor. america,' p. 361, and for further particulars capt. blakiston, 'ibis,' 1863, p. 125. for the cathartes and ardea, audubon, 'ornithological biography,' vol. ii. p. 51, and vol. iii. p. 89. on the white-throat, macgillivray, 'history of british birds,' vol. ii. p. 354. on the indian bustard, jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. iii. p. 618.) [fig. 46. bower-bird, chlamydera maculata, with bower (from brehm).] but the most curious case is afforded by three allied genera of australian birds, the famous bower-birds,--no doubt the co-descendants of some ancient species which first acquired the strange instinct of constructing bowers for performing their love-antics. the bowers (fig. 46), which, as we shall hereafter see, are decorated with feathers, shells, bones, and leaves, are built on the ground for the sole purpose of courtship, for their nests are formed in trees. both sexes assist in the erection of the bowers, but the male is the principal workman. so strong is this instinct that it is practised under confinement, and mr. strange has described (60. gould, 'handbook to the birds of australia,' vol. i. pp. 444, 449, 455. the bower of the satin bower-bird may be seen in the zoological society's gardens, regent's park.) the habits of some satin bower-birds which he kept in an aviary in new south wales. "at times the male will chase the female all over the aviary, then go to the bower, pick up a gay feather or a large leaf, utter a curious kind of note, set all his feathers erect, run round the bower and become so excited that his eyes appear ready to start from his head; he continues opening first one wing then the other, uttering a low, whistling note, and, like the domestic cock, seems to be picking up something from the ground, until at last the female goes gently towards him." captain stokes has described the habits and "play-houses" of another species, the great bower-bird, which was seen "amusing itself by flying backwards and forwards, taking a shell alternately from each side, and carrying it through the archway in its mouth." these curious structures, formed solely as halls of assemblage, where both sexes amuse themselves and pay their court, must cost the birds much labour. the bower, for instance, of the fawn-breasted species, is nearly four feet in length, eighteen inches in height, and is raised on a thick platform of sticks. decoration. i will first discuss the cases in which the males are ornamented either exclusively or in a much higher degree than the females, and in a succeeding chapter those in which both sexes are equally ornamented, and finally the rare cases in which the female is somewhat more brightly- coloured than the male. as with the artificial ornaments used by savage and civilised men, so with the natural ornaments of birds, the head is the chief seat of decoration. (61. see remarks to this effect, on the 'feeling of beauty among animals,' by mr. j. shaw, in the 'athenaeum,' nov. 24th, 1866, p. 681.) the ornaments, as mentioned at the commencement of this chapter, are wonderfully diversified. the plumes on the front or back of the head consist of variously-shaped feathers, sometimes capable of erection or expansion, by which their beautiful colours are fully displayed. elegant ear-tufts (fig. 39) are occasionally present. the head is sometimes covered with velvety down, as with the pheasant; or is naked and vividly coloured. the throat, also, is sometimes ornamented with a beard, wattles, or caruncles. such appendages are generally brightly- coloured, and no doubt serve as ornaments, though not always ornamental in our eyes; for whilst the male is in the act of courting the female, they often swell and assume vivid tints, as in the male turkey. at such times the fleshy appendages about the head of the male tragopan pheasant (ceriornis temminckii) swell into a large lappet on the throat and into two horns, one on each side of the splendid top-knot; and these are then coloured of the most intense blue which i have ever beheld. (62. see dr. murie's account with coloured figures in 'proceedings, zoological society,' 1872, p. 730.) the african hornbill (bucorax abyssinicus) inflates the scarlet bladder-like wattle on its neck, and with its wings drooping and tail expanded "makes quite a grand appearance." (63. mr. monteiro, 'ibis,' vol. iv. 1862, p. 339.) even the iris of the eye is sometimes more brightly-coloured in the male than in the female; and this is frequently the case with the beak, for instance, in our common blackbird. in buceros corrugatus, the whole beak and immense casque are coloured more conspicuously in the male than in the female; and "the oblique grooves upon the sides of the lower mandible are peculiar to the male sex." (64. 'land and water,' 1868, p. 217.) the head, again, often supports fleshy appendages, filaments, and solid protuberances. these, if not common to both sexes, are always confined to the males. the solid protuberances have been described in detail by dr. w. marshall (65. 'ueber die schädelhöcker,' etc., 'niederland. archiv. fur zoologie,' b. i. heft 2, 1872.), who shews that they are formed either of cancellated bone coated with skin, or of dermal and other tissues. with mammals true horns are always supported on the frontal bones, but with birds various bones have been modified for this purpose; and in species of the same group the protuberances may have cores of bone, or be quite destitute of them, with intermediate gradations connecting these two extremes. hence, as dr. marshall justly remarks, variations of the most different kinds have served for the development through sexual selection of these ornamental appendages. elongated feathers or plumes spring from almost every part of the body. the feathers on the throat and breast are sometimes developed into beautiful ruffs and collars. the tail-feathers are frequently increased in length; as we see in the tail-coverts of the peacock, and in the tail itself of the argus pheasant. with the peacock even the bones of the tail have been modified to support the heavy tail- coverts. (66. dr. w. marshall, 'über den vogelschwanz,' ibid. b. i. heft 2, 1872.) the body of the argus is not larger than that of a fowl; yet the length from the end of the beak to the extremity of the tail is no less than five feet three inches (67. jardine's 'naturalist library: birds,' vol. xiv. p. 166.), and that of the beautifully ocellated secondary wing- feathers nearly three feet. in a small african night-jar (cosmetornis vexillarius) one of the primary wing-feathers, during the breeding-season, attains a length of twenty-six inches, whilst the bird itself is only ten inches in length. in another closely-allied genus of night-jars, the shafts of the elongated wing-feathers are naked, except at the extremity, where there is a disc. (68. sclater, in the 'ibis,' vol. vi. 1864, p. 114; livingstone, 'expedition to the zambesi,' 1865, p. 66.) again, in another genus of night-jars, the tail-feathers are even still more prodigiously developed. in general the feathers of the tail are more often elongated than those of the wings, as any great elongation of the latter impedes flight. we thus see that in closely-allied birds ornaments of the same kind have been gained by the males through the development of widely different feathers. it is a curious fact that the feathers of species belonging to very distinct groups have been modified in almost exactly the same peculiar manner. thus the wing-feathers in one of the above-mentioned night-jars are bare along the shaft, and terminate in a disc; or are, as they are sometimes called, spoon or racket-shaped. feathers of this kind occur in the tail of a motmot (eumomota superciliaris), of a king-fisher, finch, humming-bird, parrot, several indian drongos (dicrurus and edolius, in one of which the disc stands vertically), and in the tail of certain birds of paradise. in these latter birds, similar feathers, beautifully ocellated, ornament the head, as is likewise the case with some gallinaceous birds. in an indian bustard (sypheotides auritus) the feathers forming the ear- tufts, which are about four inches in length, also terminate in discs. (69. jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. iii. p. 620.) it is a most singular fact that the motmots, as mr. salvin has clearly shewn (70. 'proceedings, zoological society,' 1873, p. 429.), give to their tail feathers the racket-shape by biting off the barbs, and, further, that this continued mutilation has produced a certain amount of inherited effect. [fig. 47. paradisea papuana (t.w. wood).] again, the barbs of the feathers in various widely-distinct birds are filamentous or plumose, as with some herons, ibises, birds of paradise, and gallinaceae. in other cases the barbs disappear, leaving the shafts bare from end to end; and these in the tail of the paradisea apoda attain a length of thirty-four inches (71. wallace, in 'annals and magazine of natural history,' vol. xx. 1857, p. 416, and in his 'malay archipelago,' vol. ii. 1869, p. 390.): in p. papuana (fig. 47) they are much shorter and thin. smaller feathers when thus denuded appear like bristles, as on the breast of the turkey-cock. as any fleeting fashion in dress comes to be admired by man, so with birds a change of almost any kind in the structure or colouring of the feathers in the male appears to have been admired by the female. the fact of the feathers in widely distinct groups having been modified in an analogous manner no doubt depends primarily on all the feathers having nearly the same structure and manner of development, and consequently tending to vary in the same manner. we often see a tendency to analogous variability in the plumage of our domestic breeds belonging to distinct species. thus top-knots have appeared in several species. in an extinct variety of the turkey, the top-knot consisted of bare quills surmounted with plumes of down, so that they somewhat resembled the racket- shaped feathers above described. in certain breeds of the pigeon and fowl the feathers are plumose, with some tendency in the shafts to be naked. in the sebastopol goose the scapular feathers are greatly elongated, curled, or even spirally twisted, with the margins plumose. (72. see my work on 'the variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. i. pp. 289, 293.) in regard to colour, hardly anything need here be said, for every one knows how splendid are the tints of many birds, and how harmoniously they are combined. the colours are often metallic and iridescent. circular spots are sometimes surrounded by one or more differently shaded zones, and are thus converted into ocelli. nor need much be said on the wonderful difference between the sexes of many birds. the common peacock offers a striking instance. female birds of paradise are obscurely coloured and destitute of all ornaments, whilst the males are probably the most highly decorated of all birds, and in so many different ways that they must be seen to be appreciated. the elongated and golden-orange plumes which spring from beneath the wings of the paradisea apoda, when vertically erected and made to vibrate, are described as forming a sort of halo, in the centre of which the head "looks like a little emerald sun with its rays formed by the two plumes." (73. quoted from m. de lafresnaye in 'annals and mag. of natural history,' vol. xiii. 1854, p. 157: see also mr. wallace's much fuller account in vol. xx. 1857, p. 412, and in his 'malay archipelago.') in another most beautiful species the head is bald, "and of a rich cobalt blue, crossed by several lines of black velvety feathers." (74. wallace, 'the malay archipelago,' vol. ii. 1869, p. 405.) [fig. 48. lophornis ornatus, male and female (from brehm). fig. 49. spathura underwoodi, male and female (from brehm).] male humming-birds (figs. 48 and 49) almost vie with birds of paradise in their beauty, as every one will admit who has seen mr. gould's splendid volumes, or his rich collection. it is very remarkable in how many different ways these birds are ornamented. almost every part of their plumage has been taken advantage of, and modified; and the modifications have been carried, as mr. gould shewed me, to a wonderful extreme in some species belonging to nearly every sub-group. such cases are curiously like those which we see in our fancy breeds, reared by man for the sake of ornament; certain individuals originally varied in one character, and other individuals of the same species in other characters; and these have been seized on by man and much augmented--as shewn by the tail of the fantail- pigeon, the hood of the jacobin, the beak and wattle of the carrier, and so forth. the sole difference between these cases is that in the one, the result is due to man's selection, whilst in the other, as with humming- birds, birds of paradise, etc., it is due to the selection by the females of the more beautiful males. i will mention only one other bird, remarkable from the extreme contrast in colour between the sexes, namely the famous bell-bird (chasmorhynchus niveus) of s. america, the note of which can be distinguished at the distance of nearly three miles, and astonishes every one when first hearing it. the male is pure white, whilst the female is dusky-green; and white is a very rare colour in terrestrial species of moderate size and inoffensive habits. the male, also, as described by waterton, has a spiral tube, nearly three inches in length, which rises from the base of the beak. it is jet-black, dotted over with minute downy feathers. this tube can be inflated with air, through a communication with the palate; and when not inflated hangs down on one side. the genus consists of four species, the males of which are very distinct, whilst the females, as described by mr. sclater in a very interesting paper, closely resemble each other, thus offering an excellent instance of the common rule that within the same group the males differ much more from each other than do the females. in a second species (c. nudicollis) the male is likewise snow-white, with the exception of a large space of naked skin on the throat and round the eyes, which during the breeding-season is of a fine green colour. in a third species (c. tricarunculatus) the head and neck alone of the male are white, the rest of the body being chestnut-brown, and the male of this species is provided with three filamentous projections half as long as the body--one rising from the base of the beak, and the two others from the corners of the mouth. (75. mr. sclater, 'intellectual observer,' jan. 1867. waterton's 'wanderings,' p. 118. see also mr. salvin's interesting paper, with a plate, in the 'ibis,' 1865, p. 90.) the coloured plumage and certain other ornaments of the adult males are either retained for life, or are periodically renewed during the summer and breeding-season. at this same season the beak and naked skin about the head frequently change colour, as with some herons, ibises, gulls, one of the bell-birds just noticed, etc. in the white ibis, the cheeks, the inflatable skin of the throat, and the basal portion of the beak then become crimson. (76. 'land and water,' 1867, p. 394.) in one of the rails, gallicrex cristatus, a large red caruncle is developed during this period on the head of the male. so it is with a thin horny crest on the beak of one of the pelicans, p. erythrorhynchus; for, after the breeding- season, these horny crests are shed, like horns from the heads of stags, and the shore of an island in a lake in nevada was found covered with these curious exuviae. (77. mr. d.g. elliot, in 'proc. zool. soc.' 1869, p. 589.) changes of colour in the plumage according to the season depend, firstly on a double annual moult, secondly on an actual change of colour in the feathers themselves, and thirdly on their dull-coloured margins being periodically shed, or on these three processes more or less combined. the shedding of the deciduary margins may be compared with the shedding of their down by very young birds; for the down in most cases arises from the summits of the first true feathers. (78. nitzsch's 'pterylography,' edited by p.l. sclater, ray society, 1867, p. 14.) with respect to the birds which annually undergo a double moult, there are, firstly, some kinds, for instance snipes, swallow-plovers (glareolae), and curlews, in which the two sexes resemble each other, and do not change colour at any season. i do not know whether the winter plumage is thicker and warmer than the summer plumage, but warmth seems the most probable end attained of a double moult, where there is no change of colour. secondly, there are birds, for instance, certain species of totanus and other grallatores, the sexes of which resemble each other, but in which the summer and winter plumage differ slightly in colour. the difference, however, in these cases is so small that it can hardly be an advantage to them; and it may, perhaps, be attributed to the direct action of the different conditions to which the birds are exposed during the two seasons. thirdly, there are many other birds the sexes of which are alike, but which are widely different in their summer and winter plumage. fourthly, there are birds the sexes of which differ from each other in colour; but the females, though moulting twice, retain the same colours throughout the year, whilst the males undergo a change of colour, sometimes a great one, as with certain bustards. fifthly and lastly, there are birds the sexes of which differ from each other in both their summer and winter plumage; but the male undergoes a greater amount of change at each recurrent season than the female--of which the ruff (machetes pugnax) offers a good instance. with respect to the cause or purpose of the differences in colour between the summer and winter plumage, this may in some instances, as with the ptarmigan (79. the brown mottled summer plumage of the ptarmigan is of as much importance to it, as a protection, as the white winter plumage; for in scandinavia during the spring, when the snow has disappeared, this bird is known to suffer greatly from birds of prey, before it has acquired its summer dress: see wilhelm von wright, in lloyd, 'game birds of sweden,' 1867, p. 125.), serve during both seasons as a protection. when the difference between the two plumages is slight it may perhaps be attributed, as already remarked, to the direct action of the conditions of life. but with many birds there can hardly be a doubt that the summer plumage is ornamental, even when both sexes are alike. we may conclude that this is the case with many herons, egrets, etc., for they acquire their beautiful plumes only during the breeding-season. moreover, such plumes, top-knots, etc., though possessed by both sexes, are occasionally a little more developed in the male than in the female; and they resemble the plumes and ornaments possessed by the males alone of other birds. it is also known that confinement, by affecting the reproductive system of male birds, frequently checks the development of their secondary sexual characters, but has no immediate influence on any other characters; and i am informed by mr. bartlett that eight or nine specimens of the knot (tringa canutus) retained their unadorned winter plumage in the zoological gardens throughout the year, from which fact we may infer that the summer plumage, though common to both sexes, partakes of the nature of the exclusively masculine plumage of many other birds. (80. in regard to the previous statements on moulting, see, on snipes, etc., macgillivray, 'hist. brit. birds,' vol. iv. p. 371; on glareolae, curlews, and bustards, jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. iii. pp. 615, 630, 683; on totanus, ibid. p. 700; on the plumes of herons, ibid. p. 738, and macgillivray, vol. iv. pp. 435 and 444, and mr. stafford allen, in the 'ibis,' vol. v. 1863, p. 33.) from the foregoing facts, more especially from neither sex of certain birds changing colour during either annual moult, or changing so slightly that the change can hardly be of any service to them, and from the females of other species moulting twice yet retaining the same colours throughout the year, we may conclude that the habit of annually moulting twice has not been acquired in order that the male should assume an ornamental character during the breeding-season; but that the double moult, having been originally acquired for some distinct purpose, has subsequently been taken advantage of in certain cases for gaining a nuptial plumage. it appears at first sight a surprising circumstance that some closely- allied species should regularly undergo a double annual moult, and others only a single one. the ptarmigan, for instance, moults twice or even thrice in the year, and the blackcock only once: some of the splendidly coloured honey-suckers (nectariniae) of india and some sub-genera of obscurely coloured pipits (anthus) have a double, whilst others have only a single annual moult. (81. on the moulting of the ptarmigan, see gould's 'birds of great britain.' on the honey-suckers, jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. i. pp. 359, 365, 369. on the moulting of anthus, see blyth, in 'ibis,' 1867, p. 32.) but the gradations in the manner of moulting, which are known to occur with various birds, shew us how species, or whole groups, might have originally acquired their double annual moult, or having once gained the habit, have again lost it. with certain bustards and plovers the vernal moult is far from complete, some feathers being renewed, and some changed in colour. there is also reason to believe that with certain bustards and rail-like birds, which properly undergo a double moult, some of the older males retain their nuptial plumage throughout the year. a few highly modified feathers may merely be added during the spring to the plumage, as occurs with the disc-formed tail-feathers of certain drongos (bhringa) in india, and with the elongated feathers on the back, neck, and crest of certain herons. by such steps as these, the vernal moult might be rendered more and more complete, until a perfect double moult was acquired. some of the birds of paradise retain their nuptial feathers throughout the year, and thus have only a single moult; others cast them directly after the breeding-season, and thus have a double moult; and others again cast them at this season during the first year, but not afterwards; so that these latter species are intermediate in their manner of moulting. there is also a great difference with many birds in the length of time during which the two annual plumages are retained; so that the one might come to be retained for the whole year, and the other completely lost. thus in the spring machetes pugnax retains his ruff for barely two months. in natal the male widow-bird (chera progne) acquires his fine plumage and long tail-feathers in december or january, and loses them in march; so that they are retained only for about three months. most species, which undergo a double moult, keep their ornamental feathers for about six months. the male, however, of the wild gallus bankiva retains his neck-hackles for nine or ten months; and when these are cast off, the underlying black feathers on the neck are fully exposed to view. but with the domesticated descendant of this species, the neck-hackles of the male are immediately replaced by new ones; so that we here see, as to part of the plumage, a double moult changed under domestication into a single moult. (82. for the foregoing statements in regard to partial moults, and on old males retaining their nuptial plumage, see jerdon, on bustards and plovers, in 'birds of india,' vol. iii. pp. 617, 637, 709, 711. also blyth in 'land and water,' 1867, p. 84. on the moulting of paradisea, see an interesting article by dr. w. marshall, 'archives neerlandaises,' tom. vi. 1871. on the vidua, 'ibis,' vol. iii. 1861, p. 133. on the drongo- shrikes, jerdon, ibid. vol. i. p. 435. on the vernal moult of the herodias bubulcus, mr. s.s. allen, in 'ibis,' 1863, p. 33. on gallus bankiva, blyth, in 'annals and mag. of natural history,' vol. i. 1848, p. 455; see, also, on this subject, my 'variation of animals under domestication,' vol. i. p. 236.) the common drake (anas boschas), after the breeding-season, is well known to lose his male plumage for a period of three months, during which time he assumes that of the female. the male pin-tail duck (anas acuta) loses his plumage for the shorter period of six weeks or two months; and montagu remarks that "this double moult within so short a time is a most extraordinary circumstance, that seems to bid defiance to all human reasoning." but the believer in the gradual modification of species will be far from feeling surprise at finding gradations of all kinds. if the male pin-tail were to acquire his new plumage within a still shorter period, the new male feathers would almost necessarily be mingled with the old, and both with some proper to the female; and this apparently is the case with the male of a not distantly-allied bird, namely the merganser serrator, for the males are said to "undergo a change of plumage, which assimilates them in some measure to the female." by a little further acceleration in the process, the double moult would be completely lost. (83. see macgillivray, 'hist. british birds' (vol. v. pp. 34, 70, and 223), on the moulting of the anatidae, with quotations from waterton and montagu. also yarrell, 'history of british birds,' vol. iii. p. 243.) some male birds, as before stated, become more brightly coloured in the spring, not by a vernal moult, but either by an actual change of colour in the feathers, or by their obscurely-coloured deciduary margins being shed. changes of colour thus caused may last for a longer or shorter time. in the pelecanus onocrotalus a beautiful rosy tint, with lemon-coloured marks on the breast, overspreads the whole plumage in the spring; but these tints, as mr. sclater states, "do not last long, disappearing generally in about six weeks or two months after they have been attained." certain finches shed the margins of their feathers in the spring, and then become brighter coloured, while other finches undergo no such change. thus the fringilla tristis of the united states (as well as many other american species) exhibits its bright colours only when the winter is past, whilst our goldfinch, which exactly represents this bird in habits, and our siskin, which represents it still more closely in structure, undergo no such annual change. but a difference of this kind in the plumage of allied species is not surprising, for with the common linnet, which belongs to the same family, the crimson forehead and breast are displayed only during the summer in england, whilst in madeira these colours are retained throughout the year. (84. on the pelican, see sclater, in 'proc. zool. soc.' 1868, p. 265. on the american finches, see audubon, 'ornithological biography,' vol. i. pp. 174, 221, and jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. ii. p. 383. on the fringilla cannabina of madeira, mr. e. vernon harcourt, 'ibis,' vol. v. 1863, p. 230.) display by male birds of their plumage. ornaments of all kinds, whether permanently or temporarily gained, are sedulously displayed by the males, and apparently serve to excite, attract, or fascinate the females. but the males will sometimes display their ornaments, when not in the presence of the females, as occasionally occurs with grouse at their balz-places, and as may be noticed with the peacock; this latter bird, however, evidently wishes for a spectator of some kind, and, as i have often seen, will shew off his finery before poultry, or even pigs. (85. see also 'ornamental poultry,' by rev. e.s. dixon, 1848, p. 8.) all naturalists who have closely attended to the habits of birds, whether in a state of nature or under confinement, are unanimously of opinion that the males take delight in displaying their beauty. audubon frequently speaks of the male as endeavouring in various ways to charm the female. mr. gould, after describing some peculiarities in a male humming- bird, says he has no doubt that it has the power of displaying them to the greatest advantage before the female. dr. jerdon (86. 'birds of india,' introduct., vol. i. p. xxiv.; on the peacock, vol. iii. p. 507. see gould's 'introduction to trochilidae,' 1861, pp. 15 and 111.) insists that the beautiful plumage of the male serves "to fascinate and attract the female." mr. bartlett, at the zoological gardens, expressed himself to me in the strongest terms to the same effect. [fig. 50. rupicola crocea, male (t.w. wood).] it must be a grand sight in the forests of india "to come suddenly on twenty or thirty pea-fowl, the males displaying their gorgeous trains, and strutting about in all the pomp of pride before the gratified females." the wild turkey-cock erects his glittering plumage, expands his finely- zoned tail and barred wing-feathers, and altogether, with his crimson and blue wattles, makes a superb, though, to our eyes, grotesque appearance. similar facts have already been given with respect to grouse of various kinds. turning to another order: the male rupicola crocea (fig. 50) is one of the most beautiful birds in the world, being of a splendid orange, with some of the feathers curiously truncated and plumose. the female is brownish-green, shaded with red, and has a much smaller crest. sir r. schomburgk has described their courtship; he found one of their meeting- places where ten males and two females were present. the space was from four to five feet in diameter, and appeared to have been cleared of every blade of grass and smoothed as if by human hands. a male "was capering, to the apparent delight of several others. now spreading its wings, throwing up its head, or opening its tail like a fan; now strutting about with a hopping gait until tired, when it gabbled some kind of note, and was relieved by another. thus three of them successively took the field, and then, with self-approbation, withdrew to rest." the indians, in order to obtain their skins, wait at one of the meeting-places till the birds are eagerly engaged in dancing, and then are able to kill with their poisoned arrows four or five males, one after the other. (87. 'journal of r. geograph. soc.' vol. x. 1840, p. 236.) with birds of paradise a dozen or more full-plumaged males congregate in a tree to hold a dancing-party, as it is called by the natives: and here they fly about, raise their wings, elevate their exquisite plumes, and make them vibrate, and the whole tree seems, as mr. wallace remarks, to be filled with waving plumes. when thus engaged, they become so absorbed that a skilful archer may shoot nearly the whole party. these birds, when kept in confinement in the malay archipelago, are said to take much care in keeping their feathers clean; often spreading them out, examining them, and removing every speck of dirt. one observer, who kept several pairs alive, did not doubt that the display of the male was intended to please the female. (88. 'annals and mag. of nat. hist.' vol. xiii. 1854, p. 157; also wallace, ibid. vol. xx. 1857, p. 412, and 'the malay archipelago,' vol. ii. 1869, p. 252. also dr. bennett, as quoted by brehm, 'thierleben,' b. iii. s. 326.) [fig. 51. polyplectron chinquis, male (t.w. wood).] the gold and amherst pheasants during their courtship not only expand and raise their splendid frills, but twist them, as i have myself seen, obliquely towards the female on whichever side she may be standing, obviously in order that a large surface may be displayed before her. (89. mr. t.w. wood has given ('the student,' april 1870, p. 115) a full account of this manner of display, by the gold pheasant and by the japanese pheasant, ph. versicolor; and he calls it the lateral or one-sided display.) they likewise turn their beautiful tails and tail-coverts a little towards the same side. mr. bartlett has observed a male polyplectron (fig. 51) in the act of courtship, and has shewn me a specimen stuffed in the attitude then assumed. the tail and wing-feathers of this bird are ornamented with beautiful ocelli, like those on the peacock's train. now when the peacock displays himself, he expands and erects his tail transversely to his body, for he stands in front of the female, and has to shew off, at the same time, his rich blue throat and breast. but the breast of the polyplectron is obscurely coloured, and the ocelli are not confined to the tail-feathers. consequently the polyplectron does not stand in front of the female; but he erects and expands his tail-feathers a little obliquely, lowering the expanded wing on the same side, and raising that on the opposite side. in this attitude the ocelli over the whole body are exposed at the same time before the eyes of the admiring female in one grand bespangled expanse. to whichever side she may turn, the expanded wings and the obliquely-held tail are turned towards her. the male tragopan pheasant acts in nearly the same manner, for he raises the feathers of the body, though not the wing itself, on the side which is opposite to the female, and which would otherwise be concealed, so that nearly all the beautifully spotted feathers are exhibited at the same time. [fig. 52. side view of male argus pheasant, whilst displaying before the female. observed and sketched from nature by t.w. wood.] the argus pheasant affords a much more remarkable case. the immensely developed secondary wing-feathers are confined to the male; and each is ornamented with a row of from twenty to twenty-three ocelli, above an inch in diameter. these feathers are also elegantly marked with oblique stripes and rows of spots of a dark colour, like those on the skin of a tiger and leopard combined. these beautiful ornaments are hidden until the male shows himself off before the female. he then erects his tail, and expands his wing-feathers into a great, almost upright, circular fan or shield, which is carried in front of the body. the neck and head are held on one side, so that they are concealed by the fan; but the bird in order to see the female, before whom he is displaying himself, sometimes pushes his head between two of the long wing-feathers (as mr. bartlett has seen), and then presents a grotesque appearance. this must be a frequent habit with the bird in a state of nature, for mr. bartlett and his son on examining some perfect skins sent from the east, found a place between two of the feathers which was much frayed, as if the head had here frequently been pushed through. mr. wood thinks that the male can also peep at the female on one side, beyond the margin of the fan. the ocelli on the wing-feathers are wonderful objects; for they are so shaded that, as the duke of argyll remarks (90. 'the reign of law,' 1867, p. 203.), they stand out like balls lying loosely within sockets. when i looked at the specimen in the british museum, which is mounted with the wings expanded and trailing downwards, i was however greatly disappointed, for the ocelli appeared flat, or even concave. but mr. gould soon made the case clear to me, for he held the feathers erect, in the position in which they would naturally be displayed, and now, from the light shining on them from above, each ocellus at once resembled the ornament called a ball and socket. these feathers have been shown to several artists, and all have expressed their admiration at the perfect shading. it may well be asked, could such artistically shaded ornaments have been formed by means of sexual selection? but it will be convenient to defer giving an answer to this question until we treat in the next chapter of the principle of gradation. the foregoing remarks relate to the secondary wing-feathers, but the primary wing-feathers, which in most gallinaceous birds are uniformly coloured, are in the argus pheasant equally wonderful. they are of a soft brown tint with numerous dark spots, each of which consists of two or three black dots with a surrounding dark zone. but the chief ornament is a space parallel to the dark-blue shaft, which in outline forms a perfect second feather lying within the true feather. this inner part is coloured of a lighter chestnut, and is thickly dotted with minute white points. i have shewn this feather to several persons, and many have admired it even more than the ball and socket feathers, and have declared that it was more like a work of art than of nature. now these feathers are quite hidden on all ordinary occasions, but are fully displayed, together with the long secondary feathers, when they are all expanded together so as to form the great fan or shield. the case of the male argus pheasant is eminently interesting, because it affords good evidence that the most refined beauty may serve as a sexual charm, and for no other purpose. we must conclude that this is the case, as the secondary and primary wing-feathers are not at all displayed, and the ball and socket ornaments are not exhibited in full perfection until the male assumes the attitude of courtship. the argus pheasant does not possess brilliant colours, so that his success in love appears to depend on the great size of his plumes, and on the elaboration of the most elegant patterns. many will declare that it is utterly incredible that a female bird should be able to appreciate fine shading and exquisite patterns. it is undoubtedly a marvellous fact that she should possess this almost human degree of taste. he who thinks that he can safely gauge the discrimination and taste of the lower animals may deny that the female argus pheasant can appreciate such refined beauty; but he will then be compelled to admit that the extraordinary attitudes assumed by the male during the act of courtship, by which the wonderful beauty of his plumage is fully displayed, are purposeless; and this is a conclusion which i for one will never admit. although so many pheasants and allied gallinaceous birds carefully display their plumage before the females, it is remarkable, as mr. bartlett informs me, that this is not the case with the dull-coloured eared and cheer pheasants (crossoptilon auritum and phasianus wallichii); so that these birds seem conscious that they have little beauty to display. mr. bartlett has never seen the males of either of these species fighting together, though he has not had such good opportunities for observing the cheer as the eared pheasant. mr. jenner weir, also, finds that all male birds with rich or strongly-characterised plumage are more quarrelsome than the dull- coloured species belonging to the same groups. the goldfinch, for instance, is far more pugnacious than the linnet, and the blackbird than the thrush. those birds which undergo a seasonal change of plumage likewise become much more pugnacious at the period when they are most gaily ornamented. no doubt the males of some obscurely-coloured birds fight desperately together, but it appears that when sexual selection has been highly influential, and has given bright colours to the males of any species, it has also very often given a strong tendency to pugnacity. we shall meet with nearly analogous cases when we treat of mammals. on the other hand, with birds the power of song and brilliant colours have rarely been both acquired by the males of the same species; but in this case the advantage gained would have been the same, namely success in charming the female. nevertheless it must be owned that the males of several brilliantly coloured birds have had their feathers specially modified for the sake of producing instrumental music, though the beauty of this cannot be compared, at least according to our taste, with that of the vocal music of many songsters. we will now turn to male birds which are not ornamented in any high degree, but which nevertheless display during their courtship whatever attractions they may possess. these cases are in some respects more curious than the foregoing, and have been but little noticed. i owe the following facts to mr. weir, who has long kept confined birds of many kinds, including all the british fringillidae and emberizidae. the facts have been selected from a large body of valuable notes kindly sent me by him. the bullfinch makes his advances in front of the female, and then puffs out his breast, so that many more of the crimson feathers are seen at once than otherwise would be the case. at the same time he twists and bows his black tail from side to side in a ludicrous manner. the male chaffinch also stands in front of the female, thus shewing his red breast and "blue bell," as the fanciers call his head; the wings at the same time being slightly expanded, with the pure white bands on the shoulders thus rendered conspicuous. the common linnet distends his rosy breast, slightly expands his brown wings and tail, so as to make the best of them by exhibiting their white edgings. we must, however, be cautious in concluding that the wings are spread out solely for display, as some birds do so whose wings are not beautiful. this is the case with the domestic cock, but it is always the wing on the side opposite to the female which is expanded, and at the same time scraped on the ground. the male goldfinch behaves differently from all other finches: his wings are beautiful, the shoulders being black, with the dark-tipped wing-feathers spotted with white and edged with golden yellow. when he courts the female, he sways his body from side to side, and quickly turns his slightly expanded wings first to one side, then to the other, with a golden flashing effect. mr. weir informs me that no other british finch turns thus from side to side during his courtship, not even the closely- allied male siskin, for he would not thus add to his beauty. most of the british buntings are plain coloured birds; but in the spring the feathers on the head of the male reed-bunting (emberiza schoeniculus) acquire a fine black colour by the abrasion of the dusky tips; and these are erected during the act of courtship. mr. weir has kept two species of amadina from australia: the a. castanotis is a very small and chastely coloured finch, with a dark tail, white rump, and jet-black upper tail- coverts, each of the latter being marked with three large conspicuous oval spots of white. (91. for the description of these birds, see gould's 'handbook to the birds of australia,' vol. i. 1865, p. 417.) this species, when courting the female, slightly spreads out and vibrates these parti- coloured tail-coverts in a very peculiar manner. the male amadina lathami behaves very differently, exhibiting before the female his brilliantly spotted breast, scarlet rump, and scarlet upper tail-coverts. i may here add from dr. jerdon that the indian bulbul (pycnonotus hoemorrhous) has its under tail-coverts of a crimson colour, and these, it might be thought, could never be well exhibited; but the bird "when excited often spreads them out laterally, so that they can be seen even from above." (92. 'birds of india,' vol. ii. p. 96.) the crimson under tail-coverts of some other birds, as with one of the woodpeckers, picus major, can be seen without any such display. the common pigeon has iridescent feathers on the breast, and every one must have seen how the male inflates his breast whilst courting the female, thus shewing them off to the best advantage. one of the beautiful bronze-winged pigeons of australia (ocyphaps lophotes) behaves, as described to me by mr. weir, very differently: the male, whilst standing before the female, lowers his head almost to the ground, spreads out and raises his tail, and half expands his wings. he then alternately and slowly raises and depresses his body, so that the iridescent metallic feathers are all seen at once, and glitter in the sun. sufficient facts have now been given to shew with what care male birds display their various charms, and this they do with the utmost skill. whilst preening their feathers, they have frequent opportunities for admiring themselves, and of studying how best to exhibit their beauty. but as all the males of the same species display themselves in exactly the same manner, it appears that actions, at first perhaps intentional, have become instinctive. if so, we ought not to accuse birds of conscious vanity; yet when we see a peacock strutting about, with expanded and quivering tail- feathers, he seems the very emblem of pride and vanity. the various ornaments possessed by the males are certainly of the highest importance to them, for in some cases they have been acquired at the expense of greatly impeded powers of flight or of running. the african night-jar (cosmetornis), which during the pairing-season has one of its primary wing-feathers developed into a streamer of very great length, is thereby much retarded in its flight, although at other times remarkable for its swiftness. the "unwieldy size" of the secondary wing-feathers of the male argus pheasant is said "almost entirely to deprive the bird of flight." the fine plumes of male birds of paradise trouble them during a high wind. the extremely long tail-feathers of the male widow-birds (vidua) of southern africa render "their flight heavy;" but as soon as these are cast off they fly as well as the females. as birds always breed when food is abundant, the males probably do not suffer much inconvenience in searching for food from their impeded powers of movement; but there can hardly be a doubt that they must be much more liable to be struck down by birds of prey. nor can we doubt that the long train of the peacock and the long tail and wing-feathers of the argus pheasant must render them an easier prey to any prowling tiger-cat than would otherwise be the case. even the bright colours of many male birds cannot fail to make them conspicuous to their enemies of all kinds. hence, as mr. gould has remarked, it probably is that such birds are generally of a shy disposition, as if conscious that their beauty was a source of danger, and are much more difficult to discover or approach, than the sombre coloured and comparatively tame females or than the young and as yet unadorned males. (93. on the cosmetornis, see livingstone's 'expedition to the zambesi,' 1865, p. 66. on the argus pheasant, jardine's 'nat. hist. lib.: birds,' vol. xiv. p. 167. on birds of paradise, lesson, quoted by brehm, 'thierleben,' b. iii. s. 325. on the widow-bird, barrow's 'travels in africa,' vol. i. p. 243, and 'ibis,' vol. iii. 1861 p. 133. mr. gould, on the shyness of male birds, 'handbook to birds of australia,' vol. i. 1865, pp. 210, 457.) it is a more curious fact that the males of some birds which are provided with special weapons for battle, and which in a state of nature are so pugnacious that they often kill each other, suffer from possessing certain ornaments. cock-fighters trim the hackles and cut off the combs and gills of their cocks; and the birds are then said to be dubbed. an undubbed bird, as mr. tegetmeier insists, "is at a fearful disadvantage; the comb and gills offer an easy hold to his adversary's beak, and as a cock always strikes where he holds, when once he has seized his foe, he has him entirely in his power. even supposing that the bird is not killed, the loss of blood suffered by an undubbed cock is much greater than that sustained by one that has been trimmed." (94. tegetmeier, 'the poultry book,' 1866, p. 139.) young turkey-cocks in fighting always seize hold of each other's wattles; and i presume that the old birds fight in the same manner. it may perhaps be objected that the comb and wattles are not ornamental, and cannot be of service to the birds in this way; but even to our eyes, the beauty of the glossy black spanish cock is much enhanced by his white face and crimson comb; and no one who has ever seen the splendid blue wattles of the male tragopan pheasant distended in courtship can for a moment doubt that beauty is the object gained. from the foregoing facts we clearly see that the plumes and other ornaments of the males must be of the highest importance to them; and we further see that beauty is even sometimes more important than success in battle. chapter xiv. birds--continued. choice exerted by the female--length of courtship--unpaired birds--mental qualities and taste for the beautiful--preference or antipathy shewn by the female for particular males--variability of birds--variations sometimes abrupt--laws of variation--formation of ocelli--gradations of character-- case of peacock, argus pheasant, and urosticte. when the sexes differ in beauty or in the power of singing, or in producing what i have called instrumental music, it is almost invariably the male who surpasses the female. these qualities, as we have just seen, are evidently of high importance to the male. when they are gained for only a part of the year it is always before the breeding-season. it is the male alone who elaborately displays his varied attractions, and often performs strange antics on the ground or in the air, in the presence of the female. each male drives away, or if he can, kills his rivals. hence we may conclude that it is the object of the male to induce the female to pair with him, and for this purpose he tries to excite or charm her in various ways; and this is the opinion of all those who have carefully studied the habits of living birds. but there remains a question which has an all important bearing on sexual selection, namely, does every male of the same species excite and attract the female equally? or does she exert a choice, and prefer certain males? this latter question can be answered in the affirmative by much direct and indirect evidence. it is far more difficult to decide what qualities determine the choice of the females; but here again we have some direct and indirect evidence that it is to a large extent the external attractions of the male; though no doubt his vigour, courage, and other mental qualities come into play. we will begin with the indirect evidence. length of courtship. the lengthened period during which both sexes of certain birds meet day after day at an appointed place probably depends partly on the courtship being a prolonged affair, and partly on reiteration in the act of pairing. thus in germany and scandinavia the balzen or leks of the black-cocks last from the middle of march, all through april into may. as many as forty or fifty, or even more birds congregate at the leks; and the same place is often frequented during successive years. the lek of the capercailzie lasts from the end of march to the middle or even end of may. in north america "the partridge dances" of the tetrao phasianellus "last for a month or more." other kinds of grouse, both in north america and eastern siberia (1. nordman describes ('bull. soc. imp. des nat. moscou,' 1861, tom. xxxiv. p. 264) the balzen of tetrao urogalloides in amur land. he estimated the number of birds assembled at above a hundred, not counting the females, which lie hid in the surrounding bushes. the noises uttered differ from those of t. urogallus.), follow nearly the same habits. the fowlers discover the hillocks where the ruffs congregate by the grass being trampled bare, and this shews that the same spot is long frequented. the indians of guiana are well acquainted with the cleared arenas, where they expect to find the beautiful cocks of the rock; and the natives of new guinea know the trees where from ten to twenty male birds of paradise in full plumage congregate. in this latter case it is not expressly stated that the females meet on the same trees, but the hunters, if not specially asked, would probably not mention their presence, as their skins are valueless. small parties of an african weaver (ploceus) congregate, during the breeding-season, and perform for hours their graceful evolutions. large numbers of the solitary snipe (scolopax major) assemble during dusk in a morass; and the same place is frequented for the same purpose during successive years; here they may be seen running about "like so many large rats," puffing out their feathers, flapping their wings, and uttering the strangest cries. (2. with respect to the assemblages of the above named grouse, see brehm, 'thierleben,' b. iv. s. 350; also l. lloyd, 'game birds of sweden,' 1867, pp. 19, 78. richardson, 'fauna bor. americana: birds,' p. 362. references in regard to the assemblages of other birds have already been given. on paradisea, see wallace, in 'annals and mag. of nat. hist.' vol. xx. 1857, p. 412. on the snipe, lloyd, ibid. p. 221.) some of the above birds,--the black-cock, capercailzie, pheasant-grouse, ruff, solitary snipe, and perhaps others,--are, as is believed, polygamists. with such birds it might have been thought that the stronger males would simply have driven away the weaker, and then at once have taken possession of as many females as possible; but if it be indispensable for the male to excite or please the female, we can understand the length of the courtship and the congregation of so many individuals of both sexes at the same spot. certain strictly monogamous species likewise hold nuptial assemblages; this seems to be the case in scandinavia with one of the ptarmigans, and their leks last from the middle of march to the middle of may. in australia the lyre-bird (menura superba) forms "small round hillocks," and the m. alberti scratches for itself shallow holes, or, as they are called by the natives, "corroborying places," where it is believed both sexes assemble. the meetings of the m. superba are sometimes very large; and an account has lately been published (3. quoted by mr. t.w. wood, in the 'student,' april 1870, p. 125.) by a traveller, who heard in a valley beneath him, thickly covered with scrub, "a din which completely astonished" him; on crawling onwards he beheld, to his amazement, about one hundred and fifty of the magnificent lyre-cocks, "ranged in order of battle, and fighting with indescribable fury." the bowers of the bower- birds are the resort of both sexes during the breeding-season; and "here the males meet and contend with each other for the favours of the female, and here the latter assemble and coquet with the males." with two of the genera, the same bower is resorted to during many years. (4. gould, 'handbook to the birds of australia,' vol. i. pp. 300, 308, 448, 451. on the ptarmigan, above alluded to, see lloyd, ibid. p. 129.) the common magpie (corvus pica, linn.), as i have been informed by the rev. w. darwin fox, used to assemble from all parts of delamere forest, in order to celebrate the "great magpie marriage." some years ago these birds abounded in extraordinary numbers, so that a gamekeeper killed in one morning nineteen males, and another killed by a single shot seven birds at roost together. they then had the habit of assembling very early in the spring at particular spots, where they could be seen in flocks, chattering, sometimes fighting, bustling and flying about the trees. the whole affair was evidently considered by the birds as one of the highest importance. shortly after the meeting they all separated, and were then observed by mr. fox and others to be paired for the season. in any district in which a species does not exist in large numbers, great assemblages cannot, of course, be held, and the same species may have different habits in different countries. for instance, i have heard of only one instance, from mr. wedderburn, of a regular assemblage of black game in scotland, yet these assemblages are so well known in germany and scandinavia that they have received special names. unpaired birds. from the facts now given, we may conclude that the courtship of birds belonging to widely different groups, is often a prolonged, delicate, and troublesome affair. there is even reason to suspect, improbable as this will at first appear, that some males and females of the same species, inhabiting the same district, do not always please each other, and consequently do not pair. many accounts have been published of either the male or female of a pair having been shot, and quickly replaced by another. this has been observed more frequently with the magpie than with any other bird, owing perhaps to its conspicuous appearance and nest. the illustrious jenner states that in wiltshire one of a pair was daily shot no less than seven times successively, "but all to no purpose, for the remaining magpie soon found another mate"; and the last pair reared their young. a new partner is generally found on the succeeding day; but mr. thompson gives the case of one being replaced on the evening of the same day. even after the eggs are hatched, if one of the old birds is destroyed a mate will often be found; this occurred after an interval of two days, in a case recently observed by one of sir j. lubbock's keepers. (5. on magpies, jenner, in 'philosophical transactions,' 1824, p. 21. macgillivray, 'hist. british birds,' vol. i. p. 570. thompson, in 'annals and magazine of natural history,' vol. viii. 1842, p. 494.) the first and most obvious conjecture is that male magpies must be much more numerous than females; and that in the above cases, as well as in many others which could be given, the males alone had been killed. this apparently holds good in some instances, for the gamekeepers in delamere forest assured mr. fox that the magpies and carrion-crows which they formerly killed in succession in large numbers near their nests, were all males; and they accounted for this fact by the males being easily killed whilst bringing food to the sitting females. macgillivray, however, gives, on the authority of an excellent observer, an instance of three magpies successively killed on the same nest, which were all females; and another case of six magpies successively killed whilst sitting on the same eggs, which renders it probable that most of them were females; though, as i hear from mr. fox, the male will sit on the eggs when the female is killed. sir j. lubbock's gamekeeper has repeatedly shot, but how often he could not say, one of a pair of jays (garrulus glandarius), and has never failed shortly afterwards to find the survivor re-matched. mr. fox, mr. f. bond, and others have shot one of a pair of carrion-crows (corvus corone), but the nest was soon again tenanted by a pair. these birds are rather common; but the peregrine-falcon (falco peregrinus) is rare, yet mr. thompson states that in ireland "if either an old male or female be killed in the breeding-season (not an uncommon circumstance), another mate is found within a very few days, so that the eyries, notwithstanding such casualties, are sure to turn out their complement of young." mr. jenner weir has known the same thing with the peregrine-falcons at beachy head. the same observer informs me that three kestrels (falco tinnunculus), all males, were killed one after the other whilst attending the same nest; two of these were in mature plumage, but the third was in the plumage of the previous year. even with the rare golden eagle (aquila chrysaetos), mr. birkbeck was assured by a trustworthy gamekeeper in scotland, that if one is killed, another is soon found. so with the white owl (strix flammea), "the survivor readily found a mate, and the mischief went on." white of selborne, who gives the case of the owl, adds that he knew a man, who from believing that partridges when paired were disturbed by the males fighting, used to shoot them; and though he had widowed the same female several times, she always soon found a fresh partner. this same naturalist ordered the sparrows, which deprived the house-martins of their nests, to be shot; but the one which was left, "be it cock or hen, presently procured a mate, and so for several times following." i could add analogous cases relating to the chaffinch, nightingale, and redstart. with respect to the latter bird (phoenicura ruticilla), a writer expresses much surprise how the sitting female could so soon have given effectual notice that she was a widow, for the species was not common in the neighbourhood. mr. jenner weir has mentioned to me a nearly similar case; at blackheath he never sees or hears the note of the wild bullfinch, yet when one of his caged males has died, a wild one in the course of a few days has generally come and perched near the widowed female, whose call-note is not loud. i will give only one other fact, on the authority of this same observer; one of a pair of starlings (sturnus vulgaris) was shot in the morning; by noon a new mate was found; this was again shot, but before night the pair was complete; so that the disconsolate widow or widower was thrice consoled during the same day. mr. engleheart also informs me that he used during several years to shoot one of a pair of starlings which built in a hole in a house at blackheath; but the loss was always immediately repaired. during one season he kept an account, and found that he had shot thirty-five birds from the same nest; these consisted of both males and females, but in what proportion he could not say: nevertheless, after all this destruction, a brood was reared. (6. on the peregrine falcon, see thompson, 'nat. hist. of ireland: birds,' vol. i. 1849, p. 39. on owls, sparrows, and partridges, see white, 'nat. hist. of selborne,' edit. of 1825, vol. i. p. 139. on the phoenicura, see loudon's 'mag. of nat. hist.' vol. vii. 1834, p. 245. brehm ('thierleben,' b. iv. s. 991) also alludes to cases of birds thrice mated during the same day.) these facts well deserve attention. how is it that there are birds enough ready to replace immediately a lost mate of either sex? magpies, jays, carrion-crows, partridges, and some other birds, are always seen during the spring in pairs, and never by themselves; and these offer at first sight the most perplexing cases. but birds of the same sex, although of course not truly paired, sometimes live in pairs or in small parties, as is known to be the case with pigeons and partridges. birds also sometimes live in triplets, as has been observed with starlings, carrion-crows, parrots, and partridges. with partridges two females have been known to live with one male, and two males with one female. in all such cases it is probable that the union would be easily broken; and one of the three would readily pair with a widow or widower. the males of certain birds may occasionally be heard pouring forth their love-song long after the proper time, shewing that they have either lost or never gained a mate. death from accident or disease of one of a pair would leave the other free and single; and there is reason to believe that female birds during the breeding-season are especially liable to premature death. again, birds which have had their nests destroyed, or barren pairs, or retarded individuals, would easily be induced to desert their mates, and would probably be glad to take what share they could of the pleasures and duties of rearing offspring although not their own. (7. see white ('nat. hist. of selborne,' 1825, vol. i. p. 140) on the existence, early in the season, of small coveys of male partridges, of which fact i have heard other instances. see jenner, on the retarded state of the generative organs in certain birds, in 'phil. transact.' 1824. in regard to birds living in triplets, i owe to mr. jenner weir the cases of the starlings and parrots, and to mr. fox, of partridges; on carrion-crows, see the 'field,' 1868, p. 415. on various male birds singing after the proper period, see rev. l. jenyns, 'observations in natural history,' 1846, p. 87.) such contingencies as these probably explain most of the foregoing cases. (8. the following case has been given ('the times,' aug. 6, 1868) by the rev. f.o. morris, on the authority of the hon. and rev. o.w. forester. "the gamekeeper here found a hawk's nest this year, with five young ones on it. he took four and killed them, but left one with its wings clipped as a decoy to destroy the old ones by. they were both shot next day, in the act of feeding the young one, and the keeper thought it was done with. the next day he came again and found two other charitable hawks, who had come with an adopted feeling to succour the orphan. these two he killed, and then left the nest. on returning afterwards he found two more charitable individuals on the same errand of mercy. one of these he killed; the other he also shot, but could not find. no more came on the like fruitless errand.") nevertheless, it is a strange fact that within the same district, during the height of the breeding-season, there should be so many males and females always ready to repair the loss of a mated bird. why do not such spare birds immediately pair together? have we not some reason to suspect, and the suspicion has occurred to mr. jenner weir, that as the courtship of birds appears to be in many cases prolonged and tedious, so it occasionally happens that certain males and females do not succeed, during the proper season, in exciting each other's love, and consequently do not pair? this suspicion will appear somewhat less improbable after we have seen what strong antipathies and preferences female birds occasionally evince towards particular males. mental qualities of birds, and their taste for the beautiful. before we further discuss the question whether the females select the more attractive males or accept the first whom they may encounter, it will be advisable briefly to consider the mental powers of birds. their reason is generally, and perhaps justly, ranked as low; yet some facts could be given leading to an opposite conclusion. (9. i am indebted to prof. newton for the following passage from mr. adam's 'travels of a naturalist,' 1870, p. 278. speaking of japanese nut-hatches in confinement, he says: "instead of the more yielding fruit of the yew, which is the usual food of the nut- hatch of japan, at one time i substituted hard hazel-nuts. as the bird was unable to crack them, he placed them one by one in his water-glass, evidently with the notion that they would in time become softer--an interesting proof of intelligence on the part of these birds.") low powers of reasoning, however, are compatible, as we see with mankind, with strong affections, acute perception, and a taste for the beautiful; and it is with these latter qualities that we are here concerned. it has often been said that parrots become so deeply attached to each other that when one dies the other pines for a long time; but mr. jenner weir thinks that with most birds the strength of their affection has been much exaggerated. nevertheless when one of a pair in a state of nature has been shot, the survivor has been heard for days afterwards uttering a plaintive call; and mr. st. john gives various facts proving the attachment of mated birds. (10. 'a tour in sutherlandshire,' vol. i. 1849, p. 185. dr. buller says ('birds of new zealand,' 1872, p. 56) that a male king lory was killed; and the female "fretted and moped, refused her food, and died of a broken heart.") mr. bennett relates (11. 'wanderings in new south wales,' vol. ii. 1834, p. 62.) that in china after a drake of the beautiful mandarin teal had been stolen, the duck remained disconsolate, though sedulously courted by another mandarin drake, who displayed before her all his charms. after an interval of three weeks the stolen drake was recovered, and instantly the pair recognised each other with extreme joy. on the other hand, starlings, as we have seen, may be consoled thrice in the same day for the loss of their mates. pigeons have such excellent local memories, that they have been known to return to their former homes after an interval of nine months, yet, as i hear from mr. harrison weir, if a pair which naturally would remain mated for life be separated for a few weeks during the winter, and afterwards matched with other birds, the two when brought together again, rarely, if ever, recognise each other. birds sometimes exhibit benevolent feelings; they will feed the deserted young ones even of distinct species, but this perhaps ought to be considered as a mistaken instinct. they will feed, as shewn in an earlier part of this work, adult birds of their own species which have become blind. mr. buxton gives a curious account of a parrot which took care of a frost-bitten and crippled bird of a distinct species, cleansed her feathers, and defended her from the attacks of the other parrots which roamed freely about his garden. it is a still more curious fact that these birds apparently evince some sympathy for the pleasures of their fellows. when a pair of cockatoos made a nest in an acacia tree, "it was ridiculous to see the extravagant interest taken in the matter by the others of the same species." these parrots, also, evinced unbounded curiosity, and clearly had "the idea of property and possession." (12. 'acclimatization of parrots,' by c. buxton, m.p., 'annals and mag. of nat. hist.' nov. 1868, p. 381.) they have good memories, for in the zoological gardens they have plainly recognised their former masters after an interval of some months. birds possess acute powers of observation. every mated bird, of course, recognises its fellow. audubon states that a certain number of mocking- thrushes (mimus polyglottus) remain all the year round in louisiana, whilst others migrate to the eastern states; these latter, on their return, are instantly recognised, and always attacked, by their southern brethren. birds under confinement distinguish different persons, as is proved by the strong and permanent antipathy or affection which they shew, without any apparent cause, towards certain individuals. i have heard of numerous instances with jays, partridges, canaries, and especially bullfinches. mr. hussey has described in how extraordinary a manner a tamed partridge recognised everybody: and its likes and dislikes were very strong. this bird seemed "fond of gay colours, and no new gown or cap could be put on without catching his attention." (13. the 'zoologist,' 1847-48, p. 1602.) mr. hewitt has described the habits of some ducks (recently descended from wild birds), which, at the approach of a strange dog or cat, would rush headlong into the water, and exhaust themselves in their attempts to escape; but they knew mr. hewitt's own dogs and cats so well that they would lie down and bask in the sun close to them. they always moved away from a strange man, and so they would from the lady who attended them if she made any great change in her dress. audubon relates that he reared and tamed a wild turkey which always ran away from any strange dog; this bird escaped into the woods, and some days afterwards audubon saw, as he thought, a wild turkey, and made his dog chase it; but, to his astonishment, the bird did not run away, and the dog, when he came up, did not attack the bird, for they mutually recognised each other as old friends. (14. hewitt on wild ducks, 'journal of horticulture,' jan. 13, 1863, p. 39. audubon on the wild turkey, 'ornithological biography,' vol. i. p. 14. on the mocking-thrush, ibid. vol. i. p. 110.) mr. jenner weir is convinced that birds pay particular attention to the colours of other birds, sometimes out of jealousy, and sometimes as a sign of kinship. thus he turned a reed-bunting (emberiza schoeniculus), which had acquired its black head-dress, into his aviary, and the new-comer was not noticed by any bird, except by a bullfinch, which is likewise black- headed. this bullfinch was a very quiet bird, and had never before quarrelled with any of its comrades, including another reed-bunting, which had not as yet become black-headed: but the reed-bunting with a black head was so unmercifully treated that it had to be removed. spiza cyanea, during the breeding-season, is of a bright blue colour; and though generally peaceable, it attacked s. ciris, which has only the head blue, and completely scalped the unfortunate bird. mr. weir was also obliged to turn out a robin, as it fiercely attacked all the birds in his aviary with any red in their plumage, but no other kinds; it actually killed a red- breasted crossbill, and nearly killed a goldfinch. on the other hand, he has observed that some birds, when first introduced, fly towards the species which resemble them most in colour, and settle by their sides. as male birds display their fine plumage and other ornaments with so much care before the females, it is obviously probable that these appreciate the beauty of their suitors. it is, however, difficult to obtain direct evidence of their capacity to appreciate beauty. when birds gaze at themselves in a looking-glass (of which many instances have been recorded) we cannot feel sure that it is not from jealousy of a supposed rival, though this is not the conclusion of some observers. in other cases it is difficult to distinguish between mere curiosity and admiration. it is perhaps the former feeling which, as stated by lord lilford (15. the 'ibis,' vol. ii. 1860, p. 344.), attracts the ruff towards any bright object, so that, in the ionian islands, "it will dart down to a bright- coloured handkerchief, regardless of repeated shots." the common lark is drawn down from the sky, and is caught in large numbers, by a small mirror made to move and glitter in the sun. is it admiration or curiosity which leads the magpie, raven, and some other birds to steal and secrete bright objects, such as silver articles or jewels? mr. gould states that certain humming-birds decorate the outsides of their nests "with the utmost taste; they instinctively fasten thereon beautiful pieces of flat lichen, the larger pieces in the middle, and the smaller on the part attached to the branch. now and then a pretty feather is intertwined or fastened to the outer sides, the stem being always so placed that the feather stands out beyond the surface." the best evidence, however, of a taste for the beautiful is afforded by the three genera of australian bower-birds already mentioned. their bowers (fig. 46), where the sexes congregate and play strange antics, are variously constructed, but what most concerns us is, that they are decorated by the several species in a different manner. the satin bower-bird collects gaily- coloured articles, such as the blue tail-feathers of parrakeets, bleached bones and shells, which it sticks between the twigs or arranges at the entrance. mr. gould found in one bower a neatly-worked stone tomahawk and a slip of blue cotton, evidently procured from a native encampment. these objects are continually re-arranged, and carried about by the birds whilst at play. the bower of the spotted bower-bird "is beautifully lined with tall grasses, so disposed that the heads nearly meet, and the decorations are very profuse." round stones are used to keep the grass-stems in their proper places, and to make divergent paths leading to the bower. the stones and shells are often brought from a great distance. the regent bird, as described by mr. ramsay, ornaments its short bower with bleached land-shells belonging to five or six species, and with "berries of various colours, blue, red, and black, which give it when fresh a very pretty appearance. besides these there were several newly-picked leaves and young shoots of a pinkish colour, the whole showing a decided taste for the beautiful." well may mr. gould say that "these highly decorated halls of assembly must be regarded as the most wonderful instances of bird- architecture yet discovered;" and the taste, as we see, of the several species certainly differs. (16. on the ornamented nests of humming-birds, gould, 'introduction to the trochilidae,' 1861, p. 19. on the bower-birds, gould, 'handbook to the birds of australia,' 1865, vol. i. pp. 444-461. ramsay, in the 'ibis,' 1867, p. 456.) preference for particular males by the females. having made these preliminary remarks on the discrimination and taste of birds, i will give all the facts known to me which bear on the preference shewn by the female for particular males. it is certain that distinct species of birds occasionally pair in a state of nature and produce hybrids. many instances could be given: thus macgillivray relates how a male blackbird and female thrush "fell in love with each other," and produced offspring. (17. 'history of brit. birds,' vol. ii. p. 92.) several years ago eighteen cases had been recorded of the occurrence in great britain of hybrids between the black grouse and pheasant (18. 'zoologist,' 1853-1854, p. 3946.); but most of these cases may perhaps be accounted for by solitary birds not finding one of their own species to pair with. with other birds, as mr. jenner weir has reason to believe, hybrids are sometimes the result of the casual intercourse of birds building in close proximity. but these remarks do not apply to the many recorded instances of tamed or domestic birds, belonging to distinct species, which have become absolutely fascinated with each other, although living with their own species. thus waterton (19. waterton, 'essays on nat. hist.' 2nd series, pp. 42 and 117. for the following statements see on the wigeon, 'loudon's mag. of nat. hist.' vol. ix. p. 616;

and they produced hybrid offspring. a male wigeon (mareca penelope), living with females of the same species, has been known to pair with a pintail duck, querquedula acuta. lloyd describes the remarkable attachment between a shield-drake (tadorna vulpanser) and a common duck. many additional instances could be given; and the rev. e.s. dixon remarks that "those who have kept many different species of geese together well know what unaccountable attachments they are frequently forming, and that they are quite as likely to pair and rear young with individuals of a race (species) apparently the most alien to themselves as with their own stock." the rev. w.d. fox informs me that he possessed at the same time a pair of chinese geese (anser cygnoides), and a common gander with three geese. the two lots kept quite separate, until the chinese gander seduced one of the common geese to live with him. moreover, of the young birds hatched from the eggs of the common geese, only four were pure, the other eighteen proving hybrids; so that the chinese gander seems to have had prepotent charms over the common gander. i will give only one other case; mr. hewitt states that a wild duck, reared in captivity, "after breeding a couple of seasons with her own mallard, at once shook him off on my placing a male pintail on the water. it was evidently a case of love at first sight, for she swam about the new-comer caressingly, though he appeared evidently alarmed and averse to her overtures of affection. from that hour she forgot her old partner. winter passed by, and the next spring the pintail seemed to have become a convert to her blandishments, for they nested and produced seven or eight young ones." what the charm may have been in these several cases, beyond mere novelty, we cannot even conjecture. colour, however, sometimes comes into play; for in order to raise hybrids from the siskin (fringilla spinus) and the canary, it is much the best plan, according to bechstein, to place birds of the same tint together. mr. jenner weir turned a female canary into his aviary, where there were male linnets, goldfinches, siskins, greenfinches, chaffinches, and other birds, in order to see which she would choose; but there never was any doubt, and the greenfinch carried the day. they paired and produced hybrid offspring. the fact of the female preferring to pair with one male rather than with another of the same species is not so likely to excite attention, as when this occurs, as we have just seen, between distinct species. the former cases can best be observed with domesticated or confined birds; but these are often pampered by high feeding, and sometimes have their instincts vitiated to an extreme degree. of this latter fact i could give sufficient proofs with pigeons, and especially with fowls, but they cannot be here related. vitiated instincts may also account for some of the hybrid unions above mentioned; but in many of these cases the birds were allowed to range freely over large ponds, and there is no reason to suppose that they were unnaturally stimulated by high feeding. with respect to birds in a state of nature, the first and most obvious supposition which will occur to every one is that the female at the proper season accepts the first male whom she may encounter; but she has at least the opportunity for exerting a choice, as she is almost invariably pursued by many males. audubon--and we must remember that he spent a long life in prowling about the forests of the united states and observing the birds-- does not doubt that the female deliberately chooses her mate; thus, speaking of a woodpecker, he says the hen is followed by half-a-dozen gay suitors, who continue performing strange antics, "until a marked preference is shewn for one." the female of the red-winged starling (agelaeus phoeniceus) is likewise pursued by several males, "until, becoming fatigued, she alights, receives their addresses, and soon makes a choice." he describes also how several male night-jars repeatedly plunge through the air with astonishing rapidity, suddenly turning, and thus making a singular noise; "but no sooner has the female made her choice than the other males are driven away." with one of the vultures (cathartes aura) of the united states, parties of eight, ten, or more males and females assemble on fallen logs, "exhibiting the strongest desire to please mutually," and after many caresses, each male leads off his partner on the wing. audubon likewise carefully observed the wild flocks of canada geese (anser canadensis), and gives a graphic description of their love-antics; he says that the birds which had been previously mated "renewed their courtship as early as the month of january, while the others would be contending or coquetting for hours every day, until all seemed satisfied with the choice they had made, after which, although they remained together, any person could easily perceive that they were careful to keep in pairs. i have observed also that the older the birds the shorter were the preliminaries of their courtship. the bachelors and old maids whether in regret, or not caring to be disturbed by the bustle, quietly moved aside and lay down at some distance from the rest." (20. audubon, 'ornithological biography,' vol. i. pp. 191, 349; vol. ii. pp. 42, 275; vol. iii. p. 2.) many similar statements with respect to other birds could be cited from this same observer. turning now to domesticated and confined birds, i will commence by giving what little i have learnt respecting the courtship of fowls. i have received long letters on this subject from messrs. hewitt and tegetmeier, and almost an essay from the late mr. brent. it will be admitted by every one that these gentlemen, so well known from their published works, are careful and experienced observers. they do not believe that the females prefer certain males on account of the beauty of their plumage; but some allowance must be made for the artificial state under which these birds have long been kept. mr. tegetmeier is convinced that a gamecock, though disfigured by being dubbed and with his hackles trimmed, would be accepted as readily as a male retaining all his natural ornaments. mr. brent, however, admits that the beauty of the male probably aids in exciting the female; and her acquiescence is necessary. mr. hewitt is convinced that the union is by no means left to mere chance, for the female almost invariably prefers the most vigorous, defiant, and mettlesome male; hence it is almost useless, as he remarks, "to attempt true breeding if a game- cock in good health and condition runs the locality, for almost every hen on leaving the roosting-place will resort to the game-cock, even though that bird may not actually drive away the male of her own variety." under ordinary circumstances the males and females of the fowl seem to come to a mutual understanding by means of certain gestures, described to me by mr. brent. but hens will often avoid the officious attentions of young males. old hens, and hens of a pugnacious disposition, as the same writer informs me, dislike strange males, and will not yield until well beaten into compliance. ferguson, however, describes how a quarrelsome hen was subdued by the gentle courtship of a shanghai cock. (21. 'rare and prize poultry,' 1854, p. 27.) there is reason to believe that pigeons of both sexes prefer pairing with birds of the same breed; and dovecot-pigeons dislike all the highly improved breeds. (22. 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. p. 103.) mr. harrison weir has lately heard from a trustworthy observer, who keeps blue pigeons, that these drive away all other coloured varieties, such as white, red, and yellow; and from another observer, that a female dun carrier could not, after repeated trials, be matched with a black male, but immediately paired with a dun. again, mr. tegetmeier had a female blue turbit that obstinately refused to pair with two males of the same breed, which were successively shut up with her for weeks; but on being let out she would have immediately accepted the first blue dragon that offered. as she was a valuable bird, she was then shut up for many weeks with a silver (i.e., very pale blue) male, and at last mated with him. nevertheless, as a general rule, colour appears to have little influence on the pairing of pigeons. mr. tegetmeier, at my request, stained some of his birds with magenta, but they were not much noticed by the others. female pigeons occasionally feel a strong antipathy towards certain males, without any assignable cause. thus mm. boitard and corbie, whose experience extended over forty-five years, state: "quand une femelle éprouve de l'antipathie pour un mâle avec lequel on veut l'accoupler, malgré tous les feux de l'amour, malgré l'alpiste et le chenevis dont on la nourrit pour augmenter son ardeur, malgré un emprisonnement de six mois et même d'un an, elle refuse constamment ses caresses; les avances empressées, les agaceries, les tournoiemens, les tendres roucoulemens, rien ne peut lui plaire ni l'émouvoir; gonflée, boudeuse, blottie dans un coin de sa prison, elle n'en sort que pour boire et manger, ou pour repousser avec une espèce de rage des caresses devenues trop pressantes." (23. boitard and corbie, 'les pigeons,' etc., 1824, p. 12. prosper lucas ('traité de l'héréd. nat.' tom. ii. 1850, p. 296) has himself observed nearly similar facts with pigeons.) on the other hand, mr. harrison weir has himself observed, and has heard from several breeders, that a female pigeon will occasionally take a strong fancy for a particular male, and will desert her own mate for him. some females, according to another experienced observer, riedel (24. die taubenzucht, 1824, s. 86.), are of a profligate disposition, and prefer almost any stranger to their own mate. some amorous males, called by our english fanciers "gay birds," are so successful in their gallantries, that, as mr. h. weir informs me, they must be shut up on account of the mischief which they cause. wild turkeys in the united states, according to audubon, "sometimes pay their addresses to the domesticated females, and are generally received by them with great pleasure." so that these females apparently prefer the wild to their own males. (25. 'ornithological biography,' vol. i. p. 13. see to the same effect, dr. bryant, in allen's 'mammals and birds of florida,' p. 344.) here is a more curious case. sir r. heron during many years kept an account of the habits of the peafowl, which he bred in large numbers. he states that "the hens have frequently great preference to a particular peafowl. they were all so fond of an old pied cock, that one year, when he was confined, though still in view, they were constantly assembled close to the trellice-walls of his prison, and would not suffer a japanned peacock to touch them. on his being let out in the autumn, the oldest of the hens instantly courted him and was successful in her courtship. the next year he was shut up in a stable, and then the hens all courted his rival." (26. 'proceedings, zoological society,' 1835, p. 54. the japanned peacock is considered by mr. sclater as a distinct species, and has been named pavo nigripennis; but the evidence seems to me to show that it is only a variety.) this rival was a japanned or black-winged peacock, to our eyes a more beautiful bird than the common kind. lichtenstein, who was a good observer and had excellent opportunities of observation at the cape of good hope, assured rudolphi that the female widow-bird (chera progne) disowns the male when robbed of the long tail- feathers with which he is ornamented during the breeding-season. i presume that this observation must have been made on birds under confinement. (27. rudolphi, 'beiträge zur anthropologie,' 1812, s. 184.) here is an analogous case; dr. jaeger (28. 'die darwin'sche theorie, und ihre stellung zu moral und religion,' 1869, s. 59.), director of the zoological gardens of vienna, states that a male silver-pheasant, who had been triumphant over all other males and was the accepted lover of the females, had his ornamental plumage spoiled. he was then immediately superseded by a rival, who got the upper hand and afterwards led the flock. it is a remarkable fact, as shewing how important colour is in the courtship of birds, that mr. boardman, a well-known collector and observer of birds for many years in the northern united states, has never in his large experience seen an albino paired with another bird; yet he has had opportunities of observing many albinos belonging to several species. (29. this statement is given by mr. a. leith adams, in his 'field and forest rambles,' 1873, p. 76, and accords with his own experience.) it can hardly be maintained that albinos in a state of nature are incapable of breeding, as they can be raised with the greatest facility under confinement. it appears, therefore, that we must attribute the fact that they do not pair to their rejection by their normally coloured comrades. female birds not only exert a choice, but in some few cases they court the male, or even fight together for his possession. sir r. heron states that with peafowl, the first advances are always made by the female; something of the same kind takes place, according to audubon, with the older females of the wild turkey. with the capercailzie, the females flit round the male whilst he is parading at one of the places of assemblage, and solicit his attention. (30. in regard to peafowl, see sir r. heron, 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1835, p. 54, and the rev. e.s. dixon, 'ornamental poultry,' 1848, p. 8. for the turkey, audubon, ibid. p. 4. for the capercailzie, lloyd, 'game birds of sweden,' 1867, p. 23.) we have seen that a tame wild-duck seduced an unwilling pintail drake after a long courtship. mr. bartlett believes that the lophophorus, like many other gallinaceous birds, is naturally polygamous, but two females cannot be placed in the same cage with a male, as they fight so much together. the following instance of rivalry is more surprising as it relates to bullfinches, which usually pair for life. mr. jenner weir introduced a dull-coloured and ugly female into his aviary, and she immediately attacked another mated female so unmercifully that the latter had to be separated. the new female did all the courtship, and was at last successful, for she paired with the male; but after a time she met with a just retribution, for, ceasing to be pugnacious, she was replaced by the old female, and the male then deserted his new and returned to his old love. in all ordinary cases the male is so eager that he will accept any female, and does not, as far as we can judge, prefer one to the other; but, as we shall hereafter see, exceptions to this rule apparently occur in some few groups. with domesticated birds, i have heard of only one case of males shewing any preference for certain females, namely, that of the domestic cock, who, according to the high authority of mr. hewitt, prefers the younger to the older hens. on the other hand, in effecting hybrid unions between the male pheasant and common hens, mr. hewitt is convinced that the pheasant invariably prefers the older birds. he does not appear to be in the least influenced by their colour; but "is most capricious in his attachments" (31. mr. hewitt, quoted in tegetmeier's 'poultry book,' 1866, p. 165.): from some inexplicable cause he shews the most determined aversion to certain hens, which no care on the part of the breeder can overcome. mr. hewitt informs me that some hens are quite unattractive even to the males of their own species, so that they may be kept with several cocks during a whole season, and not one egg out of forty or fifty will prove fertile. on the other hand, with the long-tailed duck (harelda glacialis), "it has been remarked," says m. ekstrom, "that certain females are much more courted than the rest. frequently, indeed, one sees an individual surrounded by six or eight amorous males." whether this statement is credible, i know not; but the native sportsmen shoot these females in order to stuff them as decoys. (32. quoted in lloyd's 'game birds of sweden,' p. 345.) with respect to female birds feeling a preference for particular males, we must bear in mind that we can judge of choice being exerted only by analogy. if an inhabitant of another planet were to behold a number of young rustics at a fair courting a pretty girl, and quarrelling about her like birds at one of their places of assemblage, he would, by the eagerness of the wooers to please her and to display their finery, infer that she had the power of choice. now with birds the evidence stands thus: they have acute powers of observation, and they seem to have some taste for the beautiful both in colour and sound. it is certain that the females occasionally exhibit, from unknown causes, the strongest antipathies and preferences for particular males. when the sexes differ in colour or in other ornaments the males with rare exceptions are the more decorated, either permanently or temporarily during the breeding-season. they sedulously display their various ornaments, exert their voices, and perform strange antics in the presence of the females. even well-armed males, who, it might be thought, would altogether depend for success on the law of battle, are in most cases highly ornamented; and their ornaments have been acquired at the expense of some loss of power. in other cases ornaments have been acquired, at the cost of increased risk from birds and beasts of prey. with various species many individuals of both sexes congregate at the same spot, and their courtship is a prolonged affair. there is even reason to suspect that the males and females within the same district do not always succeed in pleasing each other and pairing. what then are we to conclude from these facts and considerations? does the male parade his charms with so much pomp and rivalry for no purpose? are we not justified in believing that the female exerts a choice, and that she receives the addresses of the male who pleases her most? it is not probable that she consciously deliberates; but she is most excited or attracted by the most beautiful, or melodious, or gallant males. nor need it be supposed that the female studies each stripe or spot of colour; that the peahen, for instance, admires each detail in the gorgeous train of the peacock--she is probably struck only by the general effect. nevertheless, after hearing how carefully the male argus pheasant displays his elegant primary wing-feathers, and erects his ocellated plumes in the right position for their full effect; or again, how the male goldfinch alternately displays his gold-bespangled wings, we ought not to feel too sure that the female does not attend to each detail of beauty. we can judge, as already remarked, of choice being exerted, only from analogy; and the mental powers of birds do not differ fundamentally from ours. from these various considerations we may conclude that the pairing of birds is not left to chance; but that those males, which are best able by their various charms to please or excite the female, are under ordinary circumstances accepted. if this be admitted, there is not much difficulty in understanding how male birds have gradually acquired their ornamental characters. all animals present individual differences, and as man can modify his domesticated birds by selecting the individuals which appear to him the most beautiful, so the habitual or even occasional preference by the female of the more attractive males would almost certainly lead to their modification; and such modifications might in the course of time be augmented to almost any extent, compatible with the existence of the species. variability of birds, and especially of their secondary sexual characters. variability and inheritance are the foundations for the work of selection. that domesticated birds have varied greatly, their variations being inherited, is certain. that birds in a state of nature have been modified into distinct races is now universally admitted. (33. according to dr. blasius ('ibis,' vol. ii. 1860, p. 297), there are 425 indubitable species of birds which breed in europe, besides sixty forms, which are frequently regarded as distinct species. of the latter, blasius thinks that only ten are really doubtful, and that the other fifty ought to be united with their nearest allies; but this shews that there must be a considerable amount of variation with some of our european birds. it is also an unsettled point with naturalists, whether several north american birds ought to be ranked as specifically distinct from the corresponding european species. so again many north american forms which until lately were named as distinct species, are now considered to be local races.) variations may be divided into two classes; those which appear to our ignorance to arise spontaneously, and those which are directly related to the surrounding conditions, so that all or nearly all the individuals of the same species are similarly modified. cases of the latter kind have recently been observed with care by mr. j.a. allen (34. 'mammals and birds of east florida,' also an 'ornithological reconnaissance of kansas,' etc. notwithstanding the influence of climate on the colours of birds, it is difficult to account for the dull or dark tints of almost all the species inhabiting certain countries, for instance, the galapagos islands under the equator, the wide temperate plains of patagonia, and, as it appears, egypt (see mr. hartshorne in the 'american naturalist,' 1873, p. 747). these countries are open, and afford little shelter to birds; but it seems doubtful whether the absence of brightly coloured species can be explained on the principle of protection, for on the pampas, which are equally open, though covered by green grass, and where the birds would be equally exposed to danger, many brilliant and conspicuously coloured species are common. i have sometimes speculated whether the prevailing dull tints of the scenery in the above named countries may not have affected the appreciation of bright colours by the birds inhabiting them.), who shews that in the united states many species of birds gradually become more strongly coloured in proceeding southward, and more lightly coloured in proceeding westward to the arid plains of the interior. both sexes seem generally to be affected in a like manner, but sometimes one sex more than the other. this result is not incompatible with the belief that the colours of birds are mainly due to the accumulation of successive variations through sexual selection; for even after the sexes have been greatly differentiated, climate might produce an equal effect on both sexes, or a greater effect on one sex than on the other, owing to some constitutional difference. individual differences between the members of the same species are admitted by every one to occur under a state of nature. sudden and strongly marked variations are rare; it is also doubtful whether if beneficial they would often be preserved through selection and transmitted to succeeding generations. (35. 'origin of species' fifth edit. 1869, p.104. i had always perceived, that rare and strongly-marked deviations of structure, deserving to be called monstrosities, could seldom be preserved through natural selection, and that the preservation of even highly-beneficial variations would depend to a certain extent on chance. i had also fully appreciated the importance of mere individual differences, and this led me to insist so strongly on the importance of that unconscious form of selection by man, which follows from the preservation of the most valued individuals of each breed, without any intention on his part to modify the characters of the breed. but until i read an able article in the 'north british review' (march 1867, p. 289, et seq.), which has been of more use to me than any other review, i did not see how great the chances were against the preservation of variations, whether slight or strongly pronounced, occurring only in single individuals.) nevertheless, it may be worth while to give the few cases which i have been able to collect, relating chiefly to colour,--simple albinism and melanism being excluded. mr. gould is well known to admit the existence of few varieties, for he esteems very slight differences as specific; yet he states (36. 'introduction to the trochlidae,' p. 102.) that near bogota certain humming-birds belonging to the genus cynanthus are divided into two or three races or varieties, which differ from each other in the colouring of the tail--"some having the whole of the feathers blue, while others have the eight central ones tipped with beautiful green." it does not appear that intermediate gradations have been observed in this or the following cases. in the males alone of one of the australian parrakeets "the thighs in some are scarlet, in others grass-green." in another parrakeet of the same country "some individuals have the band across the wing-coverts bright-yellow, while in others the same part is tinged with red." (37. gould, 'handbook to birds of australia,' vol. ii. pp. 32 and 68.) in the united states some few of the males of the scarlet tanager (tanagra rubra) have "a beautiful transverse band of glowing red on the smaller wing- coverts" (38. audubon, 'ornithological biography,' 1838, vol. iv. p. 389.); but this variation seems to be somewhat rare, so that its preservation through sexual selection would follow only under usually favourable circumstances. in bengal the honey buzzard (pernis cristata) has either a small rudimental crest on its head, or none at all: so slight a difference, however, would not have been worth notice, had not this same species possessed in southern india a well-marked occipital crest formed of several graduated feathers." (39. jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. i. p. 108; and mr. blyth, in 'land and water,' 1868, p. 381.) the following case is in some respects more interesting. a pied variety of the raven, with the head, breast, abdomen, and parts of the wings and tail- feathers white, is confined to the feroe islands. it is not very rare there, for graba saw during his visit from eight to ten living specimens. although the characters of this variety are not quite constant, yet it has been named by several distinguished ornithologists as a distinct species. the fact of the pied birds being pursued and persecuted with much clamour by the other ravens of the island was the chief cause which led brunnich to conclude that they were specifically distinct; but this is now known to be an error. (40. graba, 'tagebuch reise nach faro,' 1830, ss. 51-54. macgillivray, 'history of british birds,' vol. iii. p. 745, 'ibis,' vol. v. 1863, p. 469.) this case seems analogous to that lately given of albino birds not pairing from being rejected by their comrades. in various parts of the northern seas a remarkable variety of the common guillemot (uria troile) is found; and in feroe, one out of every five birds, according to graba's estimation, presents this variation. it is characterised (41. graba, ibid. s. 54. macgillivray, ibid. vol. v. p. 327.) by a pure white ring round the eye, with a curved narrow white line, an inch and a half in length, extending back from the ring. this conspicuous character has caused the bird to be ranked by several ornithologists as a distinct species under the name of u. lacrymans, but it is now known to be merely a variety. it often pairs with the common kind, yet intermediate gradations have never been seen; nor is this surprising, for variations which appear suddenly, are often, as i have elsewhere shewn (42. 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. p. 92.), transmitted either unaltered or not at all. we thus see that two distinct forms of the same species may co-exist in the same district, and we cannot doubt that if the one had possessed any advantage over the other, it would soon have been multiplied to the exclusion of the latter. if, for instance, the male pied ravens, instead of being persecuted by their comrades, had been highly attractive (like the above pied peacock) to the black female ravens their numbers would have rapidly increased. and this would have been a case of sexual selection. with respect to the slight individual differences which are common, in a greater or less degree, to all the members of the same species, we have every reason to believe that they are by far the most important for the work of selection. secondary sexual characters are eminently liable to vary, both with animals in a state of nature and under domestication. (43. on these points see also 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. i. p. 253; vol ii. pp. 73, 75.) there is also reason to believe, as we have seen in our eighth chapter, that variations are more apt to occur in the male than in the female sex. all these contingencies are highly favourable for sexual selection. whether characters thus acquired are transmitted to one sex or to both sexes, depends, as we shall see in the following chapter, on the form of inheritance which prevails. it is sometimes difficult to form an opinion whether certain slight differences between the sexes of birds are simply the result of variability with sexually-limited inheritance, without the aid of sexual selection, or whether they have been augmented through this latter process. i do not here refer to the many instances where the male displays splendid colours or other ornaments, of which the female partakes to a slight degree; for these are almost certainly due to characters primarily acquired by the male having been more or less transferred to the female. but what are we to conclude with respect to certain birds in which, for instance, the eyes differ slightly in colour in the two sexes? (44. see, for instance, on the irides of a podica and gallicrex in 'ibis,' vol. ii. 1860, p. 206; and vol. v. 1863, p. 426.) in some cases the eyes differ conspicuously; thus with the storks of the genus xenorhynchus, those of the male are blackish- hazel, whilst those of the females are gamboge-yellow; with many hornbills (buceros), as i hear from mr. blyth (45. see also jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. i. pp. 243-245.), the males have intense crimson eyes, and those of the females are white. in the buceros bicornis, the hind margin of the casque and a stripe on the crest of the beak are black in the male, but not so in the female. are we to suppose that these black marks and the crimson colour of the eyes have been preserved or augmented through sexual selection in the males? this is very doubtful; for mr. bartlett shewed me in the zoological gardens that the inside of the mouth of this buceros is black in the male and flesh-coloured in the female; and their external appearance or beauty would not be thus affected. i observed in chile (46. 'zoology of the voyage of h.m.s. "beagle,"' 1841, p. 6.) that the iris in the condor, when about a year old, is dark-brown, but changes at maturity into yellowish-brown in the male, and into bright red in the female. the male has also a small, longitudinal, leaden-coloured, fleshy crest or comb. the comb of many gallinaceous birds is highly ornamental, and assumes vivid colours during the act of courtship; but what are we to think of the dull- coloured comb of the condor, which does not appear to us in the least ornamental? the same question may be asked in regard to various other characters, such as the knob on the base of the beak of the chinese goose (anser cygnoides), which is much larger in the male than in the female. no certain answer can be given to these questions; but we ought to be cautious in assuming that knobs and various fleshy appendages cannot be attractive to the female, when we remember that with savage races of man various hideous deformities--deep scars on the face with the flesh raised into protuberances, the septum of the nose pierced by sticks or bones, holes in the ears and lips stretched widely open--are all admired as ornamental. whether or not unimportant differences between the sexes, such as those just specified, have been preserved through sexual selection, these differences, as well as all others, must primarily depend on the laws of variation. on the principle of correlated development, the plumage often varies on different parts of the body, or over the whole body, in the same manner. we see this well illustrated in certain breeds of the fowl. in all the breeds the feathers on the neck and loins of the males are elongated, and are called hackles; now when both sexes acquire a top-knot, which is a new character in the genus, the feathers on the head of the male become hackle-shaped, evidently on the principle of correlation; whilst those on the head of the female are of the ordinary shape. the colour also of the hackles forming the top-knot of the male, is often correlated with that of the hackles on the neck and loins, as may be seen by comparing these feathers in the golden and silver-spangled polish, the houdans, and creve-coeur breeds. in some natural species we may observe exactly the same correlation in the colours of these same feathers, as in the males of the splendid gold and amherst pheasants. the structure of each individual feather generally causes any change in its colouring to be symmetrical; we see this in the various laced, spangled, and pencilled breeds of the fowl; and on the principle of correlation the feathers over the whole body are often coloured in the same manner. we are thus enabled without much trouble to rear breeds with their plumage marked almost as symmetrically as in natural species. in laced and spangled fowls the coloured margins of the feathers are abruptly defined; but in a mongrel raised by me from a black spanish cock glossed with green, and a white game-hen, all the feathers were greenish-black, excepting towards their extremities, which were yellowish-white; but between the white extremities and the black bases, there was on each feather a symmetrical, curved zone of dark-brown. in some instances the shaft of the feather determines the distribution of the tints; thus with the body-feathers of a mongrel from the same black spanish cock and a silver-spangled polish hen, the shaft, together with a narrow space on each side, was greenish-black, and this was surrounded by a regular zone of dark-brown, edged with brownish-white. in these cases we have feathers symmetrically shaded, like those which give so much elegance to the plumage of many natural species. i have also noticed a variety of the common pigeon with the wing-bars symmetrically zoned with three bright shades, instead of being simply black on a slaty-blue ground, as in the parent-species. in many groups of birds the plumage is differently coloured in the several species, yet certain spots, marks, or stripes are retained by all. analogous cases occur with the breeds of the pigeon, which usually retain the two wing-bars, though they may be coloured red, yellow, white, black, or blue, the rest of the plumage being of some wholly different tint. here is a more curious case, in which certain marks are retained, though coloured in a manner almost exactly the opposite of what is natural; the aboriginal pigeon has a blue tail, with the terminal halves of the outer webs of the two outer tail feathers white; now there is a sub-variety having a white instead of a blue tail, with precisely that part black which is white in the parent-species. (47. bechstein, 'naturgeschichte deutschlands,' b. iv. 1795, s. 31, on a sub-variety of the monck pigeon.) formation and variability of the ocelli or eye-like spots on the plumage of birds. [fig. 53. cyllo leda, linn., from a drawing by mr. trimen, shewing the extreme range of variation in the ocelli. a. specimen, from mauritius, upper surface of fore-wing. a1. specimen, from natal, ditto. b. specimen, from java, upper surface of hind-wing. b1. specimen, from mauritius, ditto.] as no ornaments are more beautiful than the ocelli on the feathers of various birds, on the hairy coats of some mammals, on the scales of reptiles and fishes, on the skin of amphibians, on the wings of many lepidoptera and other insects, they deserve to be especially noticed. an ocellus consists of a spot within a ring of another colour, like the pupil within the iris, but the central spot is often surrounded by additional concentric zones. the ocelli on the tail-coverts of the peacock offer a familiar example, as well as those on the wings of the peacock-butterfly (vanessa). mr. trimen has given me a description of a s. african moth (gynanisa isis), allied to our emperor moth, in which a magnificent ocellus occupies nearly the whole surface of each hinder wing; it consists of a black centre, including a semi-transparent crescent-shaped mark, surrounded by successive, ochre-yellow, black, ochre-yellow, pink, white, pink, brown, and whitish zones. although we do not know the steps by which these wonderfully beautiful and complex ornaments have been developed, the process has probably been a simple one, at least with insects; for, as mr. trimen writes to me, "no characters of mere marking or coloration are so unstable in the lepidoptera as the ocelli, both in number and size." mr. wallace, who first called my attention to this subject, shewed me a series of specimens of our common meadow-brown butterfly (hipparchia janira) exhibiting numerous gradations from a simple minute black spot to an elegantly-shaded ocellus. in a s. african butterfly (cyllo leda, linn.), belonging to the same family, the ocelli are even still more variable. in some specimens (a, fig. 53) large spaces on the upper surface of the wings are coloured black, and include irregular white marks; and from this state a complete gradation can be traced into a tolerably perfect ocellus (a1), and this results from the contraction of the irregular blotches of colour. in another series of specimens a gradation can be followed from excessively minute white dots, surrounded by a scarcely visible black line (b), into perfectly symmetrical and large ocelli (b1). (48. this woodcut has been engraved from a beautiful drawing, most kindly made for me by mr. trimen; see also his description of the wonderful amount of variation in the coloration and shape of the wings of this butterfly, in his 'rhopalocera africae australis,' p. 186.) in cases like these, the development of a perfect ocellus does not require a long course of variation and selection. with birds and many other animals, it seems to follow from the comparison of allied species that circular spots are often generated by the breaking up and contraction of stripes. in the tragopan pheasant faint white lines in the female represent the beautiful white spots in the male (49. jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. iii. p. 517.); and something of the same kind may be observed in the two sexes of the argus pheasant. however this may be, appearances strongly favour the belief that on the one hand, a dark spot is often formed by the colouring matter being drawn towards a central point from a surrounding zone, which latter is thus rendered lighter; and, on the other hand, that a white spot is often formed by the colour being driven away from a central point, so that it accumulates in a surrounding darker zone. in either case an ocellus is the result. the colouring matter seems to be a nearly constant quantity, but is redistributed, either centripetally or centrifugally. the feathers of the common guinea-fowl offer a good instance of white spots surrounded by darker zones; and wherever the white spots are large and stand near each other, the surrounding dark zones become confluent. in the same wing-feather of the argus pheasant dark spots may be seen surrounded by a pale zone, and white spots by a dark zone. thus the formation of an ocellus in its most elementary state appears to be a simple affair. by what further steps the more complex ocelli, which are surrounded by many successive zones of colour, have been generated, i will not pretend to say. but the zoned feathers of the mongrels from differently coloured fowls, and the extraordinary variability of the ocelli on many lepidoptera, lead us to conclude that their formation is not a complex process, but depends on some slight and graduated change in the nature of the adjoining tissues. gradation of secondary sexual characters. [fig. 54. feather of peacock, about two-thirds of natural size, drawn by mr. ford. the transparent zone is represented by the outermost white zone, confined to the upper end of the disc.] cases of gradation are important, as shewing us that highly complex ornaments may be acquired by small successive steps. in order to discover the actual steps by which the male of any existing bird has acquired his magnificent colours or other ornaments, we ought to behold the long line of his extinct progenitors; but this is obviously impossible. we may, however, generally gain a clue by comparing all the species of the same group, if it be a large one; for some of them will probably retain, at least partially, traces of their former characters. instead of entering on tedious details respecting various groups, in which striking instances of gradation could be given, it seems the best plan to take one or two strongly marked cases, for instance that of the peacock, in order to see if light can be thrown on the steps by which this bird has become so splendidly decorated. the peacock is chiefly remarkable from the extraordinary length of his tail-coverts; the tail itself not being much elongated. the barbs along nearly the whole length of these feathers stand separate or are decomposed; but this is the case with the feathers of many species, and with some varieties of the domestic fowl and pigeon. the barbs coalesce towards the extremity of the shaft forming the oval disc or ocellus, which is certainly one of the most beautiful objects in the world. it consists of an iridescent, intensely blue, indented centre, surrounded by a rich green zone, this by a broad coppery-brown zone, and this by five other narrow zones of slightly different iridescent shades. a trifling character in the disc deserves notice; the barbs, for a space along one of the concentric zones are more or less destitute of their barbules, so that a part of the disc is surrounded by an almost transparent zone, which gives it a highly finished aspect. but i have elsewhere described (50. 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. i. p. 254.) an exactly analogous variation in the hackles of a sub-variety of the game- cock, in which the tips, having a metallic lustre, "are separated from the lower part of the feather by a symmetrically shaped transparent zone, composed of the naked portions of the barbs." the lower margin or base of the dark-blue centre of the ocellus is deeply indented on the line of the shaft. the surrounding zones likewise shew traces, as may be seen in the drawing (fig. 54), of indentations, or rather breaks. these indentations are common to the indian and javan peacocks (pavo cristatus and p. muticus); and they seem to deserve particular attention, as probably connected with the development of the ocellus; but for a long time i could not conjecture their meaning. if we admit the principle of gradual evolution, there must formerly have existed many species which presented every successive step between the wonderfully elongated tail-coverts of the peacock and the short tail- coverts of all ordinary birds; and again between the magnificent ocelli of the former, and the simpler ocelli or mere coloured spots on other birds; and so with all the other characters of the peacock. let us look to the allied gallinaceae for any still-existing gradations. the species and sub- species of polyplectron inhabit countries adjacent to the native land of the peacock; and they so far resemble this bird that they are sometimes called peacock-pheasants. i am also informed by mr. bartlett that they resemble the peacock in their voice and in some of their habits. during the spring the males, as previously described, strut about before the comparatively plain-coloured females, expanding and erecting their tail and wing-feathers, which are ornamented with numerous ocelli. i request the reader to turn back to the drawing (fig. 51) of a polyplectron; in p. napoleonis the ocelli are confined to the tail, and the back is of a rich metallic blue; in which respects this species approaches the java peacock. p. hardwickii possesses a peculiar top-knot, which is also somewhat like that of the java peacock. in all the species the ocelli on the wings and tail are either circular or oval, and consist of a beautiful, iridescent, greenish-blue or greenish-purple disc, with a black border. this border in p. chinquis shades into brown, edged with cream colour, so that the ocellus is here surrounded with variously shaded, though not bright, concentric zones. the unusual length of the tail-coverts is another remarkable character in polyplectron; for in some of the species they are half, and in others two-thirds as long as the true tail-feathers. the tail-coverts are ocellated as in the peacock. thus the several species of polyplectron manifestly make a graduated approach to the peacock in the length of their tail-coverts, in the zoning of the ocelli, and in some other characters. [fig. 55. part of a tail-covert of polyplectron chinquis, with the two ocelli of natural size. fig. 56. part of a tail-covert of polyplectron malaccense, with the two ocelli, partially confluent, of natural size.] notwithstanding this approach, the first species of polyplectron which i examined almost made me give up the search; for i found not only that the true tail-feathers, which in the peacock are quite plain, were ornamented with ocelli, but that the ocelli on all the feathers differed fundamentally from those of the peacock, in there being two on the same feather (fig. 55), one on each side of the shaft. hence i concluded that the early progenitors of the peacock could not have resembled a polyplectron. but on continuing my search, i observed that in some of the species the two ocelli stood very near each other; that in the tail-feathers of p. hardwickii they touched each other; and, finally, that on the tail-coverts of this same species as well as of p. malaccense (fig. 56) they were actually confluent. as the central part alone is confluent, an indentation is left at both the upper and lower ends; and the surrounding coloured zones are likewise indented. a single ocellus is thus formed on each tail-covert, though still plainly betraying its double origin. these confluent ocelli differ from the single ocelli of the peacock in having an indentation at both ends, instead of only at the lower or basal end. the explanation, however, of this difference is not difficult; in some species of polyplectron the two oval ocelli on the same feather stand parallel to each other; in other species (as in p. chinquis) they converge towards one end; now the partial confluence of two convergent ocelli would manifestly leave a much deeper indentation at the divergent than at the convergent end. it is also manifest that if the convergence were strongly pronounced and the confluence complete, the indentation at the convergent end would tend to disappear. the tail-feathers in both species of the peacock are entirely destitute of ocelli, and this apparently is related to their being covered up and concealed by the long tail-coverts. in this respect they differ remarkably from the tail-feathers of polyplectron, which in most of the species are ornamented with larger ocelli than those on the tail-coverts. hence i was led carefully to examine the tail-feathers of the several species, in order to discover whether their ocelli shewed any tendency to disappear; and to my great satisfaction, this appeared to be so. the central tail-feathers of p. napoleonis have the two ocelli on each side of the shaft perfectly developed; but the inner ocellus becomes less and less conspicuous on the more exterior tail-feathers, until a mere shadow or rudiment is left on the inner side of the outermost feather. again, in p. malaccense, the ocelli on the tail-coverts are, as we have seen, confluent; and these feathers are of unusual length, being two-thirds of the length of the tail-feathers, so that in both these respects they approach the tail-coverts of the peacock. now in p. malaccense, the two central tail-feathers alone are ornamented, each with two brightly-coloured ocelli, the inner ocellus having completely disappeared from all the other tail-feathers. consequently the tail- coverts and tail-feathers of this species of polyplectron make a near approach in structure and ornamentation to the corresponding feathers of the peacock. as far, then, as gradation throws light on the steps by which the magnificent train of the peacock has been acquired, hardly anything more is needed. if we picture to ourselves a progenitor of the peacock in an almost exactly intermediate condition between the existing peacock, with his enormously elongated tail-coverts, ornamented with single ocelli, and an ordinary gallinaceous bird with short tail-coverts, merely spotted with some colour, we shall see a bird allied to polyplectron--that is, with tail-coverts, capable of erection and expansion, ornamented with two partially confluent ocelli, and long enough almost to conceal the tail- feathers, the latter having already partially lost their ocelli. the indentation of the central disc and of the surrounding zones of the ocellus, in both species of peacock, speaks plainly in favour of this view, and is otherwise inexplicable. the males of polyplectron are no doubt beautiful birds, but their beauty, when viewed from a little distance, cannot be compared with that of the peacock. many female progenitors of the peacock must, during a long line of descent, have appreciated this superiority; for they have unconsciously, by the continued preference for the most beautiful males, rendered the peacock the most splendid of living birds. argus pheasant. another excellent case for investigation is offered by the ocelli on the wing-feathers of the argus pheasant, which are shaded in so wonderful a manner as to resemble balls lying loose within sockets, and consequently differ from ordinary ocelli. no one, i presume, will attribute the shading, which has excited the admiration of many experienced artists, to chance--to the fortuitous concourse of atoms of colouring matter. that these ornaments should have been formed through the selection of many successive variations, not one of which was originally intended to produce the ball-and-socket effect, seems as incredible as that one of raphael's madonnas should have been formed by the selection of chance daubs of paint made by a long succession of young artists, not one of whom intended at first to draw the human figure. in order to discover how the ocelli have been developed, we cannot look to a long line of progenitors, nor to many closely-allied forms, for such do not now exist. but fortunately the several feathers on the wing suffice to give us a clue to the problem, and they prove to demonstration that a gradation is at least possible from a mere spot to a finished ball-and-socket ocellus. [fig. 57. part of secondary wing-feather of argus pheasant, shewing two perfect ocelli, a and b. a, b, c, d, etc., are dark stripes running obliquely down, each to an ocellus. [much of the web on both sides, especially to the left of the shaft, has been cut off.] fig.59. portion of one of the secondary wing-feathers near to the body, shewing the so-called elliptic ornaments. the right-hand figure is given merely as a diagram for the sake of the letters of reference. a, b, c, d, etc. rows of spots running down to and forming the elliptic ornaments. b. lowest spot or mark in row b. c. the next succeeding spot or mark in the same row. d. apparently a broken prolongation of the spot c. in the same row b.] the wing-feathers, bearing the ocelli, are covered with dark stripes (fig. 57) or with rows of dark spots (fig. 59), each stripe or row of spots running obliquely down the outer side of the shaft to one of the ocelli. the spots are generally elongated in a line transverse to the row in which they stand. they often become confluent either in the line of the row--and then they form a longitudinal stripe--or transversely, that is, with the spots in the adjoining rows, and then they form transverse stripes. a spot sometimes breaks up into smaller spots, which still stand in their proper places. it will be convenient first to describe a perfect ball-and-socket ocellus. this consists of an intensely black circular ring, surrounding a space shaded so as exactly to resemble a ball. the figure here given has been admirably drawn by mr. ford and well engraved, but a woodcut cannot exhibit the exquisite shading of the original. the ring is almost always slightly broken or interrupted (fig. 57) at a point in the upper half, a little to the right of and above the white shade on the enclosed ball; it is also sometimes broken towards the base on the right hand. these little breaks have an important meaning. the ring is always much thickened, with the edges ill-defined towards the left-hand upper corner, the feather being held erect, in the position in which it is here drawn. beneath this thickened part there is on the surface of the ball an oblique almost pure- white mark, which shades off downwards into a pale-leaden hue, and this into yellowish and brown tints, which insensibly become darker and darker towards the lower part of the ball. it is this shading which gives so admirably the effect of light shining on a convex surface. if one of the balls be examined, it will be seen that the lower part is of a brown tint and is indistinctly separated by a curved oblique line from the upper part, which is yellower and more leaden; this curved oblique line runs at right angles to the longer axis of the white patch of light, and indeed of all the shading; but this difference in colour, which cannot of course be shewn in the woodcut, does not in the least interfere with the perfect shading of the ball. it should be particularly observed that each ocellus stands in obvious connection either with a dark stripe, or with a longitudinal row of dark spots, for both occur indifferently on the same feather. thus in fig. 57 stripe a runs to ocellus a; b runs to ocellus b; stripe c is broken in the upper part, and runs down to the next succeeding ocellus, not represented in the woodcut; d to the next lower one, and so with the stripes e and f. lastly, the several ocelli are separated from each other by a pale surface bearing irregular black marks. [fig. 58. basal part of the secondary wing feather, nearest to the body.] i will next describe the other extreme of the series, namely, the first trace of an ocellus. the short secondary wing-feather (fig. 58), nearest to the body, is marked like the other feathers, with oblique, longitudinal, rather irregular, rows of very dark spots. the basal spot, or that nearest the shaft, in the five lower rows (excluding the lowest one) is a little larger than the other spots of the same row, and a little more elongated in a transverse direction. it differs also from the other spots by being bordered on its upper side with some dull fulvous shading. but this spot is not in any way more remarkable than those on the plumage of many birds, and might easily be overlooked. the next higher spot does not differ at all from the upper ones in the same row. the larger basal spots occupy exactly the same relative position on these feathers as do the perfect ocelli on the longer wing-feathers. by looking to the next two or three succeeding wing-feathers, an absolutely insensible gradation can be traced from one of the last-described basal spots, together with the next higher one in the same row, to a curious ornament, which cannot be called an ocellus, and which i will name, from the want of a better term, an "elliptic ornament." these are shewn in the accompanying figure (fig. 59). we here see several oblique rows, a, b, c, d, etc. (see the lettered diagram on the right hand), of dark spots of the usual character. each row of spots runs down to and is connected with one of the elliptic ornaments, in exactly the same manner as each stripe in fig. 57 runs down to and is connected with one of the ball-and-socket ocelli. looking to any one row, for instance, b, in fig. 59, the lowest mark (b) is thicker and considerably longer than the upper spots, and has its left extremity pointed and curved upwards. this black mark is abruptly bordered on its upper side by a rather broad space of richly shaded tints, beginning with a narrow brown zone, which passes into orange, and this into a pale leaden tint, with the end towards the shaft much paler. these shaded tints together fill up the whole inner space of the elliptic ornament. the mark (b) corresponds in every respect with the basal shaded spot of the simple feather described in the last paragraph (fig. 58), but is more highly developed and more brightly coloured. above and to the right of this spot (b, fig. 59), with its bright shading, there is a long narrow, black mark (c), belonging to the same row, and which is arched a little downwards so as to face (b). this mark is sometimes broken into two portions. it is also narrowly edged on the lower side with a fulvous tint. to the left of and above c, in the same oblique direction, but always more or less distinct from it, there is another black mark (d). this mark is generally sub-triangular and irregular in shape, but in the one lettered in the diagram it is unusually narrow, elongated, and regular. it apparently consists of a lateral and broken prolongation of the mark (c), together with its confluence with a broken and prolonged part of the next spot above; but i do not feel sure of this. these three marks, b, c, and d, with the intervening bright shades, form together the so-called elliptic ornament. these ornaments placed parallel to the shaft, manifestly correspond in position with the ball-and-socket ocelli. their extremely elegant appearance cannot be appreciated in the drawing, as the orange and leaden tints, contrasting so well with the black marks, cannot be shewn. [fig. 60. an ocellus in an intermediate condition between the elliptic ornament and the perfect ball-and-socket ocellus.] between one of the elliptic ornaments and a perfect ball-and-socket ocellus, the gradation is so perfect that it is scarcely possible to decide when the latter term ought to be used. the passage from the one into the other is effected by the elongation and greater curvature in opposite directions of the lower black mark (b, fig. 59), and more especially of the upper one (c), together with the contraction of the elongated sub- triangular or narrow mark (d), so that at last these three marks become confluent, forming an irregular elliptic ring. this ring is gradually rendered more and more circular and regular, increasing at the same time in diameter. i have here given a drawing (fig. 60) of the natural size of an ocellus not as yet quite perfect. the lower part of the black ring is much more curved than is the lower mark in the elliptic ornament (b, fig. 59). the upper part of the ring consists of two or three separate portions; and there is only a trace of the thickening of the portion which forms the black mark above the white shade. this white shade itself is not as yet much concentrated; and beneath it the surface is brighter coloured than in a perfect ball-and-socket ocellus. even in the most perfect ocelli traces of the junction of three or four elongated black marks, by which the ring has been formed, may often be detected. the irregular sub-triangular or narrow mark (d, fig. 59), manifestly forms, by its contraction and equalisation, the thickened portion of the ring above the white shade on a perfect ball-and-socket ocellus. the lower part of the ring is invariably a little thicker than the other parts (fig. 57), and this follows from the lower black mark of the elliptic ornament (b, fig. 59) having originally been thicker than the upper mark (c). every step can be followed in the process of confluence and modification; and the black ring which surrounds the ball of the ocellus is unquestionably formed by the union and modification of the three black marks, b, c, d, of the elliptic ornament. the irregular zigzag black marks between the successive ocelli (fig. 57) are plainly due to the breaking up of the somewhat more regular but similar marks between the elliptic ornaments. the successive steps in the shading of the ball-and-socket ocelli can be followed out with equal clearness. the brown, orange, and pale-leadened narrow zones, which border the lower black mark of the elliptic ornament, can be seen gradually to become more and more softened and shaded into each other, with the upper lighter part towards the left-hand corner rendered still lighter, so as to become almost white, and at the same time more contracted. but even in the most perfect ball-and-socket ocelli a slight difference in the tints, though not in the shading, between the upper and lower parts of the ball can be perceived, as before noticed; and the line of separation is oblique, in the same direction as the bright coloured shades of the elliptic ornaments. thus almost every minute detail in the shape and colouring of the ball-and-socket ocelli can be shewn to follow from gradual changes in the elliptic ornaments; and the development of the latter can be traced by equally small steps from the union of two almost simple spots, the lower one (fig. 58) having some dull fulvous shading on its upper side. [fig. 61. portion near summit of one of the secondary wing-feathers, bearing perfect ball-and-socket ocelli. a. ornamented upper part. b. uppermost, imperfect ball-and-socket ocellus. (the shading above the white mark on the summit of the ocellus is here a little too dark.) c. perfect ocellus.] the extremities of the longer secondary feathers which bear the perfect ball-and-socket ocelli, are peculiarly ornamented (fig. 61). the oblique longitudinal stripes suddenly cease upwards and become confused; and above this limit the whole upper end of the feather (a) is covered with white dots, surrounded by little black rings, standing on a dark ground. the oblique stripe belonging to the uppermost ocellus (b) is barely represented by a very short irregular black mark with the usual, curved, transverse base. as this stripe is thus abruptly cut off, we can perhaps understand from what has gone before, how it is that the upper thickened part of the ring is here absent; for, as before stated, this thickened part apparently stands in some relation with a broken prolongation from the next higher spot. from the absence of the upper and thickened part of the ring, the uppermost ocellus, though perfect in all other respects, appears as if its top had been obliquely sliced off. it would, i think, perplex any one, who believes that the plumage of the argus pheasant was created as we now see it, to account for the imperfect condition of the uppermost ocellus. i should add that on the secondary wing-feather farthest from the body all the ocelli are smaller and less perfect than on the other feathers, and have the upper part of the ring deficient, as in the case just mentioned. the imperfection here seems to be connected with the fact that the spots on this feather shew less tendency than usual to become confluent into stripes; they are, on the contrary, often broken up into smaller spots, so that two or three rows run down to the same ocellus. there still remains another very curious point, first observed by mr. t.w. wood (51. the 'field,' may 28, 1870.), which deserves attention. in a photograph, given me by mr. ward, of a specimen mounted as in the act of display, it may be seen that on the feathers which are held perpendicularly, the white marks on the ocelli, representing light reflected from a convex surface, are at the upper or further end, that is, are directed upwards; and the bird whilst displaying himself on the ground would naturally be illuminated from above. but here comes the curious point; the outer feathers are held almost horizontally, and their ocelli ought likewise to appear as if illuminated from above, and consequently the white marks ought to be placed on the upper sides of the ocelli; and, wonderful as is the fact, they are thus placed! hence the ocelli on the several feathers, though occupying very different positions with respect to the light, all appear as if illuminated from above, just as an artist would have shaded them. nevertheless they are not illuminated from strictly the same point as they ought to be; for the white marks on the ocelli of the feathers which are held almost horizontally, are placed rather too much towards the further end; that is, they are not sufficiently lateral. we have, however, no right to expect absolute perfection in a part rendered ornamental through sexual selection, any more than we have in a part modified through natural selection for real use; for instance, in that wondrous organ the human eye. and we know what helmholtz, the highest authority in europe on the subject, has said about the human eye; that if an optician had sold him an instrument so carelessly made, he would have thought himself fully justified in returning it. (52. 'popular lectures on scientific subjects,' eng. trans. 1873, pp. 219, 227, 269, 390.) we have now seen that a perfect series can be followed, from simple spots to the wonderful ball-and-socket ornaments. mr. gould, who kindly gave me some of these feathers, fully agrees with me in the completeness of the gradation. it is obvious that the stages in development exhibited by the feathers on the same bird do not at all necessarily shew us the steps passed through by the extinct progenitors of the species; but they probably give us the clue to the actual steps, and they at least prove to demonstration that a gradation is possible. bearing in mind how carefully the male argus pheasant displays his plumes before the female, as well as the many facts rendering it probable that female birds prefer the more attractive males, no one who admits the agency of sexual selection in any case will deny that a simple dark spot with some fulvous shading might be converted, through the approximation and modification of two adjoining spots, together with some slight increase of colour, into one of the so- called elliptic ornaments. these latter ornaments have been shewn to many persons, and all have admitted that they are beautiful, some thinking them even more so than the ball-and-socket ocelli. as the secondary plumes became lengthened through sexual selection, and as the elliptic ornaments increased in diameter, their colours apparently became less bright; and then the ornamentation of the plumes had to be gained by an improvement in the pattern and shading; and this process was carried on until the wonderful ball-and-socket ocelli were finally developed. thus we can understand--and in no other way as it seems to me--the present condition and origin of the ornaments on the wing-feathers of the argus pheasant. from the light afforded by the principle of gradation--from what we know of the laws of variation--from the changes which have taken place in many of our domesticated birds--and, lastly, from the character (as we shall hereafter see more clearly) of the immature plumage of young birds--we can sometimes indicate, with a certain amount of confidence, the probable steps by which the males have acquired their brilliant plumage and various ornaments; yet in many cases we are involved in complete darkness. mr. gould several years ago pointed out to me a humming-bird, the urosticte benjamini, remarkable for the curious differences between the sexes. the male, besides a splendid gorget, has greenish-black tail-feathers, with the four central ones tipped with white; in the female, as with most of the allied species, the three outer tail-feathers on each side are tipped with white, so that the male has the four central, whilst the female has the six exterior feathers ornamented with white tips. what makes the case more curious is that, although the colouring of the tail differs remarkably in both sexes of many kinds of humming-birds, mr. gould does not know a single species, besides the urosticte, in which the male has the four central feathers tipped with white. the duke of argyll, in commenting on this case (53. 'the reign of law,' 1867, p. 247.), passes over sexual selection, and asks, "what explanation does the law of natural selection give of such specific varieties as these?" he answers "none whatever"; and i quite agree with him. but can this be so confidently said of sexual selection? seeing in how many ways the tail-feathers of humming-birds differ, why should not the four central feathers have varied in this one species alone, so as to have acquired white tips? the variations may have been gradual, or somewhat abrupt as in the case recently given of the humming-birds near bogota, in which certain individuals alone have the "central tail-feathers tipped with beautiful green." in the female of the urosticte i noticed extremely minute or rudimental white tips to the two outer of the four central black tail- feathers; so that here we have an indication of change of some kind in the plumage of this species. if we grant the possibility of the central tail- feathers of the male varying in whiteness, there is nothing strange in such variations having been sexually selected. the white tips, together with the small white ear-tufts, certainly add, as the duke of argyll admits, to the beauty of the male; and whiteness is apparently appreciated by other birds, as may be inferred from such cases as the snow-white male of the bell-bird. the statement made by sir r. heron should not be forgotten, namely, that his peahens, when debarred from access to the pied peacock, would not unite with any other male, and during that season produced no offspring. nor is it strange that variations in the tail-feathers of the urosticte should have been specially selected for the sake of ornament, for the next succeeding genus in the family takes its name of metallura from the splendour of these feathers. we have, moreover, good evidence that humming-birds take especial pains in displaying their tail-feathers; mr. belt (54. 'the naturalist in nicaragua,' 1874, p. 112.), after describing the beauty of the florisuga mellivora, says, "i have seen the female sitting on a branch, and two males displaying their charms in front of her. one would shoot up like a rocket, then suddenly expanding the snow-white tail, like an inverted parachute, slowly descend in front of her, turning round gradually to shew off back and front...the expanded white tail covered more space than all the rest of the bird, and was evidently the grand feature in the performance. whilst one male was descending, the other would shoot up and come slowly down expanded. the entertainment would end in a fight between the two performers; but whether the most beautiful or the most pugnacious was the accepted suitor, i know not." mr. gould, after describing the peculiar plumage of the urosticte, adds, "that ornament and variety is the sole object, i have myself but little doubt." (55. 'introduction to the trochilidae,' 1861, p. 110.) if this be admitted, we can perceive that the males which during former times were decked in the most elegant and novel manner would have gained an advantage, not in the ordinary struggle for life, but in rivalry with other males, and would have left a larger number of offspring to inherit their newly- acquired beauty. chapter xv. birds--continued. discussion as to why the males alone of some species, and both sexes of others, are brightly coloured--on sexually-limited inheritance, as applied to various structures and to brightly-coloured plumage--nidification in relation to colour--loss of nuptial plumage during the winter. we have in this chapter to consider why the females of many birds have not acquired the same ornaments as the male; and why, on the other hand, both sexes of many other birds are equally, or almost equally, ornamented? in the following chapter we shall consider the few cases in which the female is more conspicuously coloured than the male. in my 'origin of species' (1. fourth edition, 1866, p. 241.) i briefly suggested that the long tail of the peacock would be inconvenient and the conspicuous black colour of the male capercailzie dangerous, to the female during the period of incubation: and consequently that the transmission of these characters from the male to the female offspring had been checked through natural selection. i still think that this may have occurred in some few instances: but after mature reflection on all the facts which i have been able to collect, i am now inclined to believe that when the sexes differ, the successive variations have generally been from the first limited in their transmission to the same sex in which they first arose. since my remarks appeared, the subject of sexual coloration has been discussed in some very interesting papers by mr. wallace (2. 'westminster review,' july 1867. 'journal of travel,' vol. i. 1868, p. 73.), who believes that in almost all cases the successive variations tended at first to be transmitted equally to both sexes; but that the female was saved, through natural selection, from acquiring the conspicuous colours of the male, owing to the danger which she would thus have incurred during incubation. this view necessitates a tedious discussion on a difficult point, namely, whether the transmission of a character, which is at first inherited by both sexes can be subsequently limited in its transmission to one sex alone by means of natural selection. we must bear in mind, as shewn in the preliminary chapter on sexual selection, that characters which are limited in their development to one sex are always latent in the other. an imaginary illustration will best aid us in seeing the difficulty of the case; we may suppose that a fancier wished to make a breed of pigeons, in which the males alone should be coloured of a pale blue, whilst the females retained their former slaty tint. as with pigeons characters of all kinds are usually transmitted to both sexes equally, the fancier would have to try to convert this latter form of inheritance into sexually-limited transmission. all that he could do would be to persevere in selecting every male pigeon which was in the least degree of a paler blue; and the natural result of this process, if steadily carried on for a long time, and if the pale variations were strongly inherited or often recurred, would be to make his whole stock of a lighter blue. but our fancier would be compelled to match, generation after generation, his pale blue males with slaty females, for he wishes to keep the latter of this colour. the result would generally be the production either of a mongrel piebald lot, or more probably the speedy and complete loss of the pale-blue tint; for the primordial slaty colour would be transmitted with prepotent force. supposing, however, that some pale-blue males and slaty females were produced during each successive generation, and were always crossed together, then the slaty females would have, if i may use the expression, much blue blood in their veins, for their fathers, grandfathers, etc., will all have been blue birds. under these circumstances it is conceivable (though i know of no distinct facts rendering it probable) that the slaty females might acquire so strong a latent tendency to pale-blueness, that they would not destroy this colour in their male offspring, their female offspring still inheriting the slaty tint. if so, the desired end of making a breed with the two sexes permanently different in colour might be gained. the extreme importance, or rather necessity in the above case of the desired character, namely, pale-blueness, being present though in a latent state in the female, so that the male offspring should not be deteriorated, will be best appreciated as follows: the male of soemmerring's pheasant has a tail thirty-seven inches in length, whilst that of the female is only eight inches; the tail of the male common pheasant is about twenty inches, and that of the female twelve inches long. now if the female soemmerring pheasant with her short tail were crossed with the male common pheasant, there can be no doubt that the male hybrid offspring would have a much longer tail than that of the pure offspring of the common pheasant. on the other hand, if the female common pheasant, with a tail much longer than that of the female soemmerring pheasant, were crossed with the male of the latter, the male hybrid offspring would have a much shorter tail than that of the pure offspring of soemmerring's pheasant. (3. temminck says that the tail of the female phasianus soemmerringii is only six inches long, 'planches coloriees,' vol. v. 1838, pp. 487 and 488: the measurements above given were made for me by mr. sclater. for the common pheasant, see macgillivray, 'history of british birds,' vol. i. pp. 118-121.) our fancier, in order to make his new breed with the males of a pale-blue tint, and the females unchanged, would have to continue selecting the males during many generations; and each stage of paleness would have to be fixed in the males, and rendered latent in the females. the task would be an extremely difficult one, and has never been tried, but might possibly be successfully carried out. the chief obstacle would be the early and complete loss of the pale-blue tint, from the necessity of reiterated crosses with the slaty female, the latter not having at first any latent tendency to produce pale-blue offspring. on the other hand, if one or two males were to vary ever so slightly in paleness, and the variations were from the first limited in their transmission to the male sex, the task of making a new breed of the desired kind would be easy, for such males would simply have to be selected and matched with ordinary females. an analogous case has actually occurred, for there are breeds of the pigeon in belgium (4. dr. chapuis, 'le pigeon voyageur belge,' 1865, p. 87.) in which the males alone are marked with black striae. so again mr. tegetmeier has recently shewn (5. the 'field,' sept. 1872.) that dragons not rarely produce silver-coloured birds, which are almost always hens; and he himself has bred ten such females. it is on the other hand a very unusual event when a silver male is produced; so that nothing would be easier, if desired, than to make a breed of dragons with blue males and silver females. this tendency is indeed so strong that when mr. tegetmeier at last got a silver male and matched him with one of the silver females, he expected to get a breed with both sexes thus coloured; he was however disappointed, for the young male reverted to the blue colour of his grandfather, the young female alone being silver. no doubt with patience this tendency to reversion in the males, reared from an occasional silver male matched with a silver hen, might be eliminated, and then both sexes would be coloured alike; and this very process has been followed with success by mr. esquilant in the case of silver turbits. with fowls, variations of colour, limited in their transmission to the male sex, habitually occur. when this form of inheritance prevails, it might well happen that some of the successive variations would be transferred to the female, who would then slightly resemble the male, as actually occurs in some breeds. or again, the greater number, but not all, of the successive steps might be transferred to both sexes, and the female would then closely resemble the male. there can hardly be a doubt that this is the cause of the male pouter pigeon having a somewhat larger crop, and of the male carrier pigeon having somewhat larger wattles, than their respective females; for fanciers have not selected one sex more than the other, and have had no wish that these characters should be more strongly displayed in the male than in the female, yet this is the case with both breeds. the same process would have to be followed, and the same difficulties encountered, if it were desired to make a breed with the females alone of some new colour. lastly, our fancier might wish to make a breed with the two sexes differing from each other, and both from the parent species. here the difficulty would be extreme, unless the successive variations were from the first sexually limited on both sides, and then there would be no difficulty. we see this with the fowl; thus the two sexes of the pencilled hamburghs differ greatly from each other, and from the two sexes of the aboriginal gallus bankiva; and both are now kept constant to their standard of excellence by continued selection, which would be impossible unless the distinctive characters of both were limited in their transmission. the spanish fowl offers a more curious case; the male has an immense comb, but some of the successive variations, by the accumulation of which it was acquired, appear to have been transferred to the female; for she has a comb many times larger than that of the females of the parent species. but the comb of the female differs in one respect from that of the male, for it is apt to lop over; and within a recent period it has been ordered by the fancy that this should always be the case, and success has quickly followed the order. now the lopping of the comb must be sexually limited in its transmission, otherwise it would prevent the comb of the male from being perfectly upright, which would be abhorrent to every fancier. on the other hand, the uprightness of the comb in the male must likewise be a sexually- limited character, otherwise it would prevent the comb of the female from lopping over. from the foregoing illustrations, we see that even with almost unlimited time at command, it would be an extremely difficult and complex, perhaps an impossible process, to change one form of transmission into the other through selection. therefore, without distinct evidence in each case, i am unwilling to admit that this has been effected in natural species. on the other hand, by means of successive variations, which were from the first sexually limited in their transmission, there would not be the least difficulty in rendering a male bird widely different in colour or in any other character from the female; the latter being left unaltered, or slightly altered, or specially modified for the sake of protection. as bright colours are of service to the males in their rivalry with other males, such colours would be selected whether or not they were transmitted exclusively to the same sex. consequently the females might be expected often to partake of the brightness of the males to a greater or less degree; and this occurs with a host of species. if all the successive variations were transmitted equally to both sexes, the females would be indistinguishable from the males; and this likewise occurs with many birds. if, however, dull colours were of high importance for the safety of the female during incubation, as with many ground birds, the females which varied in brightness, or which received through inheritance from the males any marked accession of brightness, would sooner or later be destroyed. but the tendency in the males to continue for an indefinite period transmitting to their female offspring their own brightness, would have to be eliminated by a change in the form of inheritance; and this, as shewn by our previous illustration, would be extremely difficult. the more probable result of the long-continued destruction of the more brightly-coloured females, supposing the equal form of transmission to prevail, would be the lessening or annihilation of the bright colours of the males, owing to their continual crossing with the duller females. it would be tedious to follow out all the other possible results; but i may remind the reader that if sexually-limited variations in brightness occurred in the females, even if they were not in the least injurious to them and consequently were not eliminated, yet they would not be favoured or selected, for the male usually accepts any female, and does not select the more attractive individuals; consequently these variations would be liable to be lost, and would have little influence on the character of the race; and this will aid in accounting for the females being commonly duller-coloured than the males. in the eighth chapter instances were given, to which many might here be added, of variations occurring at various ages, and inherited at the corresponding age. it was also shewn that variations which occur late in life are commonly transmitted to the same sex in which they first appear; whilst variations occurring early in life are apt to be transmitted to both sexes; not that all the cases of sexually-limited transmission can thus be accounted for. it was further shewn that if a male bird varied by becoming brighter whilst young, such variations would be of no service until the age for reproduction had arrived, and there was competition between rival males. but in the case of birds living on the ground and commonly in need of the protection of dull colours, bright tints would be far more dangerous to the young and inexperienced than to the adult males. consequently the males which varied in brightness whilst young would suffer much destruction and be eliminated through natural selection; on the other hand, the males which varied in this manner when nearly mature, notwithstanding that they were exposed to some additional danger, might survive, and from being favoured through sexual selection, would procreate their kind. as a relation often exists between the period of variation and the form of transmission, if the bright-coloured young males were destroyed and the mature ones were successful in their courtship, the males alone would acquire brilliant colours and would transmit them exclusively to their male offspring. but i by no means wish to maintain that the influence of age on the form of transmission, is the sole cause of the great difference in brilliancy between the sexes of many birds. when the sexes of birds differ in colour, it is interesting to determine whether the males alone have been modified by sexual selection, the females having been left unchanged, or only partially and indirectly thus changed; or whether the females have been specially modified through natural selection for the sake of protection. i will therefore discuss this question at some length, even more fully than its intrinsic importance deserves; for various curious collateral points may thus be conveniently considered. before we enter on the subject of colour, more especially in reference to mr. wallace's conclusions, it may be useful to discuss some other sexual differences under a similar point of view. a breed of fowls formerly existed in germany (6. bechstein, 'naturgeschichte deutschlands,' 1793, b. iii. 339.) in which the hens were furnished with spurs; they were good layers, but they so greatly disturbed their nests with their spurs that they could not be allowed to sit on their own eggs. hence at one time it appeared to me probable that with the females of the wild gallinaceae the development of spurs had been checked through natural selection, from the injury thus caused to their nests. this seemed all the more probable, as wing-spurs, which would not be injurious during incubation, are often as well-developed in the female as in the male; though in not a few cases they are rather larger in the male. when the male is furnished with leg-spurs the female almost always exhibits rudiments of them,--the rudiment sometimes consisting of a mere scale, as in gallus. hence it might be argued that the females had aboriginally been furnished with well-developed spurs, but that these had subsequently been lost through disuse or natural selection. but if this view be admitted, it would have to be extended to innumerable other cases; and it implies that the female progenitors of the existing spur-bearing species were once encumbered with an injurious appendage. in some few genera and species, as in galloperdix, acomus, and the javan peacock (pavo muticus), the females, as well as the males, possess well- developed leg-spurs. are we to infer from this fact that they construct a different sort of nest from that made by their nearest allies, and not liable to be injured by their spurs; so that the spurs have not been removed? or are we to suppose that the females of these several species especially require spurs for their defence? it is a more probable conclusion that both the presence and absence of spurs in the females result from different laws of inheritance having prevailed, independently of natural selection. with the many females in which spurs appear as rudiments, we may conclude that some few of the successive variations, through which they were developed in the males, occurred very early in life, and were consequently transferred to the females. in the other and much rarer cases, in which the females possess fully developed spurs, we may conclude that all the successive variations were transferred to them; and that they gradually acquired and inherited the habit of not disturbing their nests. the vocal organs and the feathers variously modified for producing sound, as well as the proper instincts for using them, often differ in the two sexes, but are sometimes the same in both. can such differences be accounted for by the males having acquired these organs and instincts, whilst the females have been saved from inheriting them, on account of the danger to which they would have been exposed by attracting the attention of birds or beasts of prey? this does not seem to me probable, when we think of the multitude of birds which with impunity gladden the country with their voices during the spring. (7. daines barrington, however, thought it probable ('philosophical transactions,' 1773, p. 164) that few female birds sing, because the talent would have been dangerous to them during incubation. he adds, that a similar view may possibly account for the inferiority of the female to the male in plumage.) it is a safer conclusion that, as vocal and instrumental organs are of special service only to the males during their courtship, these organs were developed through sexual selection and their constant use in that sex alone--the successive variations and the effects of use having been from the first more or less limited in transmission to the male offspring. many analogous cases could be adduced; those for instance of the plumes on the head being generally longer in the male than in the female, sometimes of equal length in both sexes, and occasionally absent in the female,-- these several cases occurring in the same group of birds. it would be difficult to account for such a difference between the sexes by the female having been benefited by possessing a slightly shorter crest than the male, and its consequent diminution or complete suppression through natural selection. but i will take a more favourable case, namely the length of the tail. the long train of the peacock would have been not only inconvenient but dangerous to the peahen during the period of incubation and whilst accompanying her young. hence there is not the least a priori improbability in the development of her tail having been checked through natural selection. but the females of various pheasants, which apparently are exposed on their open nests to as much danger as the peahen, have tails of considerable length. the females as well as the males of the menura superba have long tails, and they build a domed nest, which is a great anomaly in so large a bird. naturalists have wondered how the female menura could manage her tail during incubation; but it is now known (8. mr. ramsay, in 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1868, p. 50.) that she "enters the nest head first, and then turns round with her tail sometimes over her back, but more often bent round by her side. thus in time the tail becomes quite askew, and is a tolerable guide to the length of time the bird has been sitting." both sexes of an australian kingfisher (tanysiptera sylvia) have the middle tail-feathers greatly lengthened, and the female makes her nest in a hole; and as i am informed by mr. r.b. sharpe these feathers become much crumpled during incubation. in these two latter cases the great length of the tail-feathers must be in some degree inconvenient to the female; and as in both species the tail- feathers of the female are somewhat shorter than those of the male, it might be argued that their full development had been prevented through natural selection. but if the development of the tail of the peahen had been checked only when it became inconveniently or dangerously great, she would have retained a much longer tail than she actually possesses; for her tail is not nearly so long, relatively to the size of her body, as that of many female pheasants, nor longer than that of the female turkey. it must also be borne in mind that, in accordance with this view, as soon as the tail of the peahen became dangerously long, and its development was consequently checked, she would have continually reacted on her male progeny, and thus have prevented the peacock from acquiring his present magnificent train. we may therefore infer that the length of the tail in the peacock and its shortness in the peahen are the result of the requisite variations in the male having been from the first transmitted to the male offspring alone. we are led to a nearly similar conclusion with respect to the length of the tail in the various species of pheasants. in the eared pheasant (crossoptilon auritum) the tail is of equal length in both sexes, namely sixteen or seventeen inches; in the common pheasant it is about twenty inches long in the male and twelve in the female; in soemmerring's pheasant, thirty-seven inches in the male and only eight in the female; and lastly in reeve's pheasant it is sometimes actually seventy-two inches long in the male and sixteen in the female. thus in the several species, the tail of the female differs much in length, irrespectively of that of the male; and this can be accounted for, as it seems to me, with much more probability, by the laws of inheritance,--that is by the successive variations having been from the first more or less closely limited in their transmission to the male sex than by the agency of natural selection, resulting from the length of tail being more or less injurious to the females of these several allied species. we may now consider mr. wallace's arguments in regard to the sexual coloration of birds. he believes that the bright tints originally acquired through sexual selection by the males would in all, or almost all cases, have been transmitted to the females, unless the transference had been checked through natural selection. i may here remind the reader that various facts opposed to this view have already been given under reptiles, amphibians, fishes and lepidoptera. mr. wallace rests his belief chiefly, but not exclusively, as we shall see in the next chapter, on the following statement (9. 'journal of travel,' edited by a. murray, vol. i. 1868, p. 78.), that when both sexes are coloured in a very conspicuous manner, the nest is of such a nature as to conceal the sitting bird; but when there is a marked contrast of colour between the sexes, the male being gay and the female dull-coloured, the nest is open and exposes the sitting bird to view. this coincidence, as far as it goes, certainly seems to favour the belief that the females which sit on open nests have been specially modified for the sake of protection; but we shall presently see that there is another and more probable explanation, namely, that conspicuous females have acquired the instinct of building domed nests oftener than dull- coloured birds. mr. wallace admits that there are, as might have been expected, some exceptions to his two rules, but it is a question whether the exceptions are not so numerous as seriously to invalidate them. there is in the first place much truth in the duke of argyll's remark (10. 'journal of travel,' edited by a. murray, vol. i. 1868, p. 281.) that a large domed nest is more conspicuous to an enemy, especially to all tree- haunting carnivorous animals, than a smaller open nest. nor must we forget that with many birds which build open nests, the male sits on the eggs and aids the female in feeding the young: this is the case, for instance, with pyranga aestiva (11. audubon, 'ornithological biography,' vol. i. p. 233.), one of the most splendid birds in the united states, the male being vermilion, and the female light brownish-green. now if brilliant colours had been extremely dangerous to birds whilst sitting on their open nests, the males in these cases would have suffered greatly. it might, however, be of such paramount importance to the male to be brilliantly coloured, in order to beat his rivals, that this may have more than compensated some additional danger. mr. wallace admits that with the king-crows (dicrurus), orioles, and pittidae, the females are conspicuously coloured, yet build open nests; but he urges that the birds of the first group are highly pugnacious and could defend themselves; that those of the second group take extreme care in concealing their open nests, but this does not invariably hold good (12. jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. ii. p. 108. gould's 'handbook of the birds of australia,' vol. i. p. 463.); and that with the birds of the third group the females are brightly coloured chiefly on the under surface. besides these cases, pigeons which are sometimes brightly, and almost always conspicuously coloured, and which are notoriously liable to the attacks of birds of prey, offer a serious exception to the rule, for they almost always build open and exposed nests. in another large family, that of the humming-birds, all the species build open nests, yet with some of the most gorgeous species the sexes are alike; and in the majority, the females, though less brilliant than the males, are brightly coloured. nor can it be maintained that all female humming-birds, which are brightly coloured, escape detection by their tints being green, for some display on their upper surfaces red, blue, and other colours. (13. for instance, the female eupetomena macroura has the head and tail dark blue with reddish loins; the female lampornis porphyrurus is blackish-green on the upper surface, with the lores and sides of the throat crimson; the female eulampis jugularis has the top of the head and back green, but the loins and the tail are crimson. many other instances of highly conspicuous females could be given. see mr. gould's magnificent work on this family.) in regard to birds which build in holes or construct domed nests, other advantages, as mr. wallace remarks, besides concealment are gained, such as shelter from the rain, greater warmth, and in hot countries protection from the sun (14. mr. salvin noticed in guatemala ('ibis,' 1864, p. 375) that humming-birds were much more unwilling to leave their nests during very hot weather, when the sun was shining brightly, as if their eggs would be thus injured, than during cool, cloudy, or rainy weather.); so that it is no valid objection to his view that many birds having both sexes obscurely coloured build concealed nests. (15. i may specify, as instances of dull- coloured birds building concealed nests, the species belonging to eight australian genera described in gould's 'handbook of the birds of australia,' vol. i. pp. 340, 362, 365, 383, 387, 389, 391, 414.) the female horn-bill (buceros), for instance, of india and africa is protected during incubation with extraordinary care, for she plasters up with her own excrement the orifice of the hole in which she sits on her eggs, leaving only a small orifice through which the male feeds her; she is thus kept a close prisoner during the whole period of incubation (16. mr. c. horne, 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1869. p. 243.); yet female horn-bills are not more conspicuously coloured than many other birds of equal size which build open nests. it is a more serious objection to mr. wallace's view, as is admitted by him, that in some few groups the males are brilliantly coloured and the females obscure, and yet the latter hatch their eggs in domed nests. this is the case with the grallinae of australia, the superb warblers (maluridae) of the same country, the sun-birds (nectariniae), and with several of the australian honey-suckers or meliphagidae. (17. on the nidification and colours of these latter species, see gould's 'handbook to the birds of australia,' vol. i. pp. 504, 527.) if we look to the birds of england we shall see that there is no close and general relation between the colours of the female and the nature of the nest which is constructed. about forty of our british birds (excluding those of large size which could defend themselves) build in holes in banks, rocks, or trees, or construct domed nests. if we take the colours of the female goldfinch, bullfinch, or blackbird, as a standard of the degree of conspicuousness, which is not highly dangerous to the sitting female, then out of the above forty birds the females of only twelve can be considered as conspicuous to a dangerous degree, the remaining twenty-eight being inconspicuous. (18. i have consulted, on this subject, macgillivray's 'british birds,' and though doubts may be entertained in some cases in regard to the degree of concealment of the nest, and to the degree of conspicuousness of the female, yet the following birds, which all lay their eggs in holes or in domed nests, can hardly be considered, by the above standard, as conspicuous: passer, 2 species; sturnus, of which the female is considerably less brilliant than the male; cinclus; motallica boarula (?); erithacus (?); fruticola, 2 sp.; saxicola; ruticilla, 2 sp.; sylvia, 3 sp.; parus, 3 sp.; mecistura; anorthura; certhia; sitta; yunx; muscicapa, 2 sp.; hirundo, 3 sp.; and cypselus. the females of the following 12 birds may be considered as conspicuous according to the same standard, viz., pastor, motacilla alba, parus major and p. caeruleus, upupa, picus, 4 sp., coracias, alcedo, and merops.) nor is there any close relation within the same genus between a well-pronounced difference in colour between the sexes, and the nature of the nest constructed. thus the male house sparrow (passer domesticus) differs much from the female, the male tree-sparrow (p. montanus) hardly at all, and yet both build well-concealed nests. the two sexes of the common fly-catcher (muscicapa grisola) can hardly be distinguished, whilst the sexes of the pied fly-catcher (m. luctuosa) differ considerably, and both species build in holes or conceal their nests. the female blackbird (turdus merula) differs much, the female ring- ouzel (t. torquatus) differs less, and the female common thrush (t. musicus) hardly at all from their respective males; yet all build open nests. on the other hand, the not very distantly-allied water-ouzel (cinclus aquaticus) builds a domed nest, and the sexes differ about as much as in the ring-ouzel. the black and red grouse (tetrao tetrix and t. scoticus) build open nests in equally well-concealed spots, but in the one species the sexes differ greatly, and in the other very little. notwithstanding the foregoing objections, i cannot doubt, after reading mr. wallace's excellent essay, that looking to the birds of the world, a large majority of the species in which the females are conspicuously coloured (and in this case the males with rare exceptions are equally conspicuous), build concealed nests for the sake of protection. mr. wallace enumerates (19. 'journal of travel,' edited by a. murray, vol. i. p. 78.) a long series of groups in which this rule holds good; but it will suffice here to give, as instances, the more familiar groups of kingfishers, toucans, trogons, puff-birds (capitonidae), plantain-eaters (musophagae, woodpeckers, and parrots. mr. wallace believes that in these groups, as the males gradually acquired through sexual selection their brilliant colours, these were transferred to the females and were not eliminated by natural selection, owing to the protection which they already enjoyed from their manner of nidification. according to this view, their present manner of nesting was acquired before their present colours. but it seems to me much more probable that in most cases, as the females were gradually rendered more and more brilliant from partaking of the colours of the male, they were gradually led to change their instincts (supposing that they originally built open nests), and to seek protection by building domed or concealed nests. no one who studies, for instance, audubon's account of the differences in the nests of the same species in the northern and southern united states (20. see many statements in the 'ornithological biography.' see also some curious observations on the nests of italian birds by eugenio bettoni, in the 'atti della società italiana,' vol. xi. 1869, p. 487.), will feel any great difficulty in admitting that birds, either by a change (in the strict sense of the word) of their habits, or through the natural selection of so-called spontaneous variations of instinct, might readily be led to modify their manner of nesting. this way of viewing the relation, as far as it holds good, between the bright colours of female birds and their manner of nesting, receives some support from certain cases occurring in the sahara desert. here, as in most other deserts, various birds, and many other animals, have had their colours adapted in a wonderful manner to the tints of the surrounding surface. nevertheless there are, as i am informed by the rev. mr. tristram, some curious exceptions to the rule; thus the male of the monticola cyanea is conspicuous from his bright blue colour, and the female almost equally conspicuous from her mottled brown and white plumage; both sexes of two species of dromolaea are of a lustrous black; so that these three species are far from receiving protection from their colours, yet they are able to survive, for they have acquired the habit of taking refuge from danger in holes or crevices in the rocks. with respect to the above groups in which the females are conspicuously coloured and build concealed nests, it is not necessary to suppose that each separate species had its nidifying instinct specially modified; but only that the early progenitors of each group were gradually led to build domed or concealed nests, and afterwards transmitted this instinct, together with their bright colours, to their modified descendants. as far as it can be trusted, the conclusion is interesting, that sexual selection together with equal or nearly equal inheritance by both sexes, have indirectly determined the manner of nidification of whole groups of birds. according to mr. wallace, even in the groups in which the females, from being protected in domed nests during incubation, have not had their bright colours eliminated through natural selection, the males often differ in a slight, and occasionally in a considerable degree from the females. this is a significant fact, for such differences in colour must be accounted for by some of the variations in the males having been from the first limited in transmission to the same sex; as it can hardly be maintained that these differences, especially when very slight, serve as a protection to the female. thus all the species in the splendid group of the trogons build in holes; and mr. gould gives figures (21. see his monograph of the trogonidae, 1st edition.) of both sexes of twenty-five species, in all of which, with one partial exception, the sexes differ sometimes slightly, sometimes conspicuously, in colour,--the males being always finer than the females, though the latter are likewise beautiful. all the species of kingfishers build in holes, and with most of the species the sexes are equally brilliant, and thus far mr. wallace's rule holds good; but in some of the australian species the colours of the females are rather less vivid than those of the male; and in one splendidly-coloured species, the sexes differ so much that they were at first thought to be specifically distinct. (22. namely, cyanalcyon, gould's 'handbook to the birds of australia,' vol. i. p. 133; see, also, pp. 130, 136.) mr. r.b. sharpe, who has especially studied this group, has shewn me some american species (ceryle) in which the breast of the male is belted with black. again, in carcineutes, the difference between the sexes is conspicuous: in the male the upper surface is dull-blue banded with black, the lower surface being partly fawn-coloured, and there is much red about the head; in the female the upper surface is reddish-brown banded with black, and the lower surface white with black markings. it is an interesting fact, as shewing how the same peculiar style of sexual colouring often characterises allied forms, that in three species of dacelo the male differs from the female only in the tail being dull-blue banded with black, whilst that of the female is brown with blackish bars; so that here the tail differs in colour in the two sexes in exactly the same manner as the whole upper surface in the two sexes of carcineutes. with parrots, which likewise build in holes, we find analogous cases: in most of the species, both sexes are brilliantly coloured and indistinguishable, but in not a few species the males are coloured rather more vividly than the females, or even very differently from them. thus, besides other strongly-marked differences, the whole under surface of the male king lory (aprosmictus scapulatus) is scarlet, whilst the throat and chest of the female is green tinged with red: in the euphema splendida there is a similar difference, the face and wing coverts moreover of the female being of a paler blue than in the male. (23. every gradation of difference between the sexes may be followed in the parrots of australia. see gould's 'handbook,' etc., vol. ii. pp. 14-102.) in the family of the tits (parinae), which build concealed nests, the female of our common blue tomtit (parus caeruleus), is "much less brightly coloured" than the male: and in the magnificent sultan yellow tit of india the difference is greater. (24. macgillivray's 'british birds,' vol. ii. p. 433. jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. ii. p. 282.) again, in the great group of the woodpeckers (25. all the following facts are taken from m. malherbe's magnificent 'monographie des picidees,' 1861.), the sexes are generally nearly alike, but in the megapicus validus all those parts of the head, neck, and breast, which are crimson in the male are pale brown in the female. as in several woodpeckers the head of the male is bright crimson, whilst that of the female is plain, it occurred to me that this colour might possibly make the female dangerously conspicuous, whenever she put her head out of the hole containing her nest, and consequently that this colour, in accordance with mr. wallace's belief, had been eliminated. this view is strengthened by what malherbe states with respect to indopicus carlotta; namely, that the young females, like the young males, have some crimson about their heads, but that this colour disappears in the adult female, whilst it is intensified in the adult male. nevertheless the following considerations render this view extremely doubtful: the male takes a fair share in incubation (26. audubon's 'ornithological biography,' vol. ii. p. 75; see also the 'ibis,' vol. i. p. 268.), and would be thus almost equally exposed to danger; both sexes of many species have their heads of an equally bright crimson; in other species the difference between the sexes in the amount of scarlet is so slight that it can hardly make any appreciable difference in the danger incurred; and lastly, the colouring of the head in the two sexes often differs slightly in other ways. the cases, as yet given, of slight and graduated differences in colour between the males and females in the groups, in which as a general rule the sexes resemble each other, all relate to species which build domed or concealed nests. but similar gradations may likewise be observed in groups in which the sexes as a general rule resemble each other, but which build open nests. as i have before instanced the australian parrots, so i may here instance, without giving any details, the australian pigeons. (27. gould's 'handbook to the birds of australia,' vol. ii. pp. 109-149.) it deserves especial notice that in all these cases the slight differences in plumage between the sexes are of the same general nature as the occasionally greater differences. a good illustration of this fact has already been afforded by those kingfishers in which either the tail alone or the whole upper surface of the plumage differs in the same manner in the two sexes. similar cases may be observed with parrots and pigeons. the differences in colour between the sexes of the same species are, also, of the same general nature as the differences in colour between the distinct species of the same group. for when in a group in which the sexes are usually alike, the male differs considerably from the female, he is not coloured in a quite new style. hence we may infer that within the same group the special colours of both sexes when they are alike, and the colours of the male, when he differs slightly or even considerably from the female, have been in most cases determined by the same general cause; this being sexual selection. it is not probable, as has already been remarked, that differences in colour between the sexes, when very slight, can be of service to the female as a protection. assuming, however, that they are of service, they might be thought to be cases of transition; but we have no reason to believe that many species at any one time are undergoing change. therefore we can hardly admit that the numerous females which differ very slightly in colour from their males are now all commencing to become obscure for the sake of protection. even if we consider somewhat more marked sexual differences, is it probable, for instance, that the head of the female chaffinch,--the crimson on the breast of the female bullfinch,--the green of the female greenfinch,--the crest of the female golden-crested wren, have all been rendered less bright by the slow process of selection for the sake of protection? i cannot think so; and still less with the slight differences between the sexes of those birds which build concealed nests. on the other hand, the differences in colour between the sexes, whether great or small, may to a large extent be explained on the principle of the successive variations, acquired by the males through sexual selection, having been from the first more or less limited in their transmission to the females. that the degree of limitation should differ in different species of the same group will not surprise any one who has studied the laws of inheritance, for they are so complex that they appear to us in our ignorance to be capricious in their action. (28. see remarks to this effect in 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. chap. xii.) as far as i can discover there are few large groups of birds in which all the species have both sexes alike and brilliantly coloured, but i hear from mr. sclater, that this appears to be the case with the musophagae or plantain-eaters. nor do i believe that any large group exists in which the sexes of all the species are widely dissimilar in colour: mr. wallace informs me that the chatterers of s. america (cotingidae) offer one of the best instances; but with some of the species, in which the male has a splendid red breast, the female exhibits some red on her breast; and the females of other species shew traces of the green and other colours of the males. nevertheless we have a near approach to close sexual similarity or dissimilarity throughout several groups: and this, from what has just been said of the fluctuating nature of inheritance, is a somewhat surprising circumstance. but that the same laws should largely prevail with allied animals is not surprising. the domestic fowl has produced a great number of breeds and sub-breeds, and in these the sexes generally differ in plumage; so that it has been noticed as an unusual circumstance when in certain sub-breeds they resemble each other. on the other hand, the domestic pigeon has likewise produced a vast number of distinct breeds and sub-breeds, and in these, with rare exceptions, the two sexes are identically alike. therefore if other species of gallus and columba were domesticated and varied, it would not be rash to predict that similar rules of sexual similarity and dissimilarity, depending on the form of transmission, would hold good in both cases. in like manner the same form of transmission has generally prevailed under nature throughout the same groups, although marked exceptions to this rule occur. thus within the same family or even genus, the sexes may be identically alike, or very different in colour. instances have already been given in the same genus, as with sparrows, fly- catchers, thrushes and grouse. in the family of pheasants the sexes of almost all the species are wonderfully dissimilar, but are quite alike in the eared pheasant or crossoptilon auritum. in two species of chloephaga, a genus of geese, the male cannot be distinguished from the females, except by size; whilst in two others, the sexes are so unlike that they might easily be mistaken for distinct species. (29. the 'ibis,' vol. vi. 1864, p. 122.) the laws of inheritance can alone account for the following cases, in which the female acquires, late in life, certain characters proper to the male, and ultimately comes to resemble him more or less completely. here protection can hardly have come into play. mr. blyth informs me that the females of oriolus melanocephalus and of some allied species, when sufficiently mature to breed, differ considerably in plumage from the adult males; but after the second or third moults they differ only in their beaks having a slight greenish tinge. in the dwarf bitterns (ardetta), according to the same authority, "the male acquires his final livery at the first moult, the female not before the third or fourth moult; in the meanwhile she presents an intermediate garb, which is ultimately exchanged for the same livery as that of the male." so again the female falco peregrinus acquires her blue plumage more slowly than the male. mr. swinhoe states that with one of the drongo shrikes (dicrurus macrocercus) the male, whilst almost a nestling, moults his soft brown plumage and becomes of a uniform glossy greenish-black; but the female retains for a long time the white striae and spots on the axillary feathers; and does not completely assume the uniform black colour of the male for three years. the same excellent observer remarks that in the spring of the second year the female spoon- bill (platalea) of china resembles the male of the first year, and that apparently it is not until the third spring that she acquires the same adult plumage as that possessed by the male at a much earlier age. the female bombycilla carolinensis differs very little from the male, but the appendages, which like beads of red sealing-wax ornament the wing-feathers (30. when the male courts the female, these ornaments are vibrated, and "are shewn off to great advantage," on the outstretched wings: a. leith adams, 'field and forest rambles,' 1873, p. 153.), are not developed in her so early in life as in the male. in the male of an indian parrakeet (palaeornis javanicus) the upper mandible is coral-red from his earliest youth, but in the female, as mr. blyth has observed with caged and wild birds, it is at first black and does not become red until the bird is at least a year old, at which age the sexes resemble each other in all respects. both sexes of the wild turkey are ultimately furnished with a tuft of bristles on the breast, but in two-year-old birds the tuft is about four inches long in the male and hardly apparent in the female; when, however, the latter has reached her fourth year, it is from four to five inches in length. (31. on ardetta, translation of cuvier's 'regne animal,' by mr. blyth, footnote, p. 159. on the peregrine falcon, mr. blyth, in charlesworth's 'mag. of nat. hist.' vol. i. 1837, p. 304. on dicrurus, 'ibis,' 1863, p. 44. on the platalea, 'ibis,' vol. vi. 1864, p. 366. on the bombycilla, audubon's 'ornitholog. biography,' vol. i. p. 229. on the palaeornis, see, also, jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. i. p. 263. on the wild turkey, audubon, ibid. vol. i. p. 15; but i hear from judge caton that in illinois the female very rarely acquires a tuft. analogous cases with the females of petrocossyphus are given by mr. r. sharpe, 'proceedings of the zoological society,' 1872, p. 496.) these cases must not be confounded with those where diseased or old females abnormally assume masculine characters, nor with those where fertile females, whilst young, acquire the characters of the male, through variation or some unknown cause. (32. of these latter cases mr. blyth has recorded (translation of cuvier's 'regne animal,' p. 158) various instances with lanius, ruticilla, linaria, and anas. audubon has also recorded a similar case ('ornitholog. biography,' vol. v. p. 519) with pyranga aestiva.) but all these cases have so much in common that they depend, according to the hypothesis of pangenesis, on gemmules derived from each part of the male being present, though latent, in the female; their development following on some slight change in the elective affinities of her constituent tissues. a few words must be added on changes of plumage in relation to the season of the year. from reasons formerly assigned there can be little doubt that the elegant plumes, long pendant feathers, crests, etc., of egrets, herons, and many other birds, which are developed and retained only during the summer, serve for ornamental and nuptial purposes, though common to both sexes. the female is thus rendered more conspicuous during the period of incubation than during the winter; but such birds as herons and egrets would be able to defend themselves. as, however, plumes would probably be inconvenient and certainly of no use during the winter, it is possible that the habit of moulting twice in the year may have been gradually acquired through natural selection for the sake of casting off inconvenient ornaments during the winter. but this view cannot be extended to the many waders, whose summer and winter plumages differ very little in colour. with defenceless species, in which both sexes, or the males alone, become extremely conspicuous during the breeding-season,--or when the males acquire at this season such long wing or tail-feathers as to impede their flight, as with cosmetornis and vidua,--it certainly at first appears highly probable that the second moult has been gained for the special purpose of throwing off these ornaments. we must, however, remember that many birds, such as some of the birds of paradise, the argus pheasant and peacock, do not cast their plumes during the winter; and it can hardly be maintained that the constitution of these birds, at least of the gallinaceae, renders a double moult impossible, for the ptarmigan moults thrice in the year. (33. see gould's 'birds of great britain.') hence it must be considered as doubtful whether the many species which moult their ornamental plumes or lose their bright colours during the winter, have acquired this habit on account of the inconvenience or danger which they would otherwise have suffered. i conclude, therefore, that the habit of moulting twice in the year was in most or all cases first acquired for some distinct purpose, perhaps for gaining a warmer winter covering; and that variations in the plumage occurring during the summer were accumulated through sexual selection, and transmitted to the offspring at the same season of the year; that such variations were inherited either by both sexes or by the males alone, according to the form of inheritance which prevailed. this appears more probable than that the species in all cases originally tended to retain their ornamental plumage during the winter, but were saved from this through natural selection, resulting from the inconvenience or danger thus caused. i have endeavoured in this chapter to shew that the arguments are not trustworthy in favour of the view that weapons, bright colours, and various ornaments, are now confined to the males owing to the conversion, by natural selection, of the equal transmission of characters to both sexes, into transmission to the male sex alone. it is also doubtful whether the colours of many female birds are due to the preservation, for the sake of protection, of variations which were from the first limited in their transmission to the female sex. but it will be convenient to defer any further discussion on this subject until i treat, in the following chapter, of the differences in plumage between the young and old. chapter xvi. birds--concluded. the immature plumage in relation to the character of the plumage in both sexes when adult--six classes of cases--sexual differences between the males of closely-allied or representative species--the female assuming the characters of the male--plumage of the young in relation to the summer and winter plumage of the adults--on the increase of beauty in the birds of the world--protective colouring--conspicuously coloured birds--novelty appreciated--summary of the four chapters on birds. we must now consider the transmission of characters, as limited by age, in reference to sexual selection. the truth and importance of the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages need not here be discussed, as enough has already been said on the subject. before giving the several rather complex rules or classes of cases, under which the differences in plumage between the young and the old, as far as known to me, may be included, it will be well to make a few preliminary remarks. with animals of all kinds when the adults differ in colour from the young, and the colours of the latter are not, as far as we can see, of any special service, they may generally be attributed, like various embryological structures, to the retention of a former character. but this view can be maintained with confidence, only when the young of several species resemble each other closely, and likewise resemble other adult species belonging to the same group; for the latter are the living proofs that such a state of things was formerly possible. young lions and pumas are marked with feeble stripes or rows of spots, and as many allied species both young and old are similarly marked, no believer in evolution will doubt that the progenitor of the lion and puma was a striped animal, and that the young have retained vestiges of the stripes, like the kittens of black cats, which are not in the least striped when grown up. many species of deer, which when mature are not spotted, are whilst young covered with white spots, as are likewise some few species in the adult state. so again the young in the whole family of pigs (suidae), and in certain rather distantly allied animals, such as the tapir, are marked with dark longitudinal stripes; but here we have a character apparently derived from an extinct progenitor, and now preserved by the young alone. in all such cases the old have had their colours changed in the course of time, whilst the young have remained but little altered, and this has been effected through the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages. this same principle applies to many birds belonging to various groups, in which the young closely resemble each other, and differ much from their respective adult parents. the young of almost all the gallinaceae, and of some distantly allied birds such as ostriches, are covered with longitudinally striped down; but this character points back to a state of things so remote that it hardly concerns us. young cross-bills (loxia) have at first straight beaks like those of other finches, and in their immature striated plumage they resemble the mature red-pole and female siskin, as well as the young of the goldfinch, greenfinch, and some other allied species. the young of many kinds of buntings (emberiza) resemble one another, and likewise the adult state of the common bunting, e. miliaria. in almost the whole large group of thrushes the young have their breasts spotted--a character which is retained throughout life by many species, but is quite lost by others, as by the turdus migratorius. so again with many thrushes, the feathers on the back are mottled before they are moulted for the first time, and this character is retained for life by certain eastern species. the young of many species of shrikes (lanius), of some woodpeckers, and of an indian pigeon (chalcophaps indicus), are transversely striped on the under surface; and certain allied species or whole genera are similarly marked when adult. in some closely-allied and resplendent indian cuckoos (chrysococcyx), the mature species differ considerably from one another in colour, but the young cannot be distinguished. the young of an indian goose (sarkidiornis melanonotus) closely resemble in plumage an allied genus, dendrocygna, when mature. (1. in regard to thrushes, shrikes, and woodpeckers, see mr. blyth, in charlesworth's 'mag. of nat. hist.' vol. i. 1837, p. 304; also footnote to his translation of cuvier's 'regne animal,' p. 159. i give the case of loxia on mr. blyth's information. on thrushes, see also audubon, 'ornith. biog.' vol. ii. p. 195. on chrysococcyx and chalcophaps, blyth, as quoted in jerdon's 'birds of india,' vol. iii. p. 485. on sarkidiornis, blyth, in 'ibis,' 1867, p. 175.) similar facts will hereafter be given in regard to certain herons. young black-grouse (tetrao tetrix) resemble the young as well as the old of certain other species, for instance the red-grouse or t. scoticus. finally, as mr. blyth, who has attended closely to this subject, has well remarked, the natural affinities of many species are best exhibited in their immature plumage; and as the true affinities of all organic beings depend on their descent from a common progenitor, this remark strongly confirms the belief that the immature plumage approximately shews us the former or ancestral condition of the species. although many young birds, belonging to various families, thus give us a glimpse of the plumage of their remote progenitors, yet there are many other birds, both dull-coloured and bright-coloured, in which the young closely resemble their parents. in such cases the young of the different species cannot resemble each other more closely than do the parents; nor can they strikingly resemble allied forms when adult. they give us but little insight into the plumage of their progenitors, excepting in so far that, when the young and the old are coloured in the same general manner throughout a whole group of species, it is probable that their progenitors were similarly coloured. we may now consider the classes of cases, under which the differences and resemblances between the plumage of the young and the old, in both sexes or in one sex alone, may be grouped. rules of this kind were first enounced by cuvier; but with the progress of knowledge they require some modification and amplification. this i have attempted to do, as far as the extreme complexity of the subject permits, from information derived from various sources; but a full essay on this subject by some competent ornithologist is much needed. in order to ascertain to what extent each rule prevails, i have tabulated the facts given in four great works, namely, by macgillivray on the birds of britain, audubon on those of north america, jerdon on those of india, and gould on those of australia. i may here premise, first, that the several cases or rules graduate into each other; and secondly, that when the young are said to resemble their parents, it is not meant that they are identically alike, for their colours are almost always less vivid, and the feathers are softer and often of a different shape. rules or classes of cases. i. when the adult male is more beautiful or conspicuous than the adult female, the young of both sexes in their first plumage closely resemble the adult female, as with the common fowl and peacock; or, as occasionally occurs, they resemble her much more closely than they do the adult male. ii. when the adult female is more conspicuous than the adult male, as sometimes though rarely occurs, the young of both sexes in their first plumage resemble the adult male. iii. when the adult male resembles the adult female, the young of both sexes have a peculiar first plumage of their own, as with the robin. iv. when the adult male resembles the adult female, the young of both sexes in their first plumage resemble the adults, as with the kingfisher, many parrots, crows, hedge-warblers. v. when the adults of both sexes have a distinct winter and summer plumage, whether or not the male differs from the female, the young resemble the adults of both sexes in their winter dress, or much more rarely in their summer dress, or they resemble the females alone. or the young may have an intermediate character; or again they may differ greatly from the adults in both their seasonal plumages. vi. in some few cases the young in their first plumage differ from each other according to sex; the young males resembling more or less closely the adult males, and the young females more or less closely the adult females. class i. in this class, the young of both sexes more or less closely resemble the adult female, whilst the adult male differs from the adult female, often in the most conspicuous manner. innumerable instances in all orders could be given; it will suffice to call to mind the common pheasant, duck, and house-sparrow. the cases under this class graduate into others. thus the two sexes when adult may differ so slightly, and the young so slightly from the adults, that it is doubtful whether such cases ought to come under the present, or under the third or fourth classes. so again the young of the two sexes, instead of being quite alike, may differ in a slight degree from each other, as in our sixth class. these transitional cases, however, are few, or at least are not strongly pronounced, in comparison with those which come strictly under the present class. the force of the present law is well shewn in those groups, in which, as a general rule, the two sexes and the young are all alike; for when in these groups the male does differ from the female, as with certain parrots, kingfishers, pigeons, etc., the young of both sexes resemble the adult female. (2. see, for instance, mr. gould's account ('handbook to the birds of australia,' vol. i. p. 133) of cyanalcyon (one of the kingfishers), in which, however, the young male, though resembling the adult female, is less brilliantly coloured. in some species of dacelo the males have blue tails, and the females brown ones; and mr. r.b. sharpe informs me that the tail of the young male of d. gaudichaudi is at first brown. mr. gould has described (ibid. vol. ii. pp. 14, 20, 37) the sexes and the young of certain black cockatoos and of the king lory, with which the same rule prevails. also jerdon ('birds of india,' vol. i. p. 260) on the palaeornis rosa, in which the young are more like the female than the male. see audubon ('ornithological biography,' vol. ii. p. 475) on the two sexes and the young of columba passerina.) we see the same fact exhibited still more clearly in certain anomalous cases; thus the male of heliothrix auriculata (one of the humming-birds) differs conspicuously from the female in having a splendid gorget and fine ear-tufts, but the female is remarkable from having a much longer tail than that of the male; now the young of both sexes resemble (with the exception of the breast being spotted with bronze) the adult female in all other respects, including the length of her tail, so that the tail of the male actually becomes shorter as he reaches maturity, which is a most unusual circumstance. (3. i owe this information to mr. gould, who shewed me the specimens; see also his 'introduction to the trochilidae,' 1861, p. 120.) again, the plumage of the male goosander (mergus merganser) is more conspicuously coloured than that of the female, with the scapular and secondary wing-feathers much longer; but differently from what occurs, as far as i know, in any other bird, the crest of the adult male, though broader than that of the female, is considerably shorter, being only a little above an inch in length; the crest of the female being two and a half inches long. now the young of both sexes entirely resemble the adult female, so that their crests are actually of greater length, though narrower, than in the adult male. (4. macgillivray, 'hist. brit. birds,' vol. v. pp. 207-214.) when the young and the females closely resemble each other and both differ from the males, the most obvious conclusion is that the males alone have been modified. even in the anomalous cases of the heliothrix and mergus, it is probable that originally both adult sexes were furnished--the one species with a much elongated tail, and the other with a much elongated crest--these characters having since been partially lost by the adult males from some unexplained cause, and transmitted in their diminished state to their male offspring alone, when arrived at the corresponding age of maturity. the belief that in the present class the male alone has been modified, as far as the differences between the male and the female together with her young are concerned, is strongly supported by some remarkable facts recorded by mr. blyth (5. see his admirable paper in the 'journal of the asiatic soc. of bengal,' vol. xix. 1850, p. 223; see also jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. i. introduction, p. xxix. in regard to tanysiptera, prof. schlegel told mr. blyth that he could distinguish several distinct races, solely by comparing the adult males.), with respect to closely-allied species which represent each other in distinct countries. for with several of these representative species the adult males have undergone a certain amount of change and can be distinguished; the females and the young from the distinct countries being indistinguishable, and therefore absolutely unchanged. this is the case with certain indian chats (thamnobia), with certain honey-suckers (nectarinia), shrikes (tephrodornis), certain kingfishers (tanysiptera), kalij pheasants (gallophasis), and tree-partridges (arboricola). in some analogous cases, namely with birds having a different summer and winter plumage, but with the two sexes nearly alike, certain closely-allied species can easily be distinguished in their summer or nuptial plumage, yet are indistinguishable in their winter as well as in their immature plumage. this is the case with some of the closely-allied indian wagtails or motacillae. mr. swinhoe (6. see also mr. swinhoe, in 'ibis,' july 1863, p. 131; and a previous paper, with an extract from a note by mr. blyth, in 'ibis,' january, 1861, p. 25.) informs me that three species of ardeola, a genus of herons, which represent one another on separate continents, are "most strikingly different" when ornamented with their summer plumes, but are hardly, if at all, distinguishable during the winter. the young also of these three species in their immature plumage closely resemble the adults in their winter dress. this case is all the more interesting, because with two other species of ardeola both sexes retain, during the winter and summer, nearly the same plumage as that possessed by the three first species during the winter and in their immature state; and this plumage, which is common to several distinct species at different ages and seasons, probably shews us how the progenitors of the genus were coloured. in all these cases, the nuptial plumage which we may assume was originally acquired by the adult males during the breeding-season, and transmitted to the adults of both sexes at the corresponding season, has been modified, whilst the winter and immature plumages have been left unchanged. the question naturally arises, how is it that in these latter cases the winter plumage of both sexes, and in the former cases the plumage of the adult females, as well as the immature plumage of the young, have not been at all affected? the species which represent each other in distinct countries will almost always have been exposed to somewhat different conditions, but we can hardly attribute to this action the modification of the plumage in the males alone, seeing that the females and the young, though similarly exposed, have not been affected. hardly any fact shews us more clearly how subordinate in importance is the direct action of the conditions of life, in comparison with the accumulation through selection of indefinite variations, than the surprising difference between the sexes of many birds; for both will have consumed the same food, and have been exposed to the same climate. nevertheless we are not precluded from believing that in the course of time new conditions may produce some direct effect either on both sexes, or from their constitutional differences chiefly on one sex. we see only that this is subordinate in importance to the accumulated results of selection. judging, however, from a wide-spread analogy, when a species migrates into a new country (and this must precede the formation of representative species), the changed conditions to which they will almost always have been exposed will cause them to undergo a certain amount of fluctuating variability. in this case sexual selection, which depends on an element liable to change--the taste or admiration of the female--will have had new shades of colour or other differences to act on and accumulate; and as sexual selection is always at work, it would (from what we know of the results on domestic animals of man's unintentional selection), be surprising if animals inhabiting separate districts, which can never cross and thus blend their newly-acquired characters, were not, after a sufficient lapse of time, differently modified. these remarks likewise apply to the nuptial or summer plumage, whether confined to the males, or common to both sexes. although the females of the above closely-allied or representative species, together with their young, differ hardly at all from one another, so that the males alone can be distinguished, yet the females of most species within the same genus obviously differ from each other. the differences, however, are rarely as great as between the males. we see this clearly in the whole family of the gallinaceae: the females, for instance, of the common and japan pheasant, and especially of the gold and amherst pheasant --of the silver pheasant and the wild fowl--resemble one another very closely in colour, whilst the males differ to an extraordinary degree. so it is with the females of most of the cotingidae, fringillidae, and many other families. there can indeed be no doubt that, as a general rule, the females have been less modified than the males. some few birds, however, offer a singular and inexplicable exception; thus the females of paradisea apoda and p. papuana differ from each other more than do their respective males (7. wallace, 'the malay archipelago,' vol. ii. 1869, p. 394.); the female of the latter species having the under surface pure white, whilst the female p. apoda is deep brown beneath. so, again, as i hear from professor newton, the males of two species of oxynotus (shrikes), which represent each other in the islands of mauritius and bourbon (8. these species are described with coloured figures, by m. f. pollen, in 'ibis,' 1866, p. 275.), differ but little in colour, whilst the females differ much. in the bourbon species the female appears to have partially retained an immature condition of plumage, for at first sight she "might be taken for the young of the mauritian species." these differences may be compared with those inexplicable ones, which occur independently of man's selection in certain sub-breeds of the game-fowl, in which the females are very different, whilst the males can hardly be distinguished. (9. 'variation of animals,' etc., vol. i. p. 251.) as i account so largely by sexual selection for the differences between the males of allied species, how can the differences between the females be accounted for in all ordinary cases? we need not here consider the species which belong to distinct genera; for with these, adaptation to different habits of life, and other agencies, will have come into play. in regard to the differences between the females within the same genus, it appears to me almost certain, after looking through various large groups, that the chief agent has been the greater or less transference to the female of the characters acquired by the males through sexual selection. in the several british finches, the two sexes differ either very slightly or considerably; and if we compare the females of the greenfinch, chaffinch, goldfinch, bullfinch, crossbill, sparrow, etc., we shall see that they differ from one another chiefly in the points in which they partially resemble their respective males; and the colours of the males may safely be attributed to sexual selection. with many gallinaceous species the sexes differ to an extreme degree, as with the peacock, pheasant, and fowl, whilst with other species there has been a partial or even complete transference of character from the male to the female. the females of the several species of polyplectron exhibit in a dim condition, and chiefly on the tail, the splendid ocelli of their males. the female partridge differs from the male only in the red mark on her breast being smaller; and the female wild turkey only in her colours being much duller. in the guinea-fowl the two sexes are indistinguishable. there is no improbability in the plain, though peculiarly spotted plumage of this latter bird having been acquired through sexual selection by the males, and then transmitted to both sexes; for it is not essentially different from the much more beautifully spotted plumage, characteristic of the males alone of the tragopan pheasants. it should be observed that, in some instances, the transference of characters from the male to the female has been effected apparently at a remote period, the male having subsequently undergone great changes, without transferring to the female any of his later-gained characters. for instance, the female and the young of the black-grouse (tetrao tetrix) resemble pretty closely both sexes and the young of the red-grouse (t. scoticus); and we may consequently infer that the black-grouse is descended from some ancient species, of which both sexes were coloured in nearly the same manner as the red-grouse. as both sexes of this latter species are more distinctly barred during the breeding-season than at any other time, and as the male differs slightly from the female in his more strongly- pronounced red and brown tints (10. macgillivray, 'history of british birds,' vol. i. pp. 172-174.), we may conclude that his plumage has been influenced by sexual selection, at least to a certain extent. if so, we may further infer that nearly similar plumage of the female black-grouse was similarly produced at some former period. but since this period the male black-grouse has acquired his fine black plumage, with his forked and outwardly-curled tail-feathers; but of these characters there has hardly been any transference to the female, excepting that she shews in her tail a trace of the curved fork. we may therefore conclude that the females of distinct though allied species have often had their plumage rendered more or less different by the transference in various degrees of characters acquired by the males through sexual selection, both during former and recent times. but it deserves especial attention that brilliant colours have been transferred much more rarely than other tints. for instance, the male of the red-throated blue- breast (cyanecula suecica) has a rich blue breast, including a sub- triangular red mark; now marks of nearly the same shape have been transferred to the female, but the central space is fulvous instead of red, and is surrounded by mottled instead of blue feathers. the gallinaceae offer many analogous cases; for none of the species, such as partridges, quails, guinea-fowls, etc., in which the colours of the plumage have been largely transferred from the male to the female, are brilliantly coloured. this is well exemplified with the pheasants, in which the male is generally so much more brilliant than the female; but with the eared and cheer pheasants (crossoptilon auritum and phasianus wallichii) the sexes closely resemble each other and their colours are dull. we may go so far as to believe that if any part of the plumage in the males of these two pheasants had been brilliantly coloured, it would not have been transferred to the females. these facts strongly support mr. wallace's view that with birds which are exposed to much danger during incubation, the transference of bright colours from the male to the female has been checked through natural selection. we must not, however, forget that another explanation, before given, is possible; namely, that the males which varied and became bright, whilst they were young and inexperienced, would have been exposed to much danger, and would generally have been destroyed; the older and more cautious males, on the other hand, if they varied in a like manner, would not only have been able to survive, but would have been favoured in their rivalry with other males. now variations occurring late in life tend to be transmitted exclusively to the same sex, so that in this case extremely bright tints would not have been transmitted to the females. on the other hand, ornaments of a less conspicuous kind, such as those possessed by the eared and cheer pheasants, would not have been dangerous, and if they appeared during early youth, would generally have been transmitted to both sexes. in addition to the effects of the partial transference of characters from the males to the females, some of the differences between the females of closely allied species may be attributed to the direct or definite action of the conditions of life. (11. see, on this subject, chap. xxiii. in the 'variation of animals and plants under domestication.') with the males, any such action would generally have been masked by the brilliant colours gained through sexual selection; but not so with the females. each of the endless diversities in plumage which we see in our domesticated birds is, of course, the result of some definite cause; and under natural and more uniform conditions, some one tint, assuming that it was in no way injurious, would almost certainly sooner or later prevail. the free intercrossing of the many individuals belonging to the same species would ultimately tend to make any change of colour, thus induced, uniform in character. no one doubts that both sexes of many birds have had their colours adapted for the sake of protection; and it is possible that the females alone of some species may have been modified for this end. although it would be a difficult, perhaps an impossible process, as shewn in the last chapter, to convert one form of transmission into another through selection, there would not be the least difficulty in adapting the colours of the female, independently of those of the male, to surrounding objects, through the accumulation of variations which were from the first limited in their transmission to the female sex. if the variations were not thus limited, the bright tints of the male would be deteriorated or destroyed. whether the females alone of many species have been thus specially modified, is at present very doubtful. i wish i could follow mr. wallace to the full extent; for the admission would remove some difficulties. any variations which were of no service to the female as a protection would be at once obliterated, instead of being lost simply by not being selected, or from free intercrossing, or from being eliminated when transferred to the male and in any way injurious to him. thus the plumage of the female would be kept constant in character. it would also be a relief if we could admit that the obscure tints of both sexes of many birds had been acquired and preserved for the sake of protection,--for example, of the hedge-warbler or kitty-wren (accentor modularis and troglodytes vulgaris), with respect to which we have no sufficient evidence of the action of sexual selection. we ought, however, to be cautious in concluding that colours which appear to us dull, are not attractive to the females of certain species; we should bear in mind such cases as that of the common house-sparrow, in which the male differs much from the female, but does not exhibit any bright tints. no one probably will dispute that many gallinaceous birds which live on the open ground, have acquired their present colours, at least in part, for the sake of protection. we know how well they are thus concealed; we know that ptarmigans, whilst changing from their winter to their summer plumage, both of which are protective, suffer greatly from birds of prey. but can we believe that the very slight differences in tints and markings between, for instance, the female black-grouse and red-grouse serve as a protection? are partridges, as they are now coloured, better protected than if they had resembled quails? do the slight differences between the females of the common pheasant, the japan and gold pheasants, serve as a protection, or might not their plumages have been interchanged with impunity? from what mr. wallace has observed of the habits of certain gallinaceous birds in the east, he thinks that such slight differences are beneficial. for myself, i will only say that i am not convinced. formerly when i was inclined to lay much stress on protection as accounting for the duller colours of female birds, it occurred to me that possibly both sexes and the young might aboriginally have been equally bright coloured; but that subsequently, the females from the danger incurred during incubation, and the young from being inexperienced, had been rendered dull as a protection. but this view is not supported by any evidence, and is not probable; for we thus in imagination expose during past times the females and the young to danger, from which it has subsequently been necessary to shield their modified descendants. we have, also, to reduce, through a gradual process of selection, the females and the young to almost exactly the same tints and markings, and to transmit them to the corresponding sex and period of life. on the supposition that the females and the young have partaken during each stage of the process of modification of a tendency to be as brightly coloured as the males, it is also a somewhat strange fact that the females have never been rendered dull-coloured without the young participating in the same change; for there are no instances, as far as i can discover, of species with the females dull and the young bright coloured. a partial exception, however, is offered by the young of certain woodpeckers, for they have "the whole upper part of the head tinged with red," which afterwards either decreases into a mere circular red line in the adults of both sexes, or quite disappears in the adult females. (12. audubon, 'ornith. biography,' vol. i. p. 193. macgillivray, 'history of british birds,' vol. iii. p. 85. see also the case before given of indopicus carlotta.) finally, with respect to our present class of cases, the most probable view appears to be that successive variations in brightness or in other ornamental characters, occurring in the males at a rather late period of life have alone been preserved; and that most or all of these variations, owing to the late period of life at which they appeared, have been from the first transmitted only to the adult male offspring. any variations in brightness occurring in the females or in the young, would have been of no service to them, and would not have been selected; and moreover, if dangerous, would have been eliminated. thus the females and the young will either have been left unmodified, or (as is much more common) will have been partially modified by receiving through transference from the males some of his successive variations. both sexes have perhaps been directly acted on by the conditions of life to which they have long been exposed: but the females from not being otherwise much modified, will best exhibit any such effects. these changes and all others will have been kept uniform by the free intercrossing of many individuals. in some cases, especially with ground birds, the females and the young may possibly have been modified, independently of the males, for the sake of protection, so as to have acquired the same dull-coloured plumage. class ii. when the adult female is more conspicuous than the adult male, the young of both sexes in their first plumage resemble the adult male. this class is exactly the reverse of the last, for the females are here brighter coloured or more conspicuous than the males; and the young, as far as they are known, resemble the adult males instead of the adult females. but the difference between the sexes is never nearly so great as with many birds in the first class, and the cases are comparatively rare. mr. wallace, who first called attention to the singular relation which exists between the less bright colours of the males and their performing the duties of incubation, lays great stress on this point (13. 'westminster review,' july 1867, and a. murray, 'journal of travel,' 1868, p. 83.), as a crucial test that obscure colours have been acquired for the sake of protection during the period of nesting. a different view seems to me more probable. as the cases are curious and not numerous, i will briefly give all that i have been able to find. in one section of the genus turnix, quail-like birds, the female is invariably larger than the male (being nearly twice as large in one of the australian species), and this is an unusual circumstance with the gallinaceae. in most of the species the female is more distinctly coloured and brighter than the male (14. for the australian species, see gould's 'handbook,' etc., vol. ii. pp. 178, 180, 186, and 188. in the british museum specimens of the australian plain-wanderer (pedionomus torquatus) may be seen, shewing similar sexual differences.), but in some few species the sexes are alike. in turnix taigoor of india the male "wants the black on the throat and neck, and the whole tone of the plumage is lighter and less pronounced than that of the female." the female appears to be noisier, and is certainly much more pugnacious than the male; so that the females and not the males are often kept by the natives for fighting, like game-cocks. as male birds are exposed by the english bird-catchers for a decoy near a trap, in order to catch other males by exciting their rivalry, so the females of this turnix are employed in india. when thus exposed the females soon begin their "loud purring call, which can be heard a long way off, and any females within ear-shot run rapidly to the spot, and commence fighting with the caged bird." in this way from twelve to twenty birds, all breeding females, may be caught in the course of a single day. the natives assert that the females after laying their eggs associate in flocks, and leave the males to sit on them. there is no reason to doubt the truth of this assertion, which is supported by some observations made in china by mr. swinhoe. (15. jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. iii. p. 596. mr. swinhoe, in 'ibis,' 1865, p. 542; 1866, pp. 131, 405.) mr. blyth believes, that the young of both sexes resemble the adult male. [fig. 62. rhynchaea capensis (from brehm).] the females of the three species of painted snipes (rhynchaea, fig. 62) "are not only larger but much more richly coloured than the males." (16. jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. iii. p. 677.) with all other birds in which the trachea differs in structure in the two sexes it is more developed and complex in the male than in the female; but in the rhynchaea australis it is simple in the male, whilst in the female it makes four distinct convolutions before entering the lungs. (17. gould's 'handbook to the birds of australia,' vol. ii. p. 275.) the female therefore of this species has acquired an eminently masculine character. mr. blyth ascertained, by examining many specimens, that the trachea is not convoluted in either sex of r. bengalensis, which species resembles r. australis so closely, that it can hardly be distinguished except by its shorter toes. this fact is another striking instance of the law that secondary sexual characters are often widely different in closely-allied forms, though it is a very rare circumstance when such differences relate to the female sex. the young of both sexes of r. bengalensis in their first plumage are said to resemble the mature male. (18. 'the indian field,' sept. 1858, p. 3.) there is also reason to believe that the male undertakes the duty of incubation, for mr. swinhoe (19. 'ibis,' 1866, p. 298.) found the females before the close of the summer associated in flocks, as occurs with the females of the turnix. the females of phalaropus fulicarius and p. hyperboreus are larger, and in their summer plumage "more gaily attired than the males." but the difference in colour between the sexes is far from conspicuous. according to professor steenstrup, the male alone of p. fulicarius undertakes the duty of incubation; this is likewise shewn by the state of his breast- feathers during the breeding-season. the female of the dotterel plover (eudromias morinellus) is larger than the male, and has the red and black tints on the lower surface, the white crescent on the breast, and the stripes over the eyes, more strongly pronounced. the male also takes at least a share in hatching the eggs; but the female likewise attends to the young. (20. for these several statements, see mr. gould's 'birds of great britain.' prof. newton informs me that he has long been convinced, from his own observations and from those of others, that the males of the above- named species take either the whole or a large share of the duties of incubation, and that they "shew much greater devotion towards their young, when in danger, than do the females." so it is, as he informs me, with limosa lapponica and some few other waders, in which the females are larger and have more strongly contrasted colours than the males.) i have not been able to discover whether with these species the young resemble the adult males more closely than the adult females; for the comparison is somewhat difficult to make on account of the double moult. turning now to the ostrich order: the male of the common cassowary (casuarius galeatus) would be thought by any one to be the female, from his smaller size and from the appendages and naked skin about his head being much less brightly coloured; and i am informed by mr. bartlett that in the zoological gardens, it is certainly the male alone who sits on the eggs and takes care of the young. (21. the natives of ceram (wallace, 'malay archipelago,' vol. ii. p. 150) assert that the male and female sit alternately on the eggs; but this assertion, as mr. bartlett thinks, may be accounted for by the female visiting the nest to lay her eggs.) the female is said by mr. t.w. wood (22. the 'student,' april 1870, p. 124.) to exhibit during the breeding-season a most pugnacious disposition; and her wattles then become enlarged and more brilliantly coloured. so again the female of one of the emus (dromoeus irroratus) is considerably larger than the male, and she possesses a slight top-knot, but is otherwise indistinguishable in plumage. she appears, however, "to have greater power, when angry or otherwise excited, of erecting, like a turkey-cock, the feathers of her neck and breast. she is usually the more courageous and pugilistic. she makes a deep hollow guttural boom especially at night, sounding like a small gong. the male has a slenderer frame and is more docile, with no voice beyond a suppressed hiss when angry, or a croak." he not only performs the whole duty of incubation, but has to defend the young from their mother; "for as soon as she catches sight of her progeny she becomes violently agitated, and notwithstanding the resistance of the father appears to use her utmost endeavours to destroy them. for months afterwards it is unsafe to put the parents together, violent quarrels being the inevitable result, in which the female generally comes off conqueror." (23. see the excellent account of the habits of this bird under confinement, by mr. a.w. bennett, in 'land and water,' may 1868, p. 233.) so that with this emu we have a complete reversal not only of the parental and incubating instincts, but of the usual moral qualities of the two sexes; the females being savage, quarrelsome, and noisy, the males gentle and good. the case is very different with the african ostrich, for the male is somewhat larger than the female and has finer plumes with more strongly contrasted colours; nevertheless he undertakes the whole duty of incubation. (24. mr. sclater, on the incubation of the struthiones, 'proc. zool. soc.' june 9, 1863. so it is with the rhea darwinii: captain musters says ('at home with the patagonians,' 1871, p. 128), that the male is larger, stronger and swifter than the female, and of slightly darker colours; yet he takes sole charge of the eggs and of the young, just as does the male of the common species of rhea.) i will specify the few other cases known to me, in which the female is more conspicuously coloured than the male, although nothing is known about the manner of incubation. with the carrion-hawk of the falkland islands (milvago leucurus) i was much surprised to find by dissection that the individuals, which had all their tints strongly pronounced, with the cere and legs orange-coloured, were the adult females; whilst those with duller plumage and grey legs were the males or the young. in an australian tree- creeper (climacteris erythrops) the female differs from the male in "being adorned with beautiful, radiated, rufous markings on the throat, the male having this part quite plain." lastly, in an australian night-jar "the female always exceeds the male in size and in the brilliance of her tints; the males, on the other hand, have two white spots on the primaries more conspicuous than in the female." (25. for the milvago, see 'zoology of the voyage of the "beagle," birds,' 1841, p. 16. for the climacteris and night-jar (eurostopodus), see gould's 'handbook to the birds of australia,' vol. i. pp. 602 and 97. the new zealand shieldrake (tadorna variegata) offers a quite anomalous case; the head of the female is pure white, and her back is redder than that of the male; the head of the male is of a rich dark bronzed colour, and his back is clothed with finely pencilled slate- coloured feathers, so that altogether he may be considered as the more beautiful of the two. he is larger and more pugnacious than the female, and does not sit on the eggs. so that in all these respects this species comes under our first class of cases; but mr. sclater ('proceedings of the zoological society,' 1866, p. 150) was much surprised to observe that the young of both sexes, when about three months old, resembled in their dark heads and necks the adult males, instead of the adult females; so that it would appear in this case that the females have been modified, whilst the males and the young have retained a former state of plumage.) we thus see that the cases in which female birds are more conspicuously coloured than the males, with the young in their immature plumage resembling the adult males instead of the adult females, as in the previous class, are not numerous, though they are distributed in various orders. the amount of difference, also, between the sexes is incomparably less than that which frequently occurs in the last class; so that the cause of the difference, whatever it may have been, has here acted on the females either less energetically or less persistently than on the males in the last class. mr. wallace believes that the males have had their colours rendered less conspicuous for the sake of protection during the period of incubation; but the difference between the sexes in hardly any of the foregoing cases appears sufficiently great for this view to be safely accepted. in some of the cases, the brighter tints of the female are almost confined to the lower surface, and the males, if thus coloured, would not have been exposed to danger whilst sitting on the eggs. it should also be borne in mind that the males are not only in a slight degree less conspicuously coloured than the females, but are smaller and weaker. they have, moreover, not only acquired the maternal instinct of incubation, but are less pugnacious and vociferous than the females, and in one instance have simpler vocal organs. thus an almost complete transposition of the instincts, habits, disposition, colour, size, and of some points of structure, has been effected between the two sexes. now if we might assume that the males in the present class have lost some of that ardour which is usual to their sex, so that they no longer search eagerly for the females; or, if we might assume that the females have become much more numerous than the males--and in the case of one indian turnix the females are said to be "much more commonly met with than the males" (26. jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. iii. p. 598.)--then it is not improbable that the females would have been led to court the males, instead of being courted by them. this indeed is the case to a certain extent with some birds, as we have seen with the peahen, wild turkey, and certain kinds of grouse. taking as our guide the habits of most male birds, the greater size and strength as well as the extraordinary pugnacity of the females of the turnix and emu, must mean that they endeavour to drive away rival females, in order to gain possession of the male; and on this view all the facts become clear; for the males would probably be most charmed or excited by the females which were the most attractive to them by their bright colours, other ornaments, or vocal powers. sexual selection would then do its work, steadily adding to the attractions of the females; the males and the young being left not at all, or but little modified. class iii. when the adult male resembles the adult female, the young of both sexes have a peculiar first plumage of their own. in this class the sexes when adult resemble each other, and differ from the young. this occurs with many birds of many kinds. the male robin can hardly be distinguished from the female, but the young are widely different, with their mottled dusky-olive and brown plumage. the male and female of the splendid scarlet ibis are alike, whilst the young are brown; and the scarlet colour, though common to both sexes, is apparently a sexual character, for it is not well developed in either sex under confinement; and a loss of colour often occurs with brilliant males when they are confined. with many species of herons the young differ greatly from the adults; and the summer plumage of the latter, though common to both sexes, clearly has a nuptial character. young swans are slate-coloured, whilst the mature birds are pure white; but it would be superfluous to give additional instances. these differences between the young and the old apparently depend, as in the last two classes, on the young having retained a former or ancient state of plumage, whilst the old of both sexes have acquired a new one. when the adults are bright coloured, we may conclude from the remarks just made in relation to the scarlet ibis and to many herons, and from the analogy of the species in the first class, that such colours have been acquired through sexual selection by the nearly mature males; but that, differently from what occurs in the first two classes, the transmission, though limited to the same age, has not been limited to the same sex. consequently, the sexes when mature resemble each other and differ from the young. class iv. when the adult male resembles the adult female, the young of both sexes in their first plumage resemble the adults. in this class the young and the adults of both sexes, whether brilliantly or obscurely coloured, resemble each other. such cases are, i think, more common than those in the last class. we have in england instances in the kingfisher, some woodpeckers, the jay, magpie, crow, and many small dull- coloured birds, such as the hedge-warbler or kitty-wren. but the similarity in plumage between the young and the old is never complete, and graduates away into dissimilarity. thus the young of some members of the kingfisher family are not only less vividly coloured than the adults, but many of the feathers on the lower surface are edged with brown (27. jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. i. pp. 222, 228. gould's 'handbook to the birds of australia,' vol. i. pp. 124, 130.),--a vestige probably of a former state of the plumage. frequently in the same group of birds, even within the same genus, for instance in an australian genus of parrakeets (platycercus), the young of some species closely resemble, whilst the young of other species differ considerably, from their parents of both sexes, which are alike. (28. gould, ibid. vol. ii. pp. 37, 46, 56.) both sexes and the young of the common jay are closely similar; but in the canada jay (perisoreus canadensis) the young differ so much from their parents that they were formerly described as distinct species. (29. audubon, 'ornith. biography,' vol. ii. p. 55.) i may remark before proceeding that, under the present and next two classes of cases, the facts are so complex and the conclusions so doubtful, that any one who feels no especial interest in the subject had better pass them over. the brilliant or conspicuous colours which characterise many birds in the present class, can rarely or never be of service to them as a protection; so that they have probably been gained by the males through sexual selection, and then transferred to the females and the young. it is, however, possible that the males may have selected the more attractive females; and if these transmitted their characters to their offspring of both sexes, the same results would follow as from the selection of the more attractive males by the females. but there is evidence that this contingency has rarely, if ever, occurred in any of those groups of birds in which the sexes are generally alike; for, if even a few of the successive variations had failed to be transmitted to both sexes, the females would have slightly exceeded the males in beauty. exactly the reverse occurs under nature; for, in almost every large group in which the sexes generally resemble each other, the males of some few species are in a slight degree more brightly coloured than the females. it is again possible that the females may have selected the more beautiful males, these males having reciprocally selected the more beautiful females; but it is doubtful whether this double process of selection would be likely to occur, owing to the greater eagerness of one sex than the other, and whether it would be more efficient than selection on one side alone. it is, therefore, the most probable view that sexual selection has acted, in the present class, as far as ornamental characters are concerned, in accordance with the general rule throughout the animal kingdom, that is, on the males; and that these have transmitted their gradually-acquired colours, either equally or almost equally, to their offspring of both sexes. another point is more doubtful, namely, whether the successive variations first appeared in the males after they had become nearly mature, or whilst quite young. in either case sexual selection must have acted on the male when he had to compete with rivals for the possession of the female; and in both cases the characters thus acquired have been transmitted to both sexes and all ages. but these characters if acquired by the males when adult, may have been transmitted at first to the adults alone, and at some subsequent period transferred to the young. for it is known that, when the law of inheritance at corresponding ages fails, the offspring often inherit characters at an earlier age than that at which they first appeared in their parents. (30. 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. p. 79.) cases apparently of this kind have been observed with birds in a state of nature. for instance mr. blyth has seen specimens of lanius rufus and of colymbus glacialis which had assumed whilst young, in a quite anomalous manner, the adult plumage of their parents. (31. 'charlesworth's magazine of natural history,' vol. i. 1837, pp. 305, 306.) again, the young of the common swan (cygnus olor) do not cast off their dark feathers and become white until eighteen months or two years old; but dr. f. forel has described the case of three vigorous young birds, out of a brood of four, which were born pure white. these young birds were not albinos, as shewn by the colour of their beaks and legs, which nearly resembled the same parts in the adults. (32. 'bulletin de la soc. vaudoise des sc. nat.' vol. x. 1869, p. 132. the young of the polish swan, cygnus immutabilis of yarrell, are always white; but this species, as mr. sclater informs me, is believed to be nothing more than a variety of the domestic swan (cygnus olor).) it may be worth while to illustrate the above three modes by which, in the present class, the two sexes and the young may have come to resemble each other, by the curious case of the genus passer. (33. i am indebted to mr. blyth for information in regard to this genus. the sparrow of palestine belongs to the sub-genus petronia.) in the house-sparrow (p. domesticus) the male differs much from the female and from the young. the young and the females are alike, and resemble to a large extent both sexes and the young of the sparrow of palestine (p. brachydactylus), as well as of some allied species. we may therefore assume that the female and young of the house-sparrow approximately shew us the plumage of the progenitor of the genus. now with the tree-sparrow (p. montanus) both sexes and the young closely resemble the male of the house-sparrow; so that they have all been modified in the same manner, and all depart from the typical colouring of their early progenitor. this may have been effected by a male ancestor of the tree-sparrow having varied, firstly, when nearly mature; or, secondly, whilst quite young, and by having in either case transmitted his modified plumage to the females and the young; or, thirdly, he may have varied when adult and transmitted his plumage to both adult sexes, and, owing to the failure of the law of inheritance at corresponding ages, at some subsequent period to his young. it is impossible to decide which of these three modes has generally prevailed throughout the present class of cases. that the males varied whilst young, and transmitted their variations to their offspring of both sexes, is the most probable. i may here add that i have, with little success, endeavoured, by consulting various works, to decide how far the period of variation in birds has generally determined the transmission of characters to one sex or to both. the two rules, often referred to (namely, that variations occurring late in life are transmitted to one and the same sex, whilst those which occur early in life are transmitted to both sexes), apparently hold good in the first (34. for instance, the males of tanagra aestiva and fringilla cyanea require three years, the male of fringilla ciris four years, to complete their beautiful plumage. (see audubon, 'ornith. biography,' vol. i. pp. 233, 280, 378). the harlequin duck takes three years (ibid. vol. iii. p. 614). the male of the gold pheasant, as i hear from mr. jenner weir, can be distinguished from the female when about three months old, but he does not acquire his full splendour until the end of the september in the following year.), second, and fourth classes of cases; but they fail in the third, often in the fifth (35. thus the ibis tantalus and grus americanus take four years, the flamingo several years, and the ardea ludovicana two years, before they acquire their perfect plumage. see audubon, ibid. vol. i. p. 221; vol. iii. pp. 133, 139, 211.), and in the sixth small class. they apply, however, as far as i can judge, to a considerable majority of the species; and we must not forget the striking generalisation by dr. w. marshall with respect to the protuberances on the heads of birds. whether or not the two rules generally hold good, we may conclude from the facts given in the eighth chapter, that the period of variation is one important element in determining the form of transmission. with birds it is difficult to decide by what standard we ought to judge of the earliness or lateness of the period of variation, whether by the age in reference to the duration of life, or to the power of reproduction, or to the number of moults through which the species passes. the moulting of birds, even within the same family, sometimes differs much without any assignable cause. some birds moult so early, that nearly all the body feathers are cast off before the first wing-feathers are fully grown; and we cannot believe that this was the primordial state of things. when the period of moulting has been accelerated, the age at which the colours of the adult plumage are first developed will falsely appear to us to be earlier than it really is. this may be illustrated by the practice followed by some bird-fanciers, who pull out a few feathers from the breast of nestling bullfinches, and from the head or neck of young gold-pheasants, in order to ascertain their sex; for in the males, these feathers are immediately replaced by coloured ones. (36. mr. blyth, in charlesworth's 'magazine of natural history,' vol. i. 1837, p. 300. mr. bartlett has informed me in regard to gold pheasants.) the actual duration of life is known in but few birds, so that we can hardly judge by this standard. and, with reference to the period at which the power of reproduction is gained, it is a remarkable fact that various birds occasionally breed whilst retaining their immature plumage. (37. i have noticed the following cases in audubon's 'ornith. biography.' the redstart of america (muscapica ruticilla, vol. i. p. 203). the ibis tantalus takes four years to come to full maturity, but sometimes breeds in the second year (vol. iii. p. 133). the grus americanus takes the same time, but breeds before acquiring its full plumage (vol. iii. p. 211). the adults of ardea caerulea are blue, and the young white; and white, mottled, and mature blue birds may all be seen breeding together (vol. iv. p. 58): but mr. blyth informs me that certain herons apparently are dimorphic, for white and coloured individuals of the same age may be observed. the harlequin duck (anas histrionica, linn.) takes three years to acquire its full plumage, though many birds breed in the second year (vol. iii. p. 614). the white-headed eagle (falco leucocephalus, vol. iii. p. 210) is likewise known to breed in its immature state. some species of oriolus (according to mr. blyth and mr. swinhoe, in 'ibis,' july 1863, p. 68) likewise breed before they attain their full plumage.) the fact of birds breeding in their immature plumage seems opposed to the belief that sexual selection has played as important a part, as i believe it has, in giving ornamental colours, plumes, etc., to the males, and, by means of equal transmission, to the females of many species. the objection would be a valid one, if the younger and less ornamented males were as successful in winning females and propagating their kind, as the older and more beautiful males. but we have no reason to suppose that this is the case. audubon speaks of the breeding of the immature males of ibis tantalus as a rare event, as does mr. swinhoe, in regard to the immature males of oriolus. (38. see footnote 37 above.) if the young of any species in their immature plumage were more successful in winning partners than the adults, the adult plumage would probably soon be lost, as the males would prevail, which retained their immature dress for the longest period, and thus the character of the species would ultimately be modified. (39. other animals, belonging to quite distinct classes, are either habitually or occasionally capable of breeding before they have fully acquired their adult characters. this is the case with the young males of the salmon. several amphibians have been known to breed whilst retaining their larval structure. fritz müller has shewn ('facts and arguments for darwin,' eng. trans. 1869, p. 79) that the males of several amphipod crustaceans become sexually mature whilst young; and i infer that this is a case of premature breeding, because they have not as yet acquired their fully-developed claspers. all such facts are highly interesting, as bearing on one means by which species may undergo great modifications of character.) if, on the other hand, the young never succeeded in obtaining a female, the habit of early reproduction would perhaps be sooner or later eliminated, from being superfluous and entailing waste of power. the plumage of certain birds goes on increasing in beauty during many years after they are fully mature; this is the case with the train of the peacock, with some of the birds of paradise, and with the crest and plumes of certain herons, for instance, the ardea ludovicana. (40. jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. iii. p. 507, on the peacock. dr. marshall thinks that the older and more brilliant males of birds of paradise, have an advantage over the younger males; see 'archives neerlandaises,' tom. vi. 1871.--on ardea, audubon, ibid. vol. iii. p. 139.) but it is doubtful whether the continued development of such feathers is the result of the selection of successive beneficial variations (though this is the most probable view with birds of paradise) or merely of continuous growth. most fishes continue increasing in size, as long as they are in good health and have plenty of food; and a somewhat similar law may prevail with the plumes of birds. class v. when the adults of both sexes have a distinct winter and summer plumage, whether or not the male differs from the female, the young resemble the adults of both sexes in their winter dress, or much more rarely in their summer dress, or they resemble the females alone. or the young may have an intermediate character; or, again, they may differ greatly from the adults in both their seasonal plumages. the cases in this class are singularly complex; nor is this surprising, as they depend on inheritance, limited in a greater or less degree in three different ways, namely, by sex, age, and the season of the year. in some cases the individuals of the same species pass through at least five distinct states of plumage. with the species, in which the male differs from the female during the summer season alone, or, which is rarer, during both seasons (41. for illustrative cases, see vol. iv. of macgillivray's 'history of british birds;' on tringa, etc., pp. 229, 271; on the machetes, p. 172; on the charadrius hiaticula, p. 118; on the charadrius pluvialis, p. 94.), the young generally resemble the females,--as with the so-called goldfinch of north america, and apparently with the splendid maluri of australia. (42. for the goldfinch of n. america, fringilla tristis, linn., see audubon, 'ornithological biography,' vol. i. p. 172. for the maluri, gould's 'handbook of the birds of australia,' vol. i. p. 318.) with those species, the sexes of which are alike during both the summer and winter, the young may resemble the adults, firstly, in their winter dress; secondly, and this is of much rarer occurrence, in their summer dress; thirdly, they may be intermediate between these two states; and, fourthly, they may differ greatly from the adults at all seasons. we have an instance of the first of these four cases in one of the egrets of india (buphus coromandus), in which the young and the adults of both sexes are white during the winter, the adults becoming golden-buff during the summer. with the gaper (anastomus oscitans) of india we have a similar case, but the colours are reversed: for the young and the adults of both sexes are grey and black during the winter, the adults becoming white during the summer. (43. i am indebted to mr. blyth for information as to the buphus; see also jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. iii. p. 749. on the anastomus, see blyth, in 'ibis,' 1867, p. 173.) as an instance of the second case, the young of the razor-bill (alca torda, linn.), in an early state of plumage, are coloured like the adults during the summer; and the young of the white- crowned sparrow of north america (fringilla leucophrys), as soon as fledged, have elegant white stripes on their heads, which are lost by the young and the old during the winter. (44. on the alca, see macgillivray, 'hist. brit. birds,' vol. v. p. 347. on the fringilla leucophrys, audubon, ibid. vol. ii. p. 89. i shall have hereafter to refer to the young of certain herons and egrets being white.) with respect to the third case, namely, that of the young having an intermediate character between the summer and winter adult plumages, yarrell (45. 'history of british birds,' vol. i. 1839, p. 159.) insists that this occurs with many waders. lastly, in regard to the young differing greatly from both sexes in their adult summer and winter plumages, this occurs with some herons and egrets of north america and india,--the young alone being white. i will make only a few remarks on these complicated cases. when the young resemble the females in their summer dress, or the adults of both sexes in their winter dress, the cases differ from those given under classes i. and iii. only in the characters originally acquired by the males during the breeding-season, having been limited in their transmission to the corresponding season. when the adults have a distinct summer and winter plumage, and the young differ from both, the case is more difficult to understand. we may admit as probable that the young have retained an ancient state of plumage; we can account by sexual selection for the summer or nuptial plumage of the adults, but how are we to account for their distinct winter plumage? if we could admit that this plumage serves in all cases as a protection, its acquirement would be a simple affair; but there seems no good reason for this admission. it may be suggested that the widely different conditions of life during the winter and summer have acted in a direct manner on the plumage; this may have had some effect, but i have not much confidence in so great a difference as we sometimes see between the two plumages, having been thus caused. a more probable explanation is, that an ancient style of plumage, partially modified through the transference of some characters from the summer plumage, has been retained by the adults during the winter. finally, all the cases in our present class apparently depend on characters acquired by the adult males, having been variously limited in their transmission according to age, season, and sex; but it would not be worth while to attempt to follow out these complex relations. class vi. the young in their first plumage differ from each other according to sex; the young males resembling more or less closely the adult males, and the young females more or less closely the adult females. the cases in the present class, though occurring in various groups, are not numerous; yet it seems the most natural thing that the young should at first somewhat resemble the adults of the same sex, and gradually become more and more like them. the adult male blackcap (sylvia atricapilla) has a black head, that of the female being reddish-brown; and i am informed by mr. blyth, that the young of both sexes can be distinguished by this character even as nestlings. in the family of thrushes an unusual number of similar cases have been noticed; thus, the male blackbird (turdus merula) can be distinguished in the nest from the female. the two sexes of the mocking bird (turdus polyglottus, linn.) differ very little from each other, yet the males can easily be distinguished at a very early age from the females by showing more pure white. (46. audubon, 'ornith. biography,' vol. i. p. 113.) the males of a forest-thrush and of a rock- thrush (orocetes erythrogastra and petrocincla cyanea) have much of their plumage of a fine blue, whilst the females are brown; and the nestling males of both species have their main wing and tail-feathers edged with blue whilst those of the female are edged with brown. (47. mr. c.a. wright, in 'ibis,' vol. vi. 1864, p. 65. jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. i. p. 515. see also on the blackbird, blyth in charlesworth's 'magazine of natural history,' vol. i. 1837, p. 113.) in the young blackbird the wing- feathers assume their mature character and become black after the others; on the other hand, in the two species just named the wing-feathers become blue before the others. the most probable view with reference to the cases in the present class is that the males, differently from what occurs in class i., have transmitted their colours to their male offspring at an earlier age than that at which they were first acquired; for, if the males had varied whilst quite young, their characters would probably have been transmitted to both sexes. (48. the following additional cases may be mentioned; the young males of tanagra rubra can be distinguished from the young females (audubon, 'ornith. biography,' vol. iv. p. 392), and so it is within the nestlings of a blue nuthatch, dendrophila frontalis of india (jerdon, 'birds of india,' vol. i. p. 389). mr. blyth also informs me that the sexes of the stonechat, saxicola rubicola, are distinguishable at a very early age. mr. salvin gives ('proc. zoolog. soc.' 1870, p. 206) the case of a humming-bird, like the following one of eustephanus.) in aithurus polytmus, a humming-bird, the male is splendidly coloured black and green, and two of the tail-feathers are immensely lengthened; the female has an ordinary tail and inconspicuous colours; now the young males, instead of resembling the adult female, in accordance with the common rule, begin from the first to assume the colours proper to their sex, and their tail-feathers soon become elongated. i owe this information to mr. gould, who has given me the following more striking and as yet unpublished case. two humming-birds belonging to the genus eustephanus, both beautifully coloured, inhabit the small island of juan fernandez, and have always been ranked as specifically distinct. but it has lately been ascertained that the one which is of a rich chestnut-brown colour with a golden-red head, is the male, whilst the other which is elegantly variegated with green and white with a metallic green head is the female. now the young from the first somewhat resemble the adults of the corresponding sex, the resemblance gradually becoming more and more complete. in considering this last case, if as before we take the plumage of the young as our guide, it would appear that both sexes have been rendered beautiful independently; and not that one sex has partially transferred its beauty to the other. the male apparently has acquired his bright colours through sexual selection in the same manner as, for instance, the peacock or pheasant in our first class of cases; and the female in the same manner as the female rhynchaea or turnix in our second class of cases. but there is much difficulty in understanding how this could have been effected at the same time with the two sexes of the same species. mr. salvin states, as we have seen in the eighth chapter, that with certain humming-birds the males greatly exceed the females in number, whilst with other species inhabiting the same country the females greatly exceed the males. if, then, we might assume that during some former lengthened period the males of the juan fernandez species had greatly exceeded the females in number, but that during another lengthened period the females had far exceeded the males, we could understand how the males at one time, and the females at another, might have been rendered beautiful by the selection of the brighter coloured individuals of either sex; both sexes transmitting their characters to their young at a rather earlier age than usual. whether this is the true explanation i will not pretend to say; but the case is too remarkable to be passed over without notice. we have now seen in all six classes, that an intimate relation exists between the plumage of the young and the adults, either of one sex or both. these relations are fairly well explained on the principle that one sex-- this being in the great majority of cases the male--first acquired through variation and sexual selection bright colours or other ornaments, and transmitted them in various ways, in accordance with the recognised laws of inheritance. why variations have occurred at different periods of life, even sometimes with species of the same group, we do not know, but with respect to the form of transmission, one important determining cause seems to be the age at which the variations first appear. from the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages, and from any variations in colour which occurred in the males at an early age not being then selected--on the contrary being often eliminated as dangerous--whilst similar variations occurring at or near the period of reproduction have been preserved, it follows that the plumage of the young will often have been left unmodified, or but little modified. we thus get some insight into the colouring of the progenitors of our existing species. in a vast number of species in five out of our six classes of cases, the adults of one sex or of both are bright coloured, at least during the breeding- season, whilst the young are invariably less brightly coloured than the adults, or are quite dull coloured; for no instance is known, as far as i can discover, of the young of dull-coloured species displaying bright colours, or of the young of bright-coloured species being more brilliant than their parents. in the fourth class, however, in which the young and the old resemble each other, there are many species (though by no means all), of which the young are bright-coloured, and as these form old groups, we may infer that their early progenitors were likewise bright. with this exception, if we look to the birds of the world, it appears that their beauty has been much increased since that period, of which their immature plumage gives us a partial record. on the colour of the plumage in relation to protection. it will have been seen that i cannot follow mr. wallace in the belief that dull colours, when confined to the females, have been in most cases specially gained for the sake of protection. there can, however, be no doubt, as formerly remarked, that both sexes of many birds have had their colours modified, so as to escape the notice of their enemies; or in some instances, so as to approach their prey unobserved, just as owls have had their plumage rendered soft, that their flight may not be overheard. mr. wallace remarks (49. 'westminster review,' july 1867, p. 5.) that "it is only in the tropics, among forests which never lose their foliage, that we find whole groups of birds, whose chief colour is green." it will be admitted by every one, who has ever tried, how difficult it is to distinguish parrots in a leaf-covered tree. nevertheless, we must remember that many parrots are ornamented with crimson, blue, and orange tints, which can hardly be protective. woodpeckers are eminently arboreal, but besides green species, there are many black, and black-and-white kinds--all the species being apparently exposed to nearly the same dangers. it is therefore probable that with tree-haunting birds, strongly-pronounced colours have been acquired through sexual selection, but that a green tint has been acquired oftener than any other, from the additional advantage of protection. in regard to birds which live on the ground, every one admits that they are coloured so as to imitate the surrounding surface. how difficult it is to see a partridge, snipe, woodcock, certain plovers, larks, and night-jars when crouched on ground. animals inhabiting deserts offer the most striking cases, for the bare surface affords no concealment, and nearly all the smaller quadrupeds, reptiles, and birds depend for safety on their colours. mr. tristram has remarked in regard to the inhabitants of the sahara, that all are protected by their "isabelline or sand-colour." (50. 'ibis,' 1859, vol. i. p. 429, et seq. dr. rohlfs, however, remarks to me in a letter that according to his experience of the sahara, this statement is too strong.) calling to my recollection the desert-birds of south america, as well as most of the ground-birds of great britain, it appeared to me that both sexes in such cases are generally coloured nearly alike. accordingly, i applied to mr. tristram with respect to the birds of the sahara, and he has kindly given me the following information. there are twenty-six species belonging to fifteen genera, which manifestly have their plumage coloured in a protective manner; and this colouring is all the more striking, as with most of these birds it differs from that of their congeners. both sexes of thirteen out of the twenty-six species are coloured in the same manner; but these belong to genera in which this rule commonly prevails, so that they tell us nothing about the protective colours being the same in both sexes of desert-birds. of the other thirteen species, three belong to genera in which the sexes usually differ from each other, yet here they have the sexes alike. in the remaining ten species, the male differs from the female; but the difference is confined chiefly to the under surface of the plumage, which is concealed when the bird crouches on the ground; the head and back being of the same sand- coloured hue in the two sexes. so that in these ten species the upper surfaces of both sexes have been acted on and rendered alike, through natural selection, for the sake of protection; whilst the lower surfaces of the males alone have been diversified, through sexual selection, for the sake of ornament. here, as both sexes are equally well protected, we clearly see that the females have not been prevented by natural selection from inheriting the colours of their male parents; so that we must look to the law of sexually-limited transmission. in all parts of the world both sexes of many soft-billed birds, especially those which frequent reeds or sedges, are obscurely coloured. no doubt if their colours had been brilliant, they would have been much more conspicuous to their enemies; but whether their dull tints have been specially gained for the sake of protection seems, as far as i can judge, rather doubtful. it is still more doubtful whether such dull tints can have been gained for the sake of ornament. we must, however, bear in mind that male birds, though dull-coloured, often differ much from their females (as with the common sparrow), and this leads to the belief that such colours have been gained through sexual selection, from being attractive. many of the soft-billed birds are songsters; and a discussion in a former chapter should not be forgotten, in which it was shewn that the best songsters are rarely ornamented with bright tints. it would appear that female birds, as a general rule, have selected their mates either for their sweet voices or gay colours, but not for both charms combined. some species, which are manifestly coloured for the sake of protection, such as the jack-snipe, woodcock, and night-jar, are likewise marked and shaded, according to our standard of taste, with extreme elegance. in such cases we may conclude that both natural and sexual selection have acted conjointly for protection and ornament. whether any bird exists which does not possess some special attraction, by which to charm the opposite sex, may be doubted. when both sexes are so obscurely coloured that it would be rash to assume the agency of sexual selection, and when no direct evidence can be advanced shewing that such colours serve as a protection, it is best to own complete ignorance of the cause, or, which comes to nearly the same thing, to attribute the result to the direct action of the conditions of life. both sexes of many birds are conspicuously, though not brilliantly coloured, such as the numerous black, white, or piebald species; and these colours are probably the result of sexual selection. with the common blackbird, capercailzie, blackcock, black scoter-duck (oidemia), and even with one of the birds of paradise (lophorina atra), the males alone are black, whilst the females are brown or mottled; and there can hardly be a doubt that blackness in these cases has been a sexually selected character. therefore it is in some degree probable that the complete or partial blackness of both sexes in such birds as crows, certain cockatoos, storks, and swans, and many marine birds, is likewise the result of sexual selection, accompanied by equal transmission to both sexes; for blackness can hardly serve in any case as a protection. with several birds, in which the male alone is black, and in others in which both sexes are black, the beak or skin about the head is brightly coloured, and the contrast thus afforded adds much to their beauty; we see this in the bright yellow beak of the male blackbird, in the crimson skin over the eyes of the blackcock and capercailzie, in the brightly and variously coloured beak of the scoter-drake (oidemia), in the red beak of the chough (corvus graculus, linn.), of the black swan, and the black stork. this leads me to remark that it is not incredible that toucans may owe the enormous size of their beaks to sexual selection, for the sake of displaying the diversified and vivid stripes of colour, with which these organs are ornamented. (51. no satisfactory explanation has ever been offered of the immense size, and still less of the bright colours, of the toucan's beak. mr. bates ('the naturalist on the amazons,' vol. ii. 1863, p. 341) states that they use their beaks for reaching fruit at the extreme tips of the branches; and likewise, as stated by other authors, for extracting eggs and young birds from the nests of other birds. but, as mr. bates admits, the beak "can scarcely be considered a very perfectly-formed instrument for the end to which it is applied." the great bulk of the beak, as shewn by its breadth, depth, as well as length, is not intelligible on the view, that it serves merely as an organ of prehension. mr. belt believes ('the naturalist in nicaragua,' p. 197) that the principal use of the beak is as a defence against enemies, especially to the female whilst nesting in a hole in a tree.) the naked skin, also, at the base of the beak and round the eyes is likewise often brilliantly coloured; and mr. gould, in speaking of one species (52. rhamphastos carinatus, gould's 'monograph of ramphastidae.'), says that the colours of the beak "are doubtless in the finest and most brilliant state during the time of pairing." there is no greater improbability that toucans should be encumbered with immense beaks, though rendered as light as possible by their cancellated structure, for the display of fine colours (an object falsely appearing to us unimportant), than that the male argus pheasant and some other birds should be encumbered with plumes so long as to impede their flight. in the same manner, as the males alone of various species are black, the females being dull-coloured; so in a few cases the males alone are either wholly or partially white, as with the several bell-birds of south america (chasmorhynchus), the antarctic goose (bernicla antarctica), the silver pheasant, etc., whilst the females are brown or obscurely mottled. therefore, on the same principle as before, it is probable that both sexes of many birds, such as white cockatoos, several egrets with their beautiful plumes, certain ibises, gulls, terns, etc., have acquired their more or less completely white plumage through sexual selection. in some of these cases the plumage becomes white only at maturity. this is the case with certain gannets, tropic-birds, etc., and with the snow-goose (anser hyperboreus). as the latter breeds on the "barren grounds," when not covered with snow, and as it migrates southward during the winter, there is no reason to suppose that its snow-white adult plumage serves as a protection. in the anastomus oscitans, we have still better evidence that the white plumage is a nuptial character, for it is developed only during the summer; the young in their immature state, and the adults in their winter dress, being grey and black. with many kinds of gulls (larus), the head and neck become pure white during the summer, being grey or mottled during the winter and in the young state. on the other hand, with the smaller gulls, or sea-mews (gavia), and with some terns (sterna), exactly the reverse occurs; for the heads of the young birds during the first year, and of the adults during the winter, are either pure white, or much paler coloured than during the breeding-season. these latter cases offer another instance of the capricious manner in which sexual selection appears often to have acted. (53. on larus, gavia, and sterna, see macgillivray, 'history of british birds,' vol. v. pp. 515, 584, 626. on the anser hyperboreus, audubon, 'ornithological biography,' vol. iv. p. 562. on the anastomus, mr. blyth, in 'ibis,' 1867, p. 173.) that aquatic birds have acquired a white plumage so much oftener than terrestrial birds, probably depends on their large size and strong powers of flight, so that they can easily defend themselves or escape from birds of prey, to which moreover they are not much exposed. consequently, sexual selection has not here been interfered with or guided for the sake of protection. no doubt with birds which roam over the open ocean, the males and females could find each other much more easily, when made conspicuous either by being perfectly white or intensely black; so that these colours may possibly serve the same end as the call-notes of many land-birds. (54. it may be noticed that with vultures, which roam far and wide high in the air, like marine birds over the ocean, three or four species are almost wholly or largely white, and that many others are black. so that here again conspicuous colours may possibly aid the sexes in finding each other during the breeding-season.) a white or black bird when it discovers and flies down to a carcase floating on the sea or cast up on the beach, will be seen from a great distance, and will guide other birds of the same and other species, to the prey; but as this would be a disadvantage to the first finders, the individuals which were the whitest or blackest would not thus procure more food than the less strongly coloured individuals. hence conspicuous colours cannot have been gradually acquired for this purpose through natural selection. as sexual selection depends on so fluctuating an element as taste, we can understand how it is that, within the same group of birds having nearly the same habits, there should exist white or nearly white, as well as black, or nearly black species,--for instance, both white and black cockatoos, storks, ibises, swans, terns, and petrels. piebald birds likewise sometimes occur in the same groups together with black and white species; for instance, the black-necked swan, certain terns, and the common magpie. that a strong contrast in colour is agreeable to birds, we may conclude by looking through any large collection, for the sexes often differ from each other in the male having the pale parts of a purer white, and the variously coloured dark parts of still darker tints than the female. it would even appear that mere novelty, or slight changes for the sake of change, have sometimes acted on female birds as a charm, like changes of fashion with us. thus the males of some parrots can hardly be said to be more beautiful than the females, at least according to our taste, but they differ in such points, as in having a rose-coloured collar instead of "a bright emeraldine narrow green collar"; or in the male having a black collar instead of "a yellow demi-collar in front," with a pale roseate instead of a plum-blue head. (55. see jerdon on the genus palaeornis, 'birds of india,' vol. i. pp. 258-260.) as so many male birds have elongated tail-feathers or elongated crests for their chief ornament, the shortened tail, formerly described in the male of a humming-bird, and the shortened crest of the male goosander, seem like one of the many changes of fashion which we admire in our own dresses. some members of the heron family offer a still more curious case of novelty in colouring having, as it appears, been appreciated for the sake of novelty. the young of the ardea asha are white, the adults being dark slate-coloured; and not only the young, but the adults in their winter plumage, of the allied buphus coromandus are white, this colour changing into a rich golden-buff during the breeding-season. it is incredible that the young of these two species, as well as of some other members of the same family (56. the young of ardea rufescens and a. caerulea of the united states are likewise white, the adults being coloured in accordance with their specific names. audubon ('ornithological biography,' vol. iii. p. 416; vol. iv. p. 58) seems rather pleased at the thought that this remarkable change of plumage will greatly "disconcert the systematists."), should for any special purpose have been rendered pure white and thus made conspicuous to their enemies; or that the adults of one of these two species should have been specially rendered white during the winter in a country which is never covered with snow. on the other hand we have good reason to believe that whiteness has been gained by many birds as a sexual ornament. we may therefore conclude that some early progenitor of the ardea asha and the buphus acquired a white plumage for nuptial purposes, and transmitted this colour to their young; so that the young and the old became white like certain existing egrets; and that the whiteness was afterwards retained by the young, whilst it was exchanged by the adults for more strongly-pronounced tints. but if we could look still further back to the still earlier progenitors of these two species, we should probably see the adults dark-coloured. i infer that this would be the case, from the analogy of many other birds, which are dark whilst young, and when adult are white; and more especially from the case of the ardea gularis, the colours of which are the reverse of those of a. asha, for the young are dark-coloured and the adults white, the young having retained a former state of plumage. it appears therefore that, during a long line of descent, the adult progenitors of the ardea asha, the buphus, and of some allies, have undergone the following changes of colour: first, a dark shade; secondly, pure white; and thirdly, owing to another change of fashion (if i may so express myself), their present slaty, reddish, or golden-buff tints. these successive changes are intelligible only on the principle of novelty having been admired by birds for its own sake. several writers have objected to the whole theory of sexual selection, by assuming that with animals and savages the taste of the female for certain colours or other ornaments would not remain constant for many generations; that first one colour and then another would be admired, and consequently that no permanent effect could be produced. we may admit that taste is fluctuating, but it is not quite arbitrary. it depends much on habit, as we see in mankind; and we may infer that this would hold good with birds and other animals. even in our own dress, the general character lasts long, and the changes are to a certain extent graduated. abundant evidence will be given in two places in a future chapter, that savages of many races have admired for many generations the same cicatrices on the skin, the same hideously perforated lips, nostrils, or ears, distorted heads, etc.; and these deformities present some analogy to the natural ornaments of various animals. nevertheless, with savages such fashions do not endure for ever, as we may infer from the differences in this respect between allied tribes on the same continent. so again the raisers of fancy animals certainly have admired for many generations and still admire the same breeds; they earnestly desire slight changes, which are considered as improvements, but any great or sudden change is looked at as the greatest blemish. with birds in a state of nature we have no reason to suppose that they would admire an entirely new style of coloration, even if great and sudden variations often occurred, which is far from being the case. we know that dovecot pigeons do not willingly associate with the variously coloured fancy breeds; that albino birds do not commonly get partners in marriage; and that the black ravens of the feroe islands chase away their piebald brethren. but this dislike of a sudden change would not preclude their appreciating slight changes, any more than it does in the case of man. hence with respect to taste, which depends on many elements, but partly on habit and partly on a love of novelty, there seems no improbability in animals admiring for a very long period the same general style of ornamentation or other attractions, and yet appreciating slight changes in colours, form, or sound. summary of the four chapters on birds. most male birds are highly pugnacious during the breeding-season, and some possess weapons adapted for fighting with their rivals. but the most pugnacious and the best armed males rarely or never depend for success solely on their power to drive away or kill their rivals, but have special means for charming the female. with some it is the power of song, or of giving forth strange cries, or instrumental music, and the males in consequence differ from the females in their vocal organs, or in the structure of certain feathers. from the curiously diversified means for producing various sounds, we gain a high idea of the importance of this means of courtship. many birds endeavour to charm the females by love- dances or antics, performed on the ground or in the air, and sometimes at prepared places. but ornaments of many kinds, the most brilliant tints, combs and wattles, beautiful plumes, elongated feathers, top-knots, and so forth, are by far the commonest means. in some cases mere novelty appears to have acted as a charm. the ornaments of the males must be highly important to them, for they have been acquired in not a few cases at the cost of increased danger from enemies, and even at some loss of power in fighting with their rivals. the males of very many species do not assume their ornamental dress until they arrive at maturity, or they assume it only during the breeding-season, or the tints then become more vivid. certain ornamental appendages become enlarged, turgid, and brightly coloured during the act of courtship. the males display their charms with elaborate care and to the best effect; and this is done in the presence of the females. the courtship is sometimes a prolonged affair, and many males and females congregate at an appointed place. to suppose that the females do not appreciate the beauty of the males, is to admit that their splendid decorations, all their pomp and display, are useless; and this is incredible. birds have fine powers of discrimination, and in some few instances it can be shewn that they have a taste for the beautiful. the females, moreover, are known occasionally to exhibit a marked preference or antipathy for certain individual males. if it be admitted that the females prefer, or are unconsciously excited by the more beautiful males, then the males would slowly but surely be rendered more and more attractive through sexual selection. that it is this sex which has been chiefly modified, we may infer from the fact that, in almost every genus where the sexes differ, the males differ much more from one another than do the females; this is well shewn in certain closely-allied representative species, in which the females can hardly be distinguished, whilst the males are quite distinct. birds in a state of nature offer individual differences which would amply suffice for the work of sexual selection; but we have seen that they occasionally present more strongly marked variations which recur so frequently that they would immediately be fixed, if they served to allure the female. the laws of variation must determine the nature of the initial changes, and will have largely influenced the final result. the gradations, which may be observed between the males of allied species, indicate the nature of the steps through which they have passed. they explain also in the most interesting manner how certain characters have originated, such as the indented ocelli on the tail-feathers of the peacock, and the ball-and-socket ocelli on the wing-feathers of the argus pheasant. it is evident that the brilliant colours, top-knots, fine plumes, etc., of many male birds cannot have been acquired as a protection; indeed, they sometimes lead to danger. that they are not due to the direct and definite action of the conditions of life, we may feel assured, because the females have been exposed to the same conditions, and yet often differ from the males to an extreme degree. although it is probable that changed conditions acting during a lengthened period have in some cases produced a definite effect on both sexes, or sometimes on one sex alone, the more important result will have been an increased tendency to vary or to present more strongly-marked individual differences; and such differences will have afforded an excellent ground- work for the action of sexual selection. the laws of inheritance, irrespectively of selection, appear to have determined whether the characters acquired by the males for the sake of ornament, for producing various sounds, and for fighting together, have been transmitted to the males alone or to both sexes, either permanently, or periodically during certain seasons of the year. why various characters should have been transmitted sometimes in one way and sometimes in another, is not in most cases known; but the period of variability seems often to have been the determining cause. when the two sexes have inherited all characters in common they necessarily resemble each other; but as the successive variations may be differently transmitted, every possible gradation may be found, even within the same genus, from the closest similarity to the widest dissimilarity between the sexes. with many closely-allied species, following nearly the same habits of life, the males have come to differ from each other chiefly through the action of sexual selection; whilst the females have come to differ chiefly from partaking more or less of the characters thus acquired by the males. the effects, moreover, of the definite action of the conditions of life, will not have been masked in the females, as in the males, by the accumulation through sexual selection of strongly-pronounced colours and other ornaments. the individuals of both sexes, however affected, will have been kept at each successive period nearly uniform by the free intercrossing of many individuals. with species, in which the sexes differ in colour, it is possible or probable that some of the successive variations often tended to be transmitted equally to both sexes; but that when this occurred the females were prevented from acquiring the bright colours of the males, by the destruction which they suffered during incubation. there is no evidence that it is possible by natural selection to convert one form of transmission into another. but there would not be the least difficulty in rendering a female dull-coloured, the male being still kept bright- coloured, by the selection of successive variations, which were from the first limited in their transmission to the same sex. whether the females of many species have actually been thus modified, must at present remain doubtful. when, through the law of the equal transmission of characters to both sexes, the females were rendered as conspicuously coloured as the males, their instincts appear often to have been modified so that they were led to build domed or concealed nests. in one small and curious class of cases the characters and habits of the two sexes have been completely transposed, for the females are larger, stronger, more vociferous and brighter coloured than the males. they have, also, become so quarrelsome that they often fight together for the possession of the males, like the males of other pugnacious species for the possession of the females. if, as seems probable, such females habitually drive away their rivals, and by the display of their bright colours or other charms endeavour to attract the males, we can understand how it is that they have gradually been rendered, by sexual selection and sexually- limited transmission, more beautiful than the males--the latter being left unmodified or only slightly modified. whenever the law of inheritance at corresponding ages prevails but not that of sexually-limited transmission, then if the parents vary late in life-- and we know that this constantly occurs with our poultry, and occasionally with other birds--the young will be left unaffected, whilst the adults of both sexes will be modified. if both these laws of inheritance prevail and either sex varies late in life, that sex alone will be modified, the other sex and the young being unaffected. when variations in brightness or in other conspicuous characters occur early in life, as no doubt often happens, they will not be acted on through sexual selection until the period of reproduction arrives; consequently if dangerous to the young, they will be eliminated through natural selection. thus we can understand how it is that variations arising late in life have so often been preserved for the ornamentation of the males; the females and the young being left almost unaffected, and therefore like each other. with species having a distinct summer and winter plumage, the males of which either resemble or differ from the females during both seasons or during the summer alone, the degrees and kinds of resemblance between the young and the old are exceedingly complex; and this complexity apparently depends on characters, first acquired by the males, being transmitted in various ways and degrees, as limited by age, sex, and season. as the young of so many species have been but little modified in colour and in other ornaments, we are enabled to form some judgment with respect to the plumage of their early progenitors; and we may infer that the beauty of our existing species, if we look to the whole class, has been largely increased since that period, of which the immature plumage gives us an indirect record. many birds, especially those which live much on the ground, have undoubtedly been obscurely coloured for the sake of protection. in some instances the upper exposed surface of the plumage has been thus coloured in both sexes, whilst the lower surface in the males alone has been variously ornamented through sexual selection. finally, from the facts given in these four chapters, we may conclude that weapons for battle, organs for producing sound, ornaments of many kinds, bright and conspicuous colours, have generally been acquired by the males through variation and sexual selection, and have been transmitted in various ways according to the several laws of inheritance--the females and the young being left comparatively but little modified. (57. i am greatly indebted to the kindness of mr. sclater for having looked over these four chapters on birds, and the two following ones on mammals. in this way i have been saved from making mistakes about the names of the species, and from stating anything as a fact which is known to this distinguished naturalist to be erroneous. but, of course, he is not at all answerable for the accuracy of the statements quoted by me from various authorities.) chapter xvii. secondary sexual characters of mammals. the law of battle--special weapons, confined to the males--cause of absence of weapons in the female--weapons common to both sexes, yet primarily acquired by the male--other uses of such weapons--their high importance-- greater size of the male--means of defence--on the preference shown by either sex in the pairing of quadrupeds. with mammals the male appears to win the female much more through the law of battle than through the display of his charms. the most timid animals, not provided with any special weapons for fighting, engage in desperate conflicts during the season of love. two male hares have been seen to fight together until one was killed; male moles often fight, and sometimes with fatal results; male squirrels engage in frequent contests, "and often wound each other severely"; as do male beavers, so that "hardly a skin is without scars." (1. see waterton's account of two hares fighting, 'zoologist,' vol. i. 1843, p. 211. on moles, bell, 'hist. of british quadrupeds,' 1st ed., p. 100. on squirrels, audubon and bachman, viviparous quadrupeds of n. america, 1846, p. 269. on beavers, mr. a.h. green, in 'journal of linnean society, zoology,' vol. x. 1869, p. 362.) i observed the same fact with the hides of the guanacoes in patagonia; and on one occasion several were so absorbed in fighting that they fearlessly rushed close by me. livingstone speaks of the males of the many animals in southern africa as almost invariably shewing the scars received in former contests. the law of battle prevails with aquatic as with terrestrial mammals. it is notorious how desperately male seals fight, both with their teeth and claws, during the breeding-season; and their hides are likewise often covered with scars. male sperm-whales are very jealous at this season; and in their battles "they often lock their jaws together, and turn on their sides and twist about"; so that their lower jaws often become distorted. (2. on the battles of seals, see capt. c. abbott in 'proc. zool. soc.' 1868, p. 191; mr. r. brown, ibid. 1868, p. 436; also l. lloyd, 'game birds of sweden,' 1867, p. 412; also pennant. on the sperm-whale see mr. j.h. thompson, in 'proc. zool. soc.' 1867, p. 246.) all male animals which are furnished with special weapons for fighting, are well known to engage in fierce battles. the courage and the desperate conflicts of stags have often been described; their skeletons have been found in various parts of the world, with the horns inextricably locked together, shewing how miserably the victor and vanquished had perished. (3. see scrope ('art of deer-stalking,' p. 17) on the locking of the horns with the cervus elaphus. richardson, in 'fauna bor. americana,' 1829, p. 252, says that the wapiti, moose, and reindeer have been found thus locked together. sir a. smith found at the cape of good hope the skeletons of two gnus in the same condition.) no animal in the world is so dangerous as an elephant in must. lord tankerville has given me a graphic description of the battles between the wild bulls in chillingham park, the descendants, degenerated in size but not in courage, of the gigantic bos primigenius. in 1861 several contended for mastery; and it was observed that two of the younger bulls attacked in concert the old leader of the herd, overthrew and disabled him, so that he was believed by the keepers to be lying mortally wounded in a neighbouring wood. but a few days afterwards one of the young bulls approached the wood alone; and then the "monarch of the chase," who had been lashing himself up for vengeance, came out and, in a short time, killed his antagonist. he then quietly joined the herd, and long held undisputed sway. admiral sir b.j. sulivan informs me that, when he lived in the falkland islands, he imported a young english stallion, which frequented the hills near port william with eight mares. on these hills there were two wild stallions, each with a small troop of mares; "and it is certain that these stallions would never have approached each other without fighting. both had tried singly to fight the english horse and drive away his mares, but had failed. one day they came in together and attacked him. this was seen by the capitan who had charge of the horses, and who, on riding to the spot, found one of the two stallions engaged with the english horse, whilst the other was driving away the mares, and had already separated four from the rest. the capitan settled the matter by driving the whole party into the corral, for the wild stallions would not leave the mares." male animals which are provided with efficient cutting or tearing teeth for the ordinary purposes of life, such as the carnivora, insectivora, and rodents, are seldom furnished with weapons especially adapted for fighting with their rivals. the case is very different with the males of many other animals. we see this in the horns of stags and of certain kinds of antelopes in which the females are hornless. with many animals the canine teeth in the upper or lower jaw, or in both, are much larger in the males than in the females, or are absent in the latter, with the exception sometimes of a hidden rudiment. certain antelopes, the musk-deer, camel, horse, boar, various apes, seals, and the walrus, offer instances. in the females of the walrus the tusks are sometimes quite absent. (4. mr. lamont ('seasons with the sea-horses,' 1861, p. 143) says that a good tusk of the male walrus weighs 4 pounds, and is longer than that of the female, which weighs about 3 pounds. the males are described as fighting ferociously. on the occasional absence of the tusks in the female, see mr. r. brown, 'proceedings, zoological society,' 1868, p. 429.) in the male elephant of india and in the male dugong (5. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 283.) the upper incisors form offensive weapons. in the male narwhal the left canine alone is developed into the well-known, spirally-twisted, so-called horn, which is sometimes from nine to ten feet in length. it is believed that the males use these horns for fighting together; for "an unbroken one can rarely be got, and occasionally one may be found with the point of another jammed into the broken place." (6. mr. r. brown, in 'proc. zool. soc.' 1869, p. 553. see prof. turner, in 'journal of anat. and phys.' 1872, p. 76, on the homological nature of these tusks. also mr. j.w. clarke on two tusks being developed in the males, in 'proceedings of the zoological society,' 1871, p. 42.) the tooth on the opposite side of the head in the male consists of a rudiment about ten inches in length, which is embedded in the jaw; but sometimes, though rarely, both are equally developed on the two sides. in the female both are always rudimentary. the male cachalot has a larger head than that of the female, and it no doubt aids him in his aquatic battles. lastly, the adult male ornithorhynchus is provided with a remarkable apparatus, namely a spur on the foreleg, closely resembling the poison-fang of a venomous snake; but according to harting, the secretion from the gland is not poisonous; and on the leg of the female there is a hollow, apparently for the reception of the spur. (7. owen on the cachalot and ornithorhynchus, ibid. vol. iii. pp. 638, 641. harting is quoted by dr. zouteveen in the dutch translation of this work, vol. ii. p. 292.) when the males are provided with weapons which in the females are absent, there can be hardly a doubt that these serve for fighting with other males; and that they were acquired through sexual selection, and were transmitted to the male sex alone. it is not probable, at least in most cases, that the females have been prevented from acquiring such weapons, on account of their being useless, superfluous, or in some way injurious. on the contrary, as they are often used by the males for various purposes, more especially as a defence against their enemies, it is a surprising fact that they are so poorly developed, or quite absent, in the females of so many animals. with female deer the development during each recurrent season of great branching horns, and with female elephants the development of immense tusks, would be a great waste of vital power, supposing that they were of no use to the females. consequently, they would have tended to be eliminated in the female through natural selection; that is, if the successive variations were limited in their transmission to the female sex, for otherwise the weapons of the males would have been injuriously affected, and this would have been a greater evil. on the whole, and from the consideration of the following facts, it seems probable that when the various weapons differ in the two sexes, this has generally depended on the kind of transmission which has prevailed. as the reindeer is the one species in the whole family of deer, in which the female is furnished with horns, though they are somewhat smaller, thinner, and less branched than in the male, it might naturally be thought that, at least in this case, they must be of some special service to her. the female retains her horns from the time when they are fully developed, namely, in september, throughout the winter until april or may, when she brings forth her young. mr. crotch made particular enquiries for me in norway, and it appears that the females at this season conceal themselves for about a fortnight in order to bring forth their young, and then reappear, generally hornless. in nova scotia, however, as i hear from mr. h. reeks, the female sometimes retains her horns longer. the male on the other hand casts his horns much earlier, towards the end of november. as both sexes have the same requirements and follow the same habits of life, and as the male is destitute of horns during the winter, it is improbable that they can be of any special service to the female during this season, which includes the larger part of the time during which she is horned. nor is it probable that she can have inherited horns from some ancient progenitor of the family of deer, for, from the fact of the females of so many species in all quarters of the globe not having horns, we may conclude that this was the primordial character of the group. (8. on the structure and shedding of the horns of the reindeer, hoffberg, 'amoenitates acad.' vol. iv. 1788, p. 149. see richardson, 'fauna bor. americana,' p. 241, in regard to the american variety or species: also major w. ross king, 'the sportsman in canada,' 1866, p. 80. the horns of the reindeer are developed at a most unusually early age; but what the cause of this may be is not known. the effect has apparently been the transference of the horns to both sexes. we should bear in mind that horns are always transmitted through the female, and that she has a latent capacity for their development, as we see in old or diseased females. (9. isidore geoffroy st.-hilaire, 'essais de zoolog. générale,' 1841, p. 513. other masculine characters, besides the horns, are sometimes similarly transferred to the female; thus mr. boner, in speaking of an old female chamois ('chamois hunting in the mountains of bavaria,' 1860, 2nd ed., p. 363), says, "not only was the head very male-looking, but along the back there was a ridge of long hair, usually to be found only in bucks.") moreover the females of some other species of deer exhibit, either normally or occasionally, rudiments of horns; thus the female of cervulus moschatus has "bristly tufts, ending in a knob, instead of a horn"; and "in most specimens of the female wapiti (cervus canadensis) there is a sharp bony protuberance in the place of the horn." (10. on the cervulus, dr. gray, 'catalogue of mammalia in the british museum,' part iii. p. 220. on the cervus canadensis or wapiti, see hon. j.d. caton, 'ottawa academy of nat. sciences,' may 1868, p. 9.) from these several considerations we may conclude that the possession of fairly well-developed horns by the female reindeer, is due to the males having first acquired them as weapons for fighting with other males; and secondarily to their development from some unknown cause at an unusually early age in the males, and their consequent transference to both sexes. turning to the sheath-horned ruminants: with antelopes a graduated series can be formed, beginning with species, the females of which are completely destitute of horns--passing on to those which have horns so small as to be almost rudimentary (as with the antilocapra americana, in which species they are present in only one out of four or five females (11. i am indebted to dr. canfield for this information; see also his paper in the 'proceedings of the zoological society,' 1866, p. 105.))--to those which have fairly developed horns, but manifestly smaller and thinner than in the male and sometimes of a different shape (12. for instance the horns of the female ant. euchore resemble those of a distinct species, viz. the ant. dorcas var. corine, see desmarest, 'mammalogie,' p. 455.),--and ending with those in which both sexes have horns of equal size. as with the reindeer, so with antelopes, there exists, as previously shewn, a relation between the period of the development of the horns and their transmission to one or both sexes; it is therefore probable that their presence or absence in the females of some species, and their more or less perfect condition in the females of other species, depends, not on their being of any special use, but simply on inheritance. it accords with this view that even in the same restricted genus both sexes of some species, and the males alone of others, are thus provided. it is also a remarkable fact that, although the females of antilope bezoartica are normally destitute of horns, mr. blyth has seen no less than three females thus furnished; and there was no reason to suppose that they were old or diseased. in all the wild species of goats and sheep the horns are larger in the male than in the female, and are sometimes quite absent in the latter. (13. gray, 'catalogue of mammalia, the british museum,' part iii. 1852, p. 160.) in several domestic breeds of these two animals, the males alone are furnished with horns; and in some breeds, for instance, in the sheep of north wales, though both sexes are properly horned, the ewes are very liable to be hornless. i have been informed by a trustworthy witness, who purposely inspected a flock of these same sheep during the lambing season, that the horns at birth are generally more fully developed in the male than in the female. mr. j. peel crossed his lonk sheep, both sexes of which always bear horns, with hornless leicesters and hornless shropshire downs; and the result was that the male offspring had their horns considerably reduced, whilst the females were wholly destitute of them. these several facts indicate that, with sheep, the horns are a much less firmly fixed character in the females than in the males; and this leads us to look at the horns as properly of masculine origin. with the adult musk-ox (ovibos moschatus) the horns of the male are larger than those of the female, and in the latter the bases do not touch. (14. richardson, 'fauna bor. americana,' p. 278.) in regard to ordinary cattle mr. blyth remarks: "in most of the wild bovine animals the horns are both longer and thicker in the bull than in the cow, and in the cow-banteng (bos sondaicus) the horns are remarkably small, and inclined much backwards. in the domestic races of cattle, both of the humped and humpless types, the horns are short and thick in the bull, longer and more slender in the cow and ox; and in the indian buffalo, they are shorter and thicker in the bull, longer and more slender in the cow. in the wild gaour (b. gaurus) the horns are mostly both longer and thicker in the bull than in the cow." (15. 'land and water,' 1867, p. 346.) dr. forsyth major also informs me that a fossil skull, believed to be that of the female bos etruscus, has been found in val d'arno, which is wholly without horns. in the rhinoceros simus, as i may add, the horns of the female are generally longer but less powerful than in the male; and in some other species of rhinoceros they are said to be shorter in the female. (16. sir andrew smith, 'zoology of s. africa,' pl. xix. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 624.) from these various facts we may infer as probable that horns of all kinds, even when they are equally developed in the two sexes, were primarily acquired by the male in order to conquer other males, and have been transferred more or less completely to the female. the effects of castration deserve notice, as throwing light on this same point. stags after the operation never renew their horns. the male reindeer, however, must be excepted, as after castration he does renew them. this fact, as well as the possession of horns by both sexes, seems at first to prove that the horns in this species do not constitute a sexual character (17. this is the conclusion of seidlitz, 'die darwinsche theorie,' 1871, p. 47.); but as they are developed at a very early age, before the sexes differ in constitution, it is not surprising that they should be unaffected by castration, even if they were aboriginally acquired by the male. with sheep both sexes properly bear horns; and i am informed that with welch sheep the horns of the males are considerably reduced by castration; but the degree depends much on the age at which the operation is performed, as is likewise the case with other animals. merino rams have large horns, whilst the ewes "generally speaking are without horns"; and in this breed castration seems to produce a somewhat greater effect, so that if performed at an early age the horns "remain almost undeveloped." (18. i am much obliged to prof. victor carus, for having made enquiries for me in saxony on this subject. h. von nathusius ('viehzucht,' 1872, p. 64) says that the horns of sheep castrated at an early period, either altogether disappear or remain as mere rudiments; but i do not know whether he refers to merinos or to ordinary breeds.) on the guinea coast there is a breed in which the females never bear horns, and, as mr. winwood reade informs me, the rams after castration are quite destitute of them. with cattle, the horns of the males are much altered by castration; for instead of being short and thick, they become longer than those of the cow, but otherwise resemble them. the antilope bezoartica offers a somewhat analogous case: the males have long straight spiral horns, nearly parallel to each other, and directed backwards; the females occasionally bear horns, but these when present are of a very different shape, for they are not spiral, and spreading widely, bend round with the points forwards. now it is a remarkable fact that, in the castrated male, as mr. blyth informs me, the horns are of the same peculiar shape as in the female, but longer and thicker. if we may judge from analogy, the female probably shews us, in these two cases of cattle and the antelope, the former condition of the horns in some early progenitor of each species. but why castration should lead to the reappearance of an early condition of the horns cannot be explained with any certainty. nevertheless, it seems probable, that in nearly the same manner as the constitutional disturbance in the offspring, caused by a cross between two distinct species or races, often leads to the reappearance of long-lost characters (19. i have given various experiments and other evidence proving that this is the case, in my 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. 1868, pp. 39-47.); so here, the disturbance in the constitution of the individual, resulting from castration, produces the same effect. the tusks of the elephant, in the different species or races, differ according to sex, nearly as do the horns of ruminants. in india and malacca the males alone are provided with well-developed tusks. the elephant of ceylon is considered by most naturalists as a distinct race, but by some as a distinct species, and here "not one in a hundred is found with tusks, the few that possess them being exclusively males." (20. sir j. emerson tennent, 'ceylon,' 1859, vol. ii. p. 274. for malacca, 'journal of indian archipelago,' vol. iv. p. 357.) the african elephant is undoubtedly distinct, and the female has large well-developed tusks, though not so large as those of the male. these differences in the tusks of the several races and species of elephants--the great variability of the horns of deer, as notably in the wild reindeer--the occasional presence of horns in the female antilope bezoartica, and their frequent absence in the female of antilocapra americana--the presence of two tusks in some few male narwhals--the complete absence of tusks in some female walruses--are all instances of the extreme variability of secondary sexual characters, and of their liability to differ in closely-allied forms. although tusks and horns appear in all cases to have been primarily developed as sexual weapons, they often serve other purposes. the elephant uses his tusks in attacking the tiger; according to bruce, he scores the trunks of trees until they can be thrown down easily, and he likewise thus extracts the farinaceous cores of palms; in africa he often uses one tusk, always the same, to probe the ground and thus ascertain whether it will bear his weight. the common bull defends the herd with his horns; and the elk in sweden has been known, according to lloyd, to strike a wolf dead with a single blow of his great horns. many similar facts could be given. one of the most curious secondary uses to which the horns of an animal may be occasionally put is that observed by captain hutton (21. 'calcutta journal of natural history,' vol. ii, 1843, p. 526.) with the wild goat (capra aegagrus) of the himalayas and, as it is also said with the ibex, namely that when the male accidentally falls from a height he bends inwards his head, and by alighting on his massive horns, breaks the shock. the female cannot thus use her horns, which are smaller, but from her more quiet disposition she does not need this strange kind of shield so much. each male animal uses his weapons in his own peculiar fashion. the common ram makes a charge and butts with such force with the bases of his horns, that i have seen a powerful man knocked over like a child. goats and certain species of sheep, for instance the ovis cycloceros of afghanistan (22. mr. blyth, in 'land and water,' march, 1867, p. 134, on the authority of capt. hutton and others. for the wild pembrokeshire goats, see the 'field,' 1869, p. 150.), rear on their hind legs, and then not only butt, but "make a cut down and a jerk up, with the ribbed front of their scimitar-shaped horn, as with a sabre. when the o. cycloceros attacked a large domestic ram, who was a noted bruiser, he conquered him by the sheer novelty of his mode of fighting, always closing at once with his adversary, and catching him across the face and nose with a sharp drawing jerk of the head, and then bounding out of the way before the blow could be returned." in pembrokeshire a male goat, the master of a flock which during several generations had run wild, was known to have killed several males in single combat; this goat possessed enormous horns, measuring thirty-nine inches in a straight line from tip to tip. the common bull, as every one knows, gores and tosses his opponent; but the italian buffalo is said never to use his horns: he gives a tremendous blow with his convex forehead, and then tramples on his fallen enemy with his knees--an instinct which the common bull does not possess. (23. m. e.m. bailly, "sur l'usage des cornes," etc., .annal des sciences nat.' tom. ii. 1824, p. 369.) hence a dog who pins a buffalo by the nose is immediately crushed. we must, however, remember that the italian buffalo has been long domesticated, and it is by no means certain that the wild parent-form had similar horns. mr. bartlett informs me that when a female cape buffalo (bubalus caffer) was turned into an enclosure with a bull of the same species, she attacked him, and he in return pushed her about with great violence. but it was manifest to mr. bartlett that, had not the bull shewn dignified forbearance, he could easily have killed her by a single lateral thrust with his immense horns. the giraffe uses his short, hair-covered horns, which are rather longer in the male than in the female, in a curious manner; for, with his long neck, he swings his head to either side, almost upside down, with such force that i have seen a hard plank deeply indented by a single blow. [fig. 63. oryx leucoryx, male (from the knowsley menagerie).] with antelopes it is sometimes difficult to imagine how they can possibly use their curiously-shaped horns; thus the springboc (ant. euchore) has rather short upright horns, with the sharp points bent inwards almost at right angles, so as to face each other; mr. bartlett does not know how they are used, but suggests that they would inflict a fearful wound down each side of the face of an antagonist. the slightly-curved horns of the oryx leucoryx (fig. 63) are directed backwards, and are of such length that their points reach beyond the middle of the back, over which they extend in almost parallel lines. thus they seem singularly ill-fitted for fighting; but mr. bartlett informs me that when two of these animals prepare for battle, they kneel down, with their heads between their fore legs, and in this attitude the horns stand nearly parallel and close to the ground, with the points directed forwards and a little upwards. the combatants then gradually approach each other, and each endeavours to get the upturned points under the body of the other; if one succeeds in doing this, he suddenly springs up, throwing up his head at the same time, and can thus wound or perhaps even transfix his antagonist. both animals always kneel down, so as to guard as far as possible against this manoeuvre. it has been recorded that one of these antelopes has used his horn with effect even against a lion; yet from being forced to place his head between the forelegs in order to bring the points of the horns forward, he would generally be under a great disadvantage when attacked by any other animal. it is, therefore, not probable that the horns have been modified into their present great length and peculiar position, as a protection against beasts of prey. we can however see that, as soon as some ancient male progenitor of the oryx acquired moderately long horns, directed a little backwards, he would be compelled, in his battles with rival males, to bend his head somewhat inwards or downwards, as is now done by certain stags; and it is not improbable that he might have acquired the habit of at first occasionally and afterwards of regularly kneeling down. in this case it is almost certain that the males which possessed the longest horns would have had a great advantage over others with shorter horns; and then the horns would gradually have been rendered longer and longer, through sexual selection, until they acquired their present extraordinary length and position. with stags of many kinds the branches of the horns offer a curious case of difficulty; for certainly a single straight point would inflict a much more serious wound than several diverging ones. in sir philip egerton's museum there is a horn of the red-deer (cervus elaphus), thirty inches in length, with "not fewer than fifteen snags or branches"; and at moritzburg there is still preserved a pair of antlers of a red-deer, shot in 1699 by frederick i., one of which bears the astonishing number of thirty-three branches and the other twenty-seven, making altogether sixty branches. richardson figures a pair of antlers of the wild reindeer with twenty-nine points. (24. on the horns of red-deer, owen, 'british fossil mammals,' 1846, p. 478; richardson on the horns of the reindeer, 'fauna bor. americana,' 1829, p. 240. i am indebted to prof. victor carus, for the moritzburg case.) from the manner in which the horns are branched, and more especially from deer being known occasionally to fight together by kicking with their fore- feet (25. hon. j.d. caton ('ottawa acad. of nat. science,' may 1868, p. 9) says that the american deer fight with their fore-feet, after "the question of superiority has been once settled and acknowledged in the herd." bailly, 'sur l'usage des cornes,' 'annales des sciences nat.' tom. ii. 1824, p. 371.), m. bailly actually comes to the conclusion that their horns are more injurious than useful to them. but this author overlooks the pitched battles between rival males. as i felt much perplexed about the use or advantage of the branches, i applied to mr. mcneill of colonsay, who has long and carefully observed the habits of red-deer, and he informs me that he has never seen some of the branches brought into use, but that the brow antlers, from inclining downwards, are a great protection to the forehead, and their points are likewise used in attack. sir philip egerton also informs me both as to red-deer and fallow-deer that, in fighting, they suddenly dash together, and getting their horns fixed against each other's bodies, a desperate struggle ensues. when one is at last forced to yield and turn round, the victor endeavours to plunge his brow antlers into his defeated foe. it thus appears that the upper branches are used chiefly or exclusively for pushing and fencing. nevertheless in some species the upper branches are used as weapons of offence; when a man was attacked by a wapiti deer (cervus canadensis) in judge caton's park in ottawa, and several men tried to rescue him, the stag "never raised his head from the ground; in fact he kept his face almost flat on the ground, with his nose nearly between his fore feet, except when he rolled his head to one side to take a new observation preparatory to a plunge." in this position the ends of the horns were directed against his adversaries. "in rolling his head he necessarily raised it somewhat, because his antlers were so long that he could not roll his head without raising them on one side, while, on the other side they touched the ground." the stag by this procedure gradually drove the party of rescuers backwards to a distance of 150 or 200 feet; and the attacked man was killed. (26. see a most interesting account in the appendix to hon. j.d. caton's paper, as above quoted.) [fig. 64. strepsiceros kudu (from sir andrew smith's 'zoology of south africa.'] although the horns of stags are efficient weapons, there can, i think, be no doubt that a single point would have been much more dangerous than a branched antler; and judge caton, who has had large experience with deer, fully concurs in this conclusion. nor do the branching horns, though highly important as a means of defence against rival stags, appear perfectly well adapted for this purpose, as they are liable to become interlocked. the suspicion has therefore crossed my mind that they may serve in part as ornaments. that the branched antlers of stags as well as the elegant lyrated horns of certain antelopes, with their graceful double curvature (fig. 64), are ornamental in our eyes, no one will dispute. if, then, the horns, like the splendid accoutrements of the knights of old, add to the noble appearance of stags and antelopes, they may have been modified partly for this purpose, though mainly for actual service in battle; but i have no evidence in favour of this belief. an interesting case has lately been published, from which it appears that the horns of a deer in one district in the united states are now being modified through sexual and natural selection. a writer in an excellent american journal (27. the 'american naturalist,' dec. 1869, p. 552.) says, that he has hunted for the last twenty-one years in the adirondacks, where the cervus virginianus abounds. about fourteen years ago he first heard of spike-horn bucks. these became from year to year more common; about five years ago he shot one, and afterwards another, and now they are frequently killed. "the spike-horn differs greatly from the common antler of the c. virginianus. it consists of a single spike, more slender than the antler, and scarcely half so long, projecting forward from the brow, and terminating in a very sharp point. it gives a considerable advantage to its possessor over the common buck. besides enabling him to run more swiftly through the thick woods and underbrush (every hunter knows that does and yearling bucks run much more rapidly than the large bucks when armed with their cumbrous antlers), the spike-horn is a more effective weapon than the common antler. with this advantage the spike-horn bucks are gaining upon the common bucks, and may, in time, entirely supersede them in the adirondacks. undoubtedly, the first spike-horn buck was merely an accidental freak of nature. but his spike-horns gave him an advantage, and enabled him to propagate his peculiarity. his descendants having a like advantage, have propagated the peculiarity in a constantly increasing ratio, till they are slowly crowding the antlered deer from the region they inhabit." a critic has well objected to this account by asking, why, if the simple horns are now so advantageous, were the branched antlers of the parent-form ever developed? to this i can only answer by remarking, that a new mode of attack with new weapons might be a great advantage, as shewn by the case of the ovis cycloceros, who thus conquered a domestic ram famous for his fighting power. though the branched antlers of a stag are well adapted for fighting with his rivals, and though it might be an advantage to the prong-horned variety slowly to acquire long and branched horns, if he had to fight only with others of the same kind, yet it by no means follows that branched horns would be the best fitted for conquering a foe differently armed. in the foregoing case of the oryx leucoryx, it is almost certain that the victory would rest with an antelope having short horns, and who therefore did not need to kneel down, though an oryx might profit by having still longer horns, if he fought only with his proper rivals. male quadrupeds, which are furnished with tusks, use them in various ways, as in the case of horns. the boar strikes laterally and upwards; the musk- deer downwards with serious effect. (28. pallas, 'spicilegia zoologica,' fasc. xiii. 1779, p. 18.) the walrus, though having so short a neck and so unwieldy a body, "can strike either upwards, or downwards, or sideways, with equal dexterity." (29. lamont, 'seasons with the sea-horses,' 1861, p. 141.) i was informed by the late dr. falconer, that the indian elephant fights in a different manner according to the position and curvature of his tusks. when they are directed forwards and upwards he is able to fling a tiger to a great distance--it is said to even thirty feet; when they are short and turned downwards he endeavours suddenly to pin the tiger to the ground and, in consequence, is dangerous to the rider, who is liable to be jerked off the howdah. (30. see also corse ('philosophical transactions,' 1799, p. 212) on the manner in which the short-tusked mooknah variety attacks other elephants.) very few male quadrupeds possess weapons of two distinct kinds specially adapted for fighting with rival males. the male muntjac-deer (cervulus), however, offers an exception, as he is provided with horns and exserted canine teeth. but we may infer from what follows that one form of weapon has often been replaced in the course of ages by another. with ruminants the development of horns generally stands in an inverse relation with that of even moderately developed canine teeth. thus camels, guanacoes, chevrotains, and musk-deer, are hornless, and they have efficient canines; these teeth being "always of smaller size in the females than in the males." the camelidae have, in addition to their true canines, a pair of canine-shaped incisors in their upper jaws. (31. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 349.) male deer and antelopes, on the other hand, possess horns, and they rarely have canine teeth; and these, when present, are always of small size, so that it is doubtful whether they are of any service in their battles. in antilope montana they exist only as rudiments in the young male, disappearing as he grows old; and they are absent in the female at all ages; but the females of certain other antelopes and of certain deer have been known occasionally to exhibit rudiments of these teeth. (32. see ruppell (in 'proc. zoolog. soc.' jan. 12, 1836, p. 3) on the canines in deer and antelopes, with a note by mr. martin on a female american deer. see also falconer ('palaeont. memoirs and notes,' vol. i. 1868, p. 576) on canines in an adult female deer. in old males of the musk-deer the canines (pallas, 'spic. zoolog.' fasc. xiii. 1779, p. 18) sometimes grow to the length of three inches, whilst in old females a rudiment projects scarcely half an inch above the gums.) stallions have small canine teeth, which are either quite absent or rudimentary in the mare; but they do not appear to be used in fighting, for stallions bite with their incisors, and do not open their mouths wide like camels and guanacoes. whenever the adult male possesses canines, now inefficient, whilst the female has either none or mere rudiments, we may conclude that the early male progenitor of the species was provided with efficient canines, which have been partially transferred to the females. the reduction of these teeth in the males seems to have followed from some change in their manner of fighting, often (but not in the horse) caused by the development of new weapons. tusks and horns are manifestly of high importance to their possessors, for their development consumes much organised matter. a single tusk of the asiatic elephant--one of the extinct woolly species--and of the african elephant, have been known to weigh respectively 150, 160, and 180 pounds; and even greater weights have been given by some authors. (33. emerson tennent, 'ceylon,' 1859, vol. ii. p. 275; owen, 'british fossil mammals,' 1846, p. 245.) with deer, in which the horns are periodically renewed, the drain on the constitution must be greater; the horns, for instance, of the moose weigh from fifty to sixty pounds, and those of the extinct irish elk from sixty to seventy pounds--the skull of the latter weighing on an average only five pounds and a quarter. although the horns are not periodically renewed in sheep, yet their development, in the opinion of many agriculturists, entails a sensible loss to the breeder. stags, moreover, in escaping from beasts of prey are loaded with an additional weight for the race, and are greatly retarded in passing through a woody country. the moose, for instance, with horns extending five and a half feet from tip to tip, although so skilful in their use that he will not touch or break a twig when walking quietly, cannot act so dexterously whilst rushing away from a pack of wolves. "during his progress he holds his nose up, so as to lay the horns horizontally back; and in this attitude cannot see the ground distinctly." (34. richardson, 'fauna bor. americana,' on the moose, alces palmata, pp. 236, 237; on the expanse of the horns, 'land and water,' 1869, p. 143. see also owen, 'british fossil mammals,' on the irish elk, pp. 447, 455.) the tips of the horns of the great irish elk were actually eight feet apart! whilst the horns are covered with velvet, which lasts with red-deer for about twelve weeks, they are extremely sensitive to a blow; so that in germany the stags at this time somewhat change their habits, and avoiding dense forests, frequent young woods and low thickets. (35. 'forest creatures,' by c. boner, 1861, p. 60.) these facts remind us that male birds have acquired ornamental plumes at the cost of retarded flight, and other ornaments at the cost of some loss of power in their battles with rival males. with mammals, when, as is often the case, the sexes differ in size, the males are almost always larger and stronger. i am informed by mr. gould that this holds good in a marked manner with the marsupials of australia, the males of which appear to continue growing until an unusually late age. but the most extraordinary case is that of one of the seals (callorhinus ursinus), a full-grown female weighing less than one-sixth of a full-grown male. (36. see the very interesting paper by mr. j.a. allen in 'bull. mus. comp. zoology of cambridge, united states,' vol. ii. no. 1, p. 82. the weights were ascertained by a careful observer, capt. bryant. dr. gill in 'the american naturalist,' january, 1871, prof. shaler on the relative size of the sexes of whales, 'american naturalist,' january, 1873.) dr. gill remarks that it is with the polygamous seals, the males of which are well known to fight savagely together, that the sexes differ much in size; the monogamous species differing but little. whales also afford evidence of the relation existing between the pugnacity of the males and their large size compared with that of the female; the males of the right-whales do not fight together, and they are not larger, but rather smaller, than their females; on the other hand, male sperm-whales fight much together, and their bodies are "often found scarred with the imprint of their rival's teeth," and they are double the size of the females. the greater strength of the male, as hunter long ago remarked (37. 'animal economy,' p. 45.), is invariably displayed in those parts of the body which are brought into action in fighting with rival males--for instance, in the massive neck of the bull. male quadrupeds are also more courageous and pugnacious than the females. there can be little doubt that these characters have been gained, partly through sexual selection, owing to a long series of victories, by the stronger and more courageous males over the weaker, and partly through the inherited effects of use. it is probable that the successive variations in strength, size, and courage, whether due to mere variability or to the effects of use, by the accumulation of which male quadrupeds have acquired these characteristic qualities, occurred rather late in life, and were consequently to a large extent limited in their transmission to the same sex. from these considerations i was anxious to obtain information as to the scotch deer-hound, the sexes of which differ more in size than those of any other breed (though blood-hounds differ considerably), or than in any wild canine species known to me. accordingly, i applied to mr. cupples, well known for his success with this breed, who has weighed and measured many of his own dogs, and who has with great kindness collected for me the following facts from various sources. fine male dogs, measured at the shoulder, range from 28 inches, which is low, to 33 or even 34 inches in height; and in weight from 80 pounds, which is light, to 120 pounds, or even more. the females range in height from 23 to 27, or even to 28 inches; and in weight from 50 to 70, or even 80 pounds. (38. see also richardson's 'manual on the dog,' p. 59. much valuable information on the scottish deer-hound is given by mr. mcneill, who first called attention to the inequality in size between the sexes, in scrope's 'art of deer- stalking.' i hope that mr. cupples will keep to his intention of publishing a full account and history of this famous breed.) mr. cupples concludes that from 95 to 100 pounds for the male, and 70 for the female, would be a safe average; but there is reason to believe that formerly both sexes attained a greater weight. mr. cupples has weighed puppies when a fortnight old; in one litter the average weight of four males exceeded that of two females by six and a half ounces; in another litter the average weight of four males exceeded that of one female by less than one ounce; the same males when three weeks old, exceeded the female by seven and a half ounces, and at the age of six weeks by nearly fourteen ounces. mr. wright of yeldersley house, in a letter to mr. cupples, says: "i have taken notes on the sizes and weights of puppies of many litters, and as far as my experience goes, dog-puppies as a rule differ very little from bitches till they arrive at about five or six months old; and then the dogs begin to increase, gaining upon the bitches both in weight and size. at birth, and for several weeks afterwards, a bitch-puppy will occasionally be larger than any of the dogs, but they are invariably beaten by them later." mr. mcneill, of colonsay, concludes that "the males do not attain their full growth till over two years old, though the females attain it sooner." according to mr. cupples' experience, male dogs go on growing in stature till they are from twelve to eighteen months old, and in weight till from eighteen to twenty-four months old; whilst the females cease increasing in stature at the age of from nine to fourteen or fifteen months, and in weight at the age of from twelve to fifteen months. from these various statements it is clear that the full difference in size between the male and female scotch deer-hound is not acquired until rather late in life. the males almost exclusively are used for coursing, for, as mr. mcneill informs me, the females have not sufficient strength and weight to pull down a full-grown deer. from the names used in old legends, it appears, as i hear from mr. cupples, that, at a very ancient period, the males were the most celebrated, the females being mentioned only as the mothers of famous dogs. hence, during many generations, it is the male which has been chiefly tested for strength, size, speed, and courage, and the best will have been bred from. as, however, the males do not attain their full dimensions until rather late in life, they will have tended, in accordance with the law often indicated, to transmit their characters to their male offspring alone; and thus the great inequality in size between the sexes of the scotch deer-hound may probably be accounted for. [fig. 65. head of common wild boar, in prime of life (from brehm).] the males of some few quadrupeds possess organs or parts developed solely as a means of defence against the attacks of other males. some kinds of deer use, as we have seen, the upper branches of their horns chiefly or exclusively for defending themselves; and the oryx antelope, as i am informed by mr. bartlett, fences most skilfully with his long, gently curved horns; but these are likewise used as organs of offence. the same observer remarks that rhinoceroses in fighting, parry each other's sidelong blows with their horns, which clatter loudly together, as do the tusks of boars. although wild boars fight desperately, they seldom, according to brehm, receive fatal wounds, as the blows fall on each other's tusks, or on the layer of gristly skin covering the shoulder, called by the german hunters, the shield; and here we have a part specially modified for defence. with boars in the prime of life (fig. 65) the tusks in the lower jaw are used for fighting, but they become in old age, as brehm states, so much curved inwards and upwards over the snout that they can no longer be used in this way. they may, however, still serve, and even more effectively, as a means of defence. in compensation for the loss of the lower tusks as weapons of offence, those in the upper jaw, which always project a little laterally, increase in old age so much in length and curve so much upwards that they can be used for attack. nevertheless, an old boar is not so dangerous to man as one at the age of six or seven years. (39. brehm, 'thierleben,' b. ii. ss. 729-732.) [fig. 66. skull of the babirusa pig (from wallace's 'malay archipelago').] in the full-grown male babirusa pig of celebes (fig. 66), the lower tusks are formidable weapons, like those of the european boar in the prime of life, whilst the upper tusks are so long and have their points so much curled inwards, sometimes even touching the forehead, that they are utterly useless as weapons of attack. they more nearly resemble horns than teeth, and are so manifestly useless as teeth that the animal was formerly supposed to rest his head by hooking them on to a branch! their convex surfaces, however, if the head were held a little laterally, would serve as an excellent guard; and hence, perhaps, it is that in old animals they "are generally broken off, as if by fighting." (40. see mr. wallace's interesting account of this animal, 'the malay archipelago,' 1869, vol. i. p. 435.) here, then, we have the curious case of the upper tusks of the babirusa regularly assuming during the prime of life a structure which apparently renders them fitted only for defence; whilst in the european boar the lower tusks assume in a less degree and only during old age nearly the same form, and then serve in like manner solely for defence. [fig. 67. head of female aethiopian wart-hog, from 'proc. zool. soc.' 1869, shewing the same characters as the male, though on a reduced scale. n.b. when the engraving was first made, i was under the impression that it represented the male.] in the wart-hog (see phacochoerus aethiopicus, fig. 67) the tusks in the upper jaw of the male curve upwards during the prime of life, and from being pointed serve as formidable weapons. the tusks in the lower jaw are sharper than those in the upper, but from their shortness it seems hardly possible that they can be used as weapons of attack. they must, however, greatly strengthen those in the upper jaw, from being ground so as to fit closely against their bases. neither the upper nor the lower tusks appear to have been specially modified to act as guards, though no doubt they are to a certain extent used for this purpose. but the wart-hog is not destitute of other special means of protection, for it has, on each side of the face, beneath the eyes, a rather stiff, yet flexible, cartilaginous, oblong pad (fig. 67), which projects two or three inches outwards; and it appeared to mr. bartlett and myself, when viewing the living animal, that these pads, when struck from beneath by the tusks of an opponent, would be turned upwards, and would thus admirably protect the somewhat prominent eyes. i may add, on the authority of mr. bartlett, that these boars when fighting stand directly face to face. lastly, the african river-hog (potomochoerus penicillatus) has a hard cartilaginous knob on each side of the face beneath the eyes, which answers to the flexible pad of the wart-hog; it has also two bony prominences on the upper jaw above the nostrils. a boar of this species in the zoological gardens recently broke into the cage of the wart-hog. they fought all night long, and were found in the morning much exhausted, but not seriously wounded. it is a significant fact, as shewing the purposes of the above- described projections and excrescences, that these were covered with blood, and were scored and abraded in an extraordinary manner. although the males of so many members of the pig family are provided with weapons, and as we have just seen with means of defence, these weapons seem to have been acquired within a rather late geological period. dr. forsyth major specifies (41. 'atti della soc. italiana di sc. nat.' 1873, vol. xv. fasc. iv.) several miocene species, in none of which do the tusks appear to have been largely developed in the males; and professor rutimeyer was formerly struck with this same fact. the mane of the lion forms a good defence against the attacks of rival lions, the one danger to which he is liable; for the males, as sir a. smith informs me, engage in terrible battles, and a young lion dares not approach an old one. in 1857 a tiger at bromwich broke into the cage of a lion and a fearful scene ensued: "the lion's mane saved his neck and head from being much injured, but the tiger at last succeeded in ripping up his belly, and in a few minutes he was dead." (42. 'the times,' nov. 10, 1857. in regard to the canada lynx, see audubon and bachman, 'quadrupeds of north america,' 1846, p. 139.) the broad ruff round the throat and chin of the canadian lynx (felis canadensis) is much longer in the male than in the female; but whether it serves as a defence i do not know. male seals are well known to fight desperately together, and the males of certain kinds (otaria jubata) (43. dr. murie, on otaria, 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1869, p. 109. mr. j.a. allen, in the paper above quoted (p. 75), doubts whether the hair, which is longer on the neck in the male than in the female, deserves to be called a mane.) have great manes, whilst the females have small ones or none. the male baboon of the cape of good hope (cynocephalus porcarius) has a much longer mane and larger canine teeth than the female; and the mane probably serves as a protection, for, on asking the keepers in the zoological gardens, without giving them any clue to my object, whether any of the monkeys especially attacked each other by the nape of the neck, i was answered that this was not the case, except with the above baboon. in the hamadryas baboon, ehrenberg compares the mane of the adult male to that of a young lion, whilst in the young of both sexes and in the female the mane is almost absent. it appeared to me probable that the immense woolly mane of the male american bison, which reaches almost to the ground, and is much more developed in the males than in the females, served as a protection to them in their terrible battles; but an experienced hunter told judge caton that he had never observed anything which favoured this belief. the stallion has a thicker and fuller mane than the mare; and i have made particular inquiries of two great trainers and breeders, who have had charge of many entire horses, and am assured that they "invariably endeavour to seize one another by the neck." it does not, however, follow from the foregoing statements, that when the hair on the neck serves as a defence, that it was originally developed for this purpose, though this is probable in some cases, as in that of the lion. i am informed by mr. mcneill that the long hairs on the throat of the stag (cervus elaphus) serve as a great protection to him when hunted, for the dogs generally endeavour to seize him by the throat; but it is not probable that these hairs were specially developed for this purpose; otherwise the young and the females would have been equally protected. choice in pairing by either sex of quadrupeds. before describing in the next chapter, the differences between the sexes in voice, odours emitted, and ornaments, it will be convenient here to consider whether the sexes exert any choice in their unions. does the female prefer any particular male, either before or after the males may have fought together for supremacy; or does the male, when not a polygamist, select any particular female? the general impression amongst breeders seems to be that the male accepts any female; and this owing to his eagerness, is, in most cases, probably the truth. whether the female as a general rule indifferently accepts any male is much more doubtful. in the fourteenth chapter, on birds, a considerable body of direct and indirect evidence was advanced, shewing that the female selects her partner; and it would be a strange anomaly if female quadrupeds, which stand higher in the scale and have higher mental powers, did not generally, or at least often, exert some choice. the female could in most cases escape, if wooed by a male that did not please or excite her; and when pursued by several males, as commonly occurs, she would often have the opportunity, whilst they were fighting together, of escaping with some one male, or at least of temporarily pairing with him. this latter contingency has often been observed in scotland with female red-deer, as i am informed by sir philip egerton and others. (44. mr. boner, in his excellent description of the habits of the red-deer in germany ('forest creatures,' 1861, p. 81) says, "while the stag is defending his rights against one intruder, another invades the sanctuary of his harem, and carries off trophy after trophy." exactly the same thing occurs with seals; see mr. j.a. allen, ibid. p. 100.) it is scarcely possible that much should be known about female quadrupeds in a state of nature making any choice in their marriage unions. the following curious details on the courtship of one of the eared seals (callorhinus ursinus) are given (45. mr. j.a. allen in 'bull. mus. comp. zoolog. of cambridge, united states,' vol. ii. no. 1, p. 99.) on the authority of capt. bryant, who had ample opportunities for observation. he says, "many of the females on their arrival at the island where they breed appear desirous of returning to some particular male, and frequently climb the outlying rocks to overlook the rookeries, calling out and listening as if for a familiar voice. then changing to another place they do the same again...as soon as a female reaches the shore, the nearest male goes down to meet her, making meanwhile a noise like the clucking of a hen to her chickens. he bows to her and coaxes her until he gets between her and the water so that she cannot escape him. then his manner changes, and with a harsh growl he drives her to a place in his harem. this continues until the lower row of harems is nearly full. then the males higher up select the time when their more fortunate neighbours are off their guard to steal their wives. this they do by taking them in their mouths and lifting them over the heads of the other females, and carefully placing them in their own harem, carrying them as cats do their kittens. those still higher up pursue the same method until the whole space is occupied. frequently a struggle ensues between two males for the possession of the same female, and both seizing her at once pull her in two or terribly lacerate her with their teeth. when the space is all filled, the old male walks around complacently reviewing his family, scolding those who crowd or disturb the others, and fiercely driving off all intruders. this surveillance always keeps him actively occupied." as so little is known about the courtship of animals in a state of nature, i have endeavoured to discover how far our domesticated quadrupeds evince any choice in their unions. dogs offer the best opportunity for observation, as they are carefully attended to and well understood. many breeders have expressed a strong opinion on this head. thus, mr. mayhew remarks, "the females are able to bestow their affections; and tender recollections are as potent over them as they are known to be in other cases, where higher animals are concerned. bitches are not always prudent in their loves, but are apt to fling themselves away on curs of low degree. if reared with a companion of vulgar appearance, there often springs up between the pair a devotion which no time can afterwards subdue. the passion, for such it really is, becomes of a more than romantic endurance." mr. mayhew, who attended chiefly to the smaller breeds, is convinced that the females are strongly attracted by males of a large size. (46. 'dogs: their management,' by e. mayhew, m.r.c.v.s., 2nd ed., 1864, pp. 187-192.) the well-known veterinary blaine states (47. quoted by alex. walker, 'on intermarriage,' 1838, p. 276; see also p. 244.) that his own female pug dog became so attached to a spaniel, and a female setter to a cur, that in neither case would they pair with a dog of their own breed until several weeks had elapsed. two similar and trustworthy accounts have been given me in regard to a female retriever and a spaniel, both of which became enamoured with terrier-dogs. mr. cupples informs me that he can personally vouch for the accuracy of the following more remarkable case, in which a valuable and wonderfully- intelligent female terrier loved a retriever belonging to a neighbour to such a degree, that she had often to be dragged away from him. after their permanent separation, although repeatedly shewing milk in her teats, she would never acknowledge the courtship of any other dog, and to the regret of her owner never bore puppies. mr. cupples also states, that in 1868, a female deerhound in his kennel thrice produced puppies, and on each occasion shewed a marked preference for one of the largest and handsomest, but not the most eager, of four deerhounds living with her, all in the prime of life. mr. cupples has observed that the female generally favours a dog whom she has associated with and knows; her shyness and timidity at first incline her against a strange dog. the male, on the contrary, seems rather inclined towards strange females. it appears to be rare when the male refuses any particular female, but mr. wright, of yeldersley house, a great breeder of dogs, informs me that he has known some instances; he cites the case of one of his own deerhounds, who would not take any notice of a particular female mastiff, so that another deerhound had to be employed. it would be superfluous to give, as i could, other instances, and i will only add that mr. barr, who has carefully bred many bloodhounds, states that in almost every instance particular individuals of opposite sexes shew a decided preference for each other. finally, mr. cupples, after attending to this subject for another year, has written to me, "i have had full confirmation of my former statement, that dogs in breeding form decided preferences for each other, being often influenced by size, bright colour, and individual characters, as well as by the degree of their previous familiarity." in regard to horses, mr. blenkiron, the greatest breeder of race-horses in the world, informs me that stallions are so frequently capricious in their choice, rejecting one mare and without any apparent cause taking to another, that various artifices have to be habitually used. the famous monarque, for instance, would never consciously look at the dam of gladiateur, and a trick had to be practised. we can partly see the reason why valuable race-horse stallions, which are in such demand as to be exhausted, should be so particular in their choice. mr. blenkiron has never known a mare reject a horse; but this has occurred in mr. wright's stable, so that the mare had to be cheated. prosper lucas (48. 'traité de l'héréd. nat.' tom. ii. 1850, p. 296.) quotes various statements from french authorities, and remarks, "on voit des étalons qui s'eprennent d'une jument, et negligent toutes les autres." he gives, on the authority of baelen, similar facts in regard to bulls; and mr. h. reeks assures me that a famous short-horn bull belonging to his father "invariably refused to be matched with a black cow." hoffberg, in describing the domesticated reindeer of lapland says, "foeminae majores et fortiores mares prae caeteris admittunt, ad eos confugiunt, a junioribus agitatae, qui hos in fugam conjiciunt." (49. 'amoenitates acad.' vol. iv. 1788, p. 160.) a clergyman, who has bred many pigs, asserts that sows often reject one boar and immediately accept another. from these facts there can be no doubt that, with most of our domesticated quadrupeds, strong individual antipathies and preferences are frequently exhibited, and much more commonly by the female than by the male. this being the case, it is improbable that the unions of quadrupeds in a state of nature should be left to mere chance. it is much more probable that the females are allured or excited by particular males, who possess certain characters in a higher degree than other males; but what these characters are, we can seldom or never discover with certainty. chapter xviii. secondary sexual characters of mammals--continued. voice--remarkable sexual peculiarities in seals--odour--development of the hair--colour of the hair and skin--anomalous case of the female being more ornamented than the male--colour and ornaments due to sexual selection-- colour acquired for the sake of protection--colour, though common to both sexes, often due to sexual selection--on the disappearance of spots and stripes in adult quadrupeds--on the colours and ornaments of the quadrumana--summary. quadrupeds use their voices for various purposes, as a signal of danger, as a call from one member of a troop to another, or from the mother to her lost offspring, or from the latter for protection to their mother; but such uses need not here be considered. we are concerned only with the difference between the voices of the sexes, for instance between that of the lion and lioness, or of the bull and cow. almost all male animals use their voices much more during the rutting-season than at any other time; and some, as the giraffe and porcupine (1. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 585.), are said to be completely mute excepting at this season. as the throats (i.e. the larynx and thyroid bodies (2. ibid. p. 595.)) of stags periodically become enlarged at the beginning of the breeding-season, it might be thought that their powerful voices must be somehow of high importance to them; but this is very doubtful. from information given to me by two experienced observers, mr. mcneill and sir p. egerton, it seems that young stags under three years old do not roar or bellow; and that the old ones begin bellowing at the commencement of the breeding-season, at first only occasionally and moderately, whilst they restlessly wander about in search of the females. their battles are prefaced by loud and prolonged bellowing, but during the actual conflict they are silent. animals of all kinds which habitually use their voices utter various noises under any strong emotion, as when enraged and preparing to fight; but this may merely be the result of nervous excitement, which leads to the spasmodic contraction of almost all the muscles of the body, as when a man grinds his teeth and clenches his fists in rage or agony. no doubt stags challenge each other to mortal combat by bellowing; but those with the more powerful voices, unless at the same time the stronger, better-armed, and more courageous, would not gain any advantage over their rivals. it is possible that the roaring of the lion may be of some service to him by striking terror into his adversary; for when enraged he likewise erects his mane and thus instinctively tries to make himself appear as terrible as possible. but it can hardly be supposed that the bellowing of the stag, even if it be of service to him in this way, can have been important enough to have led to the periodical enlargement of the throat. some writers suggest that the bellowing serves as a call to the female; but the experienced observers above quoted inform me that female deer do not search for the male, though the males search eagerly for the females, as indeed might be expected from what we know of the habits of other male quadrupeds. the voice of the female, on the other hand, quickly brings to her one or more stags (3. see, for instance, major w. ross king ('the sportsman in canada,' 1866, pp. 53, 131) on the habits of the moose and wild reindeer.), as is well known to the hunters who in wild countries imitate her cry. if we could believe that the male had the power to excite or allure the female by his voice, the periodical enlargement of his vocal organs would be intelligible on the principle of sexual selection, together with inheritance limited to the same sex and season; but we have no evidence in favour of this view. as the case stands, the loud voice of the stag during the breeding-season does not seem to be of any special service to him, either during his courtship or battles, or in any other way. but may we not believe that the frequent use of the voice, under the strong excitement of love, jealousy, and rage, continued during many generations, may at last have produced an inherited effect on the vocal organs of the stag, as well as of other male animals? this appears to me, in our present state of knowledge, the most probable view. the voice of the adult male gorilla is tremendous, and he is furnished with a laryngeal sack, as is the adult male orang. (4. owen 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 600.) the gibbons rank among the noisiest of monkeys, and the sumatra species (hylobates syndactylus) is also furnished with an air sack; but mr. blyth, who has had opportunities for observation, does not believe that the male is noisier than the female. hence, these latter monkeys probably use their voices as a mutual call; and this is certainly the case with some quadrupeds, for instance the beaver. (5. mr. green, in 'journal of linnean society,' vol. x. 'zoology,' 1869, note 362.) another gibbon, the h. agilis, is remarkable, from having the power of giving a complete and correct octave of musical notes (6. c.l. martin, 'general introduction to the natural history of mamm. animals,' 1841, p. 431.), which we may reasonably suspect serves as a sexual charm; but i shall have to recur to this subject in the next chapter. the vocal organs of the american mycetes caraya are one-third larger in the male than in the female, and are wonderfully powerful. these monkeys in warm weather make the forests resound at morning and evening with their overwhelming voices. the males begin the dreadful concert, and often continue it during many hours, the females sometimes joining in with their less powerful voices. an excellent observer, rengger (7. 'naturgeschichte der säugethiere von paraguay,' 1830, ss. 15, 21.), could not perceive that they were excited to begin by any special cause; he thinks that, like many birds, they delight in their own music, and try to excel each other. whether most of the foregoing monkeys have acquired their powerful voices in order to beat their rivals and charm the females--or whether the vocal organs have been strengthened and enlarged through the inherited effects of long-continued use without any particular good being thus gained--i will not pretend to say; but the former view, at least in the case of the hylobates agilis, seems the most probable. i may here mention two very curious sexual peculiarities occurring in seals, because they have been supposed by some writers to affect the voice. the nose of the male sea-elephant (macrorhinus proboscideus) becomes greatly elongated during the breeding-season, and can then be erected. in this state it is sometimes a foot in length. the female is not thus provided at any period of life. the male makes a wild, hoarse, gurgling noise, which is audible at a great distance and is believed to be strengthened by the proboscis; the voice of the female being different. lesson compares the erection of the proboscis, with the swelling of the wattles of male gallinaceous birds whilst courting the females. in another allied kind of seal, the bladder-nose (cystophora cristata), the head is covered by a great hood or bladder. this is supported by the septum of the nose, which is produced far backwards and rises into an internal crest seven inches in height. the hood is clothed with short hair, and is muscular; can be inflated until it more than equals the whole head in size! the males when rutting, fight furiously on the ice, and their roaring "is said to be sometimes so loud as to be heard four miles off." when attacked they likewise roar or bellow; and whenever irritated the bladder is inflated and quivers. some naturalists believe that the voice is thus strengthened, but various other uses have been assigned to this extraordinary structure. mr. r. brown thinks that it serves as a protection against accidents of all kinds; but this is not probable, for, as i am assured by mr. lamont who killed 600 of these animals, the hood is rudimentary in the females, and it is not developed in the males during youth. (8. on the sea-elephant, see an article by lesson, in 'dict. class. hist. nat.' tom. xiii. p. 418. for the cystophora, or stemmatopus, see dr. dekay, 'annals of lyceum of nat. hist.' new york, vol. i. 1824, p. 94. pennant has also collected information from the sealers on this animal. the fullest account is given by mr. brown, in 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1868, p. 435.) odour. with some animals, as with the notorious skunk of america, the overwhelming odour which they emit appears to serve exclusively as a defence. with shrew-mice (sorex) both sexes possess abdominal scent-glands, and there can be little doubt, from the rejection of their bodies by birds and beasts of prey, that the odour is protective; nevertheless, the glands become enlarged in the males during the breeding-season. in many other quadrupeds the glands are of the same size in both sexes (9. as with the castoreum of the beaver, see mr. l.h. morgan's most interesting work, 'the american beaver,' 1868, p. 300. pallas ('spic. zoolog.' fasc. viii. 1779, p. 23) has well discussed the odoriferous glands of mammals. owen ('anat. of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 634) also gives an account of these glands, including those of the elephant, and (p. 763) those of shrew-mice. on bats, mr. dobson in 'proceedings of the zoological society' 1873, p. 241.), but their uses are not known. in other species the glands are confined to the males, or are more developed than in the females; and they almost always become more active during the rutting-season. at this period the glands on the sides of the face of the male elephant enlarge, and emit a secretion having a strong musky odour. the males, and rarely the females, of many kinds of bats have glands and protrudable sacks situated in various parts; and it is believed that these are odoriferous. the rank effluvium of the male goat is well known, and that of certain male deer is wonderfully strong and persistent. on the banks of the plata i perceived the air tainted with the odour of the male cervus campestris, at half a mile to leeward of a herd; and a silk handkerchief, in which i carried home a skin, though often used and washed, retained, when first unfolded, traces of the odour for one year and seven months. this animal does not emit its strong odour until more than a year old, and if castrated whilst young never emits it. (10. rengger, 'naturgeschichte der säugethiere von paraguay,' 1830, s. 355. this observer also gives some curious particulars in regard to the odour.) besides the general odour, permeating the whole body of certain ruminants (for instance, bos moschatus) in the breeding-season, many deer, antelopes, sheep, and goats possess odoriferous glands in various situations, more especially on their faces. the so-called tear-sacks, or suborbital pits, come under this head. these glands secrete a semi-fluid fetid matter which is sometimes so copious as to stain the whole face, as i have myself seen in an antelope. they are "usually larger in the male than in the female, and their development is checked by castration." (11. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 632. see also dr. murie's observations on those glands in the 'proc. zoolog. soc.' 1870, p. 340. desmarest, 'on the antilope subgutturosa, 'mammalogie,' 1820, p. 455.) according to desmarest they are altogether absent in the female of antilope subgutturosa. hence, there can be no doubt that they stand in close relation with the reproductive functions. they are also sometimes present, and sometimes absent, in nearly allied forms. in the adult male musk-deer (moschus moschiferus), a naked space round the tail is bedewed with an odoriferous fluid, whilst in the adult female, and in the male until two years old, this space is covered with hair and is not odoriferous. the proper musk- sack of this deer is from its position necessarily confined to the male, and forms an additional scent-organ. it is a singular fact that the matter secreted by this latter gland, does not, according to pallas, change in consistence, or increase in quantity, during the rutting-season; nevertheless this naturalist admits that its presence is in some way connected with the act of reproduction. he gives, however, only a conjectural and unsatisfactory explanation of its use. (12. pallas, 'spicilegia zoolog.' fasc. xiii. 1799, p. 24; desmoulins, 'dict. class. d'hist. nat.' tom. iii. p. 586.) in most cases, when only the male emits a strong odour during the breeding- season, it probably serves to excite or allure the female. we must not judge on this head by our own taste, for it is well known that rats are enticed by certain essential oils, and cats by valerian, substances far from agreeable to us; and that dogs, though they will not eat carrion, sniff and roll on it. from the reasons given when discussing the voice of the stag, we may reject the idea that the odour serves to bring the females from a distance to the males. active and long-continued use cannot here have come into play, as in the case of the vocal organs. the odour emitted must be of considerable importance to the male, inasmuch as large and complex glands, furnished with muscles for everting the sack, and for closing or opening the orifice, have in some cases been developed. the development of these organs is intelligible through sexual selection, if the most odoriferous males are the most successful in winning the females, and in leaving offspring to inherit their gradually perfected glands and odours. development of the hair. we have seen that male quadrupeds often have the hair on their necks and shoulders much more developed than the females; and many additional instances could be given. this sometimes serves as a defence to the male during his battles; but whether the hair in most cases has been specially developed for this purpose, is very doubtful. we may feel almost certain that this is not the case, when only a thin and narrow crest runs along the back; for a crest of this kind would afford scarcely any protection, and the ridge of the back is not a place likely to be injured; nevertheless such crests are sometimes confined to the males, or are much more developed in them than in the females. two antelopes, the tragelaphus scriptus (13. dr. gray, 'gleanings from the menagerie at knowsley,' pl. 28.) (fig. 70) and portax picta may be given as instances. when stags, and the males of the wild goat, are enraged or terrified, these crests stand erect (14. judge caton on the wapiti, 'transact. ottawa acad. nat. sciences,' 1868, pp. 36, 40; blyth, 'land and water,' on capra aegagrus 1867, p. 37.); but it cannot be supposed that they have been developed merely for the sake of exciting fear in their enemies. one of the above-named antelopes, the portax picta, has a large well-defined brush of black hair on the throat, and this is much larger in the male than in the female. in the ammotragus tragelaphus of north africa, a member of the sheep-family, the fore-legs are almost concealed by an extraordinary growth of hair, which depends from the neck and upper halves of the legs; but mr. bartlett does not believe that this mantle is of the least use to the male, in whom it is much more developed than in the female. [fig. 68. pithecia satanas, male (from brehm).] male quadrupeds of many kinds differ from the females in having more hair, or hair of a different character, on certain parts of their faces. thus the bull alone has curled hair on the forehead. (15. hunter's 'essays and observations,' edited by owen, 1861. vol. i. p. 236.) in three closely- allied sub-genera of the goat family, only the males possess beards, sometimes of large size; in two other sub-genera both sexes have a beard, but it disappears in some of the domestic breeds of the common goat; and neither sex of the hemitragus has a beard. in the ibex the beard is not developed during the summer, and is so small at other times that it may be called rudimentary. (16. see dr. gray's 'catalogue of mammalia in the british museum,' part iii. 1852, p. 144.) with some monkeys the beard is confined to the male, as in the orang; or is much larger in the male than in the female, as in the mycetes caraya and pithecia satanas (fig. 68). so it is with the whiskers of some species of macacus (17. rengger, 'säugethiere,' etc., s. 14; desmarest, 'mammalogie,' p. 86.), and, as we have seen, with the manes of some species of baboons. but with most kinds of monkeys the various tufts of hair about the face and head are alike in both sexes. the males of various members of the ox family (bovidae), and of certain antelopes, are furnished with a dewlap, or great fold of skin on the neck, which is much less developed in the female. now, what must we conclude with respect to such sexual differences as these? no one will pretend that the beards of certain male goats, or the dewlaps of the bull, or the crests of hair along the backs of certain male antelopes, are of any use to them in their ordinary habits. it is possible that the immense beard of the male pithecia, and the large beard of the male orang, may protect their throats when fighting; for the keepers in the zoological gardens inform me that many monkeys attack each other by the throat; but it is not probable that the beard has been developed for a distinct purpose from that served by the whiskers, moustache, and other tufts of hair on the face; and no one will suppose that these are useful as a protection. must we attribute all these appendages of hair or skin to mere purposeless variability in the male? it cannot be denied that this is possible; for in many domesticated quadrupeds, certain characters, apparently not derived through reversion from any wild parent form, are confined to the males, or are more developed in them than in the females-- for instance, the hump on the male zebu-cattle of india, the tail of fat- tailed rams, the arched outline of the forehead in the males of several breeds of sheep, and lastly, the mane, the long hairs on the hind legs, and the dewlap of the male of the berbura goat. (18. see the chapters on these several animals in vol. i. of my 'variation of animals under domestication;' also vol. ii. p. 73; also chap. xx. on the practice of selection by semi-civilised people. for the berbura goat, see dr. gray, 'catalogue,' ibid. p. 157.) the mane, which occurs only in the rams of an african breed of sheep, is a true secondary sexual character, for, as i hear from mr. winwood reade, it is not developed if the animal be castrated. although we ought to be extremely cautious, as shewn in my work on 'variation under domestication,' in concluding that any character, even with animals kept by semi-civilised people, has not been subjected to selection by man, and thus augmented, yet in the cases just specified this is improbable; more especially as the characters are confined to the males, or are more strongly developed in them than in the females. if it were positively known that the above african ram is a descendant of the same primitive stock as the other breeds of sheep, and if the berbura male-goat with his mane, dewlap, etc., is descended from the same stock as other goats, then, assuming that selection has not been applied to these characters, they must be due to simple variability, together with sexually- limited inheritance. hence it appears reasonable to extend this same view to all analogous cases with animals in a state of nature. nevertheless i cannot persuade myself that it generally holds good, as in the case of the extraordinary development of hair on the throat and fore-legs of the male ammotragus, or in that of the immense beard of the male pithecia. such study as i have been able to give to nature makes me believe that parts or organs which are highly developed, were acquired at some period for a special purpose. with those antelopes in which the adult male is more strongly-coloured than the female, and with those monkeys in which the hair on the face is elegantly arranged and coloured in a diversified manner, it seems probable that the crests and tufts of hair were gained as ornaments; and this i know is the opinion of some naturalists. if this be correct, there can be little doubt that they were gained or at least modified through sexual selection; but how far the same view may be extended to other mammals is doubtful. colour of the hair and of the naked skin. i will first give briefly all the cases known to me of male quadrupeds differing in colour from the females. with marsupials, as i am informed by mr. gould, the sexes rarely differ in this respect; but the great red kangaroo offers a striking exception, "delicate blue being the prevailing tint in those parts of the female which in the male are red." (19. osphranter rufus, gould, 'mammals of australia,' 1863, vol. ii. on the didelphis, desmarest, 'mammalogie,' p. 256.) in the didelphis opossum of cayenne the female is said to be a little more red than the male. of the rodents, dr. gray remarks: "african squirrels, especially those found in the tropical regions, have the fur much brighter and more vivid at some seasons of the year than at others, and the fur of the male is generally brighter than that of the female." (20. 'annals and magazine of natural history,' nov. 1867, p. 325. on the mus minutus, desmarest, 'mammalogie,' p. 304.) dr. gray informs me that he specified the african squirrels, because, from their unusually bright colours, they best exhibit this difference. the female of the mus minutus of russia is of a paler and dirtier tint than the male. in a large number of bats the fur of the male is lighter than in the female. (21. j.a. allen, in 'bulletin of mus. comp. zoolog. of cambridge, united states,' 1869, p. 207. mr. dobson on sexual characters in the chiroptera, 'proceedings of the zoological society,' 1873, p. 241. dr. gray on sloths, ibid. 1871, p. 436.) mr. dobson also remarks, with respect to these animals: "differences, depending partly or entirely on the possession by the male of fur of a much more brilliant hue, or distinguished by different markings or by the greater length of certain portions, are met only, to any appreciable extent, in the frugivorous bats in which the sense of sight is well developed." this last remark deserves attention, as bearing on the question whether bright colours are serviceable to male animals from being ornamental. in one genus of sloths, it is now established, as dr. gray states, "that the males are ornamented differently from the females--that is to say, that they have a patch of soft short hair between the shoulders, which is generally of a more or less orange colour, and in one species pure white. the females, on the contrary, are destitute of this mark." the terrestrial carnivora and insectivora rarely exhibit sexual differences of any kind, including colour. the ocelot (felis pardalis), however, is exceptional, for the colours of the female, compared with those of the male, are "moins apparentes, le fauve, étant plus terne, le blanc moins pur, les raies ayant moins de largeur et les taches moins de diamètre." (22. desmarest, 'mammalogie,' 1820, p. 220. on felis mitis, rengger, ibid. s. 194.) the sexes of the allied felis mitis also differ, but in a less degree; the general hues of the female being rather paler than in the male, with the spots less black. the marine carnivora or seals, on the other hand, sometimes differ considerably in colour, and they present, as we have already seen, other remarkable sexual differences. thus the male of the otaria nigrescens of the southern hemisphere is of a rich brown shade above; whilst the female, who acquires her adult tints earlier in life than the male, is dark-grey above, the young of both sexes being of a deep chocolate colour. the male of the northern phoca groenlandica is tawny grey, with a curious saddle-shaped dark mark on the back; the female is much smaller, and has a very different appearance, being "dull white or yellowish straw-colour, with a tawny hue on the back"; the young at first are pure white, and can "hardly be distinguished among the icy hummocks and snow, their colour thus acting as a protection." (23. dr. murie on the otaria, 'proceedings zoological society,' 1869, p. 108. mr. r. brown on the p. groenlandica, ibid. 1868, p. 417. see also on the colours of seals, desmarest, ibid. pp. 243, 249.) with ruminants sexual differences of colour occur more commonly than in any other order. a difference of this kind is general in the strepsicerene antelopes; thus the male nilghau (portax picta) is bluish-grey and much darker than the female, with the square white patch on the throat, the white marks on the fetlocks, and the black spots on the ears all much more distinct. we have seen that in this species the crests and tufts of hair are likewise more developed in the male than in the hornless female. i am informed by mr. blyth that the male, without shedding his hair, periodically becomes darker during the breeding-season. young males cannot be distinguished from young females until about twelve months old; and if the male is emasculated before this period, he never, according to the same authority, changes colour. the importance of this latter fact, as evidence that the colouring of the portax is of sexual origin, becomes obvious, when we hear (24. judge caton, in 'transactions of the ottawa academy of natural sciences,' 1868, p. 4.) that neither the red summer-coat nor the blue winter-coat of the virginian deer is at all affected by emasculation. with most or all of the highly-ornamented species of tragelaphus the males are darker than the hornless females, and their crests of hair are more fully developed. in the male of that magnificent antelope, the derbyan eland, the body is redder, the whole neck much blacker, and the white band which separates these colours broader than in the female. in the cape eland, also, the male is slightly darker than the female. (25. dr. gray, 'cat. of mamm. in brit. mus.' part iii. 1852, pp. 134-142; also dr. gray, 'gleanings from the menagerie of knowsley,' in which there is a splendid drawing of the oreas derbianus: see the text on tragelaphus. for the cape eland (oreas canna), see andrew smith, 'zoology of s. africa,' pl. 41 and 42. there are also many of these antelopes in the zoological gardens.) in the indian black-buck (a. bezoartica), which belongs to another tribe of antelopes, the male is very dark, almost black; whilst the hornless female is fawn-coloured. we meet in this species, as mr. blyth informs me, with an exactly similar series of facts, as in the portax picta, namely, in the male periodically changing colour during the breeding-season, in the effects of emasculation on this change, and in the young of both sexes being indistinguishable from each other. in the antilope niger the male is black, the female, as well as the young of both sexes, being brown; in a. sing-sing the male is much brighter coloured than the hornless female, and his chest and belly are blacker; in the male a. caama, the marks and lines which occur on various parts of the body are black, instead of brown as in the female; in the brindled gnu (a. gorgon) "the colours of the male are nearly the same as those of the female, only deeper and of a brighter hue." (26. on the ant. niger, see 'proc. zool. soc.' 1850, p. 133. with respect to an allied species, in which there is an equal sexual difference in colour, see sir s. baker, 'the albert nyanza,' 1866, vol. ii. p. 627. for the a. sing-sing, gray, 'cat. b. mus.' p. 100. desmarest, 'mammalogie,' p. 468, on the a. caama. andrew smith, 'zoology of s. africa,' on the gnu.) other analogous cases could be added. the banteng bull (bos sondaicus) of the malayan archipelago is almost black, with white legs and buttocks; the cow is of a bright dun, as are the young males until about the age of three years, when they rapidly change colour. the emasculated bull reverts to the colour of the female. the female kemas goat is paler, and both it and the female capra aegagrus are said to be more uniformly tinted than their males. deer rarely present any sexual differences in colour. judge caton, however, informs me that in the males of the wapiti deer (cervus canadensis) the neck, belly, and legs are much darker than in the female; but during the winter the darker tints gradually fade away and disappear. i may here mention that judge caton has in his park three races of the virginian deer, which differ slightly in colour, but the differences are almost exclusively confined to the blue winter or breeding-coat; so that this case may be compared with those given in a previous chapter of closely-allied or representative species of birds, which differ from each other only in their breeding plumage. (27. 'ottawa academy of sciences,' may 21, 1868, pp. 3, 5.) the females of cervus paludosus of s. america, as well as the young of both sexes, do not possess the black stripes on the nose and the blackish-brown line on the breast, which are characteristic of the adult males. (28. s. muller, on the banteng, 'zoog. indischen archipel.' 1839-1844, tab. 35; see also raffles, as quoted by mr. blyth, in 'land and water,' 1867, p. 476. on goats, dr. gray, 'catalogue of the british museum,' p. 146; desmarest, 'mammalogie,' p. 482. on the cervus paludosus, rengger, ibid. s. 345.) lastly, as i am informed by mr. blyth, the mature male of the beautifully coloured and spotted axis deer is considerably darker than the female: and this hue the castrated male never acquires. the last order which we need consider is that of the primates. the male of the lemur macaco is generally coal-black, whilst the female is brown. (29. sclater, 'proc. zool. soc.' 1866, p. i. the same fact has also been fully ascertained by mm. pollen and van dam. see, also, dr. gray in 'annals and magazine of natural history,' may 1871, p. 340.) of the quadrumana of the new world, the females and young of mycetes caraya are greyish-yellow and like each other; in the second year the young male becomes reddish-brown; in the third, black, excepting the stomach, which, however, becomes quite black in the fourth or fifth year. there is also a strongly-marked difference in colour between the sexes of mycetes seniculus and cebus capucinus; the young of the former, and i believe of the latter species, resembling the females. with pithecia leucocephala the young likewise resemble the females, which are brownish-black above and light rusty-red beneath, the adult males being black. the ruff of hair round the face of ateles marginatus is tinted yellow in the male and white in the female. turning to the old world, the males of hylobates hoolock are always black, with the exception of a white band over the brows; the females vary from whity-brown to a dark tint mixed with black, but are never wholly black. (30. on mycetes, rengger, ibid. s. 14; and brehm, 'thierleben,' b. i. s. 96, 107. on ateles desmarest, 'mammalogie,' p. 75. on hylobates, blyth, 'land and water,' 1867, p. 135. on the semnopithecus, s. muller, 'zoog. indischen archipel.' tab. x.) in the beautiful cercopithecus diana, the head of the adult male is of an intense black, whilst that of the female is dark grey; in the former the fur between the thighs is of an elegant fawn- colour, in the latter it is paler. in the beautiful and curious moustache monkey (cercopithecus cephus) the only difference between the sexes is that the tail of the male is chestnut and that of the female grey; but mr. bartlett informs me that all the hues become more pronounced in the male when adult, whilst in the female they remain as they were during youth. according to the coloured figures given by solomon muller, the male of semnopithecus chrysomelas is nearly black, the female being pale brown. in the cercopithecus cynosurus and griseo-viridis one part of the body, which is confined to the male sex, is of the most brilliant blue or green, and contrasts strikingly with the naked skin on the hinder part of the body, which is vivid red. [fig. 69. head of male mandrill (from gervais, 'hist. nat. des mammifères').] lastly, in the baboon family, the adult male of cynocephalus hamadryas differs from the female not only by his immense mane, but slightly in the colour of the hair and of the naked callosities. in the drill (c. leucophaeus) the females and young are much paler-coloured, with less green, than the adult males. no other member in the whole class of mammals is coloured in so extraordinary a manner as the adult male mandrill (c. mormon). the face at this age becomes of a fine blue, with the ridge and tip of the nose of the most brilliant red. according to some authors, the face is also marked with whitish stripes, and is shaded in parts with black, but the colours appear to be variable. on the forehead there is a crest of hair, and on the chin a yellow beard. "toutes les parties supérieures de leurs cuisses et le grand espace nu de leurs fesses sont également colorés du rouge le plus vif, avec un mélange de bleu qui ne manque reellement pas d'élégance." (31. gervais, 'hist. nat. des mammifères,' 1854, p. 103. figures are given of the skull of the male. also desmarest, 'mammalogie,' p. 70. geoffroy st.-hilaire and f. cuvier, 'hist. nat. des mammifères,' 1824, tom. i.) when the animal is excited all the naked parts become much more vividly tinted. several authors have used the strongest expressions in describing these resplendent colours, which they compare with those of the most brilliant birds. another remarkable peculiarity is that when the great canine teeth are fully developed, immense protuberances of bone are formed on each cheek, which are deeply furrowed longitudinally, and the naked skin over them is brilliantly- coloured, as just-described. (fig. 69.) in the adult females and in the young of both sexes these protuberances are scarcely perceptible; and the naked parts are much less bright coloured, the face being almost black, tinged with blue. in the adult female, however, the nose at certain regular intervals of time becomes tinted with red. in all the cases hitherto given the male is more strongly or brighter coloured than the female, and differs from the young of both sexes. but as with some few birds it is the female which is brighter coloured than the male, so with the rhesus monkey (macacus rhesus), the female has a large surface of naked skin round the tail, of a brilliant carmine red, which, as i was assured by the keepers in the zoological gardens, periodically becomes even yet more vivid, and her face also is pale red. on the other hand, in the adult male and in the young of both sexes (as i saw in the gardens), neither the naked skin at the posterior end of the body, nor the face, shew a trace of red. it appears, however, from some published accounts, that the male does occasionally, or during certain seasons, exhibit some traces of the red. although he is thus less ornamented than the female, yet in the larger size of his body, larger canine teeth, more developed whiskers, more prominent superciliary ridges, he follows the common rule of the male excelling the female. i have now given all the cases known to me of a difference in colour between the sexes of mammals. some of these may be the result of variations confined to one sex and transmitted to the same sex, without any good being gained, and therefore without the aid of selection. we have instances of this with our domesticated animals, as in the males of certain cats being rusty-red, whilst the females are tortoise-shell coloured. analogous cases occur in nature: mr. bartlett has seen many black varieties of the jaguar, leopard, vulpine phalanger, and wombat; and he is certain that all, or nearly all these animals, were males. on the other hand, with wolves, foxes, and apparently american squirrels, both sexes are occasionally born black. hence it is quite possible that with some mammals a difference in colour between the sexes, especially when this is congenital, may simply be the result, without the aid of selection, of the occurrence of one or more variations, which from the first were sexually limited in their transmission. nevertheless it is improbable that the diversified, vivid, and contrasted colours of certain quadrupeds, for instance, of the above monkeys and antelopes, can thus be accounted for. we should bear in mind that these colours do not appear in the male at birth, but only at or near maturity; and that unlike ordinary variations, they are lost if the male be emasculated. it is on the whole probable that the strongly-marked colours and other ornamental characters of male quadrupeds are beneficial to them in their rivalry with other males, and have consequently been acquired through sexual selection. this view is strengthened by the differences in colour between the sexes occurring almost exclusively, as may be collected from the previous details, in those groups and sub-groups of mammals which present other and strongly-marked secondary sexual characters; these being likewise due to sexual selection. quadrupeds manifestly take notice of colour. sir s. baker repeatedly observed that the african elephant and rhinoceros attacked white or grey horses with special fury. i have elsewhere shewn (32. the 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' 1868, vol. ii. pp. 102, 103.) that half-wild horses apparently prefer to pair with those of the same colour, and that herds of fallow-deer of different colours, though living together, have long kept distinct. it is a more significant fact that a female zebra would not admit the addresses of a male ass until he was painted so as to resemble a zebra, and then, as john hunter remarks, "she received him very readily. in this curious fact, we have instinct excited by mere colour, which had so strong an effect as to get the better of everything else. but the male did not require this, the female being an animal somewhat similar to himself, was sufficient to rouse him." (33. 'essays and observations,' by j. hunter, edited by owen, 1861, vol. i. p. 194.) in an earlier chapter we have seen that the mental powers of the higher animals do not differ in kind, though greatly in degree, from the corresponding powers of man, especially of the lower and barbarous races; and it would appear that even their taste for the beautiful is not widely different from that of the quadrumana. as the negro of africa raises the flesh on his face into parallel ridges "or cicatrices, high above the natural surface, which unsightly deformities are considered great personal attractions" (34. sir s. baker, 'the nile tributaries of abyssinia,' 1867.);--as negroes and savages in many parts of the world paint their faces with red, blue, white, or black bars,--so the male mandrill of africa appears to have acquired his deeply-furrowed and gaudily-coloured face from having been thus rendered attractive to the female. no doubt it is to us a most grotesque notion that the posterior end of the body should be coloured for the sake of ornament even more brilliantly than the face; but this is not more strange than that the tails of many birds should be especially decorated. with mammals we do not at present possess any evidence that the males take pains to display their charms before the female; and the elaborate manner in which this is performed by male birds and other animals is the strongest argument in favour of the belief that the females admire, or are excited by, the ornaments and colours displayed before them. there is, however, a striking parallelism between mammals and birds in all their secondary sexual characters, namely in their weapons for fighting with rival males, in their ornamental appendages, and in their colours. in both classes, when the male differs from the female, the young of both sexes almost always resemble each other, and in a large majority of cases resemble the adult female. in both classes the male assumes the characters proper to his sex shortly before the age of reproduction; and if emasculated at an early period, loses them. in both classes the change of colour is sometimes seasonal, and the tints of the naked parts sometimes become more vivid during the act of courtship. in both classes the male is almost always more vividly or strongly coloured than the female, and is ornamented with larger crests of hair or feathers, or other such appendages. in a few exceptional cases the female in both classes is more highly ornamented than the male. with many mammals, and at least in the case of one bird, the male is more odoriferous than the female. in both classes the voice of the male is more powerful than that of the female. considering this parallelism, there can be little doubt that the same cause, whatever it may be, has acted on mammals and birds; and the result, as far as ornamental characters are concerned, may be attributed, as it appears to me, to the long-continued preference of the individuals of one sex for certain individuals of the opposite sex, combined with their success in leaving a larger number of offspring to inherit their superior attractions. equal transmission of ornamental characters to both sexes. with many birds, ornaments, which analogy leads us to believe were primarily acquired by the males, have been transmitted equally, or almost equally, to both sexes; and we may now enquire how far this view applies to mammals. with a considerable number of species, especially of the smaller kinds, both sexes have been coloured, independently of sexual selection, for the sake of protection; but not, as far as i can judge, in so many cases, nor in so striking a manner, as in most of the lower classes. audubon remarks that he often mistook the musk-rat (35. fiber zibethicus, audubon and bachman, 'the quadrupeds of north america,' 1846, p. 109.), whilst sitting on the banks of a muddy stream, for a clod of earth, so complete was the resemblance. the hare on her form is a familiar instance of concealment through colour; yet this principle partly fails in a closely-allied species, the rabbit, for when running to its burrow, it is made conspicuous to the sportsman, and no doubt to all beasts of prey, by its upturned white tail. no one doubts that the quadrupeds inhabiting snow-clad regions have been rendered white to protect them from their enemies, or to favour their stealing on their prey. in regions where snow never lies for long, a white coat would be injurious; consequently, species of this colour are extremely rare in the hotter parts of the world. it deserves notice that many quadrupeds inhabiting moderately cold regions, although they do not assume a white winter dress, become paler during this season; and this apparently is the direct result of the conditions to which they have long been exposed. pallas (36. 'novae species quadrupedum e glirium ordine,' 1778, p. 7. what i have called the roe is the capreolus sibiricus subecaudatus of pallas.) states that in siberia a change of this nature occurs with the wolf, two species of mustela, the domestic horse, the equus hemionus, the domestic cow, two species of antelopes, the musk- deer, the roe, elk, and reindeer. the roe, for instance, has a red summer and a greyish-white winter coat; and the latter may perhaps serve as a protection to the animal whilst wandering through the leafless thickets, sprinkled with snow and hoar-frost. if the above-named animals were gradually to extend their range into regions perpetually covered with snow, their pale winter-coats would probably be rendered through natural selection, whiter and whiter, until they became as white as snow. mr. reeks has given me a curious instance of an animal profiting by being peculiarly coloured. he raised from fifty to sixty white and brown piebald rabbits in a large walled orchard; and he had at the same time some similarly coloured cats in his house. such cats, as i have often noticed, are very conspicuous during day; but as they used to lie in watch during the dusk at the mouths of the burrows, the rabbits apparently did not distinguish them from their parti-coloured brethren. the result was that, within eighteen months, every one of these parti-coloured rabbits was destroyed; and there was evidence that this was effected by the cats. colour seems to be advantageous to another animal, the skunk, in a manner of which we have had many instances in other classes. no animal will voluntarily attack one of these creatures on account of the dreadful odour which it emits when irritated; but during the dusk it would not easily be recognised and might be attacked by a beast of prey. hence it is, as mr. belt believes (37. 'the naturalist in nicaragua,' p. 249.), that the skunk is provided with a great white bushy tail, which serves as a conspicuous warning. [fig. 70. tragelaphus scriptus, male (from the knowsley menagerie). fig. 71. damalis pygarga, male (from the knowsley menagerie).] although we must admit that many quadrupeds have received their present tints either as a protection, or as an aid in procuring prey, yet with a host of species, the colours are far too conspicuous and too singularly arranged to allow us to suppose that they serve for these purposes. we may take as an illustration certain antelopes; when we see the square white patch on the throat, the white marks on the fetlocks, and the round black spots on the ears, all more distinct in the male of the portax picta, than in the female;--when we see that the colours are more vivid, that the narrow white lines on the flank and the broad white bar on the shoulder are more distinct in the male oreas derbyanus than in the female;--when we see a similar difference between the sexes of the curiously-ornamented tragelaphus scriptus (fig. 70),--we cannot believe that differences of this kind are of any service to either sex in their daily habits of life. it seems a much more probable conclusion that the various marks were first acquired by the males and their colours intensified through sexual selection, and then partially transferred to the females. if this view be admitted, there can be little doubt that the equally singular colours and marks of many other antelopes, though common to both sexes, have been gained and transmitted in a like manner. both sexes, for instance, of the koodoo (strepsiceros kudu) (fig. 64) have narrow white vertical lines on their hind flanks, and an elegant angular white mark on their foreheads. both sexes in the genus damalis are very oddly coloured; in d. pygarga the back and neck are purplish-red, shading on the flanks into black; and these colours are abruptly separated from the white belly and from a large white space on the buttocks; the head is still more oddly coloured, a large oblong white mask, narrowly-edged with black, covers the face up to the eyes (fig. 71); there are three white stripes on the forehead, and the ears are marked with white. the fawns of this species are of a uniform pale yellowish-brown. in damalis albifrons the colouring of the head differs from that in the last species in a single white stripe replacing the three stripes, and in the ears being almost wholly white. (38. see the fine plates in a. smith's 'zoology of south africa,' and dr. gray's 'gleanings from the menagerie of knowsley.') after having studied to the best of my ability the sexual differences of animals belonging to all classes, i cannot avoid the conclusion that the curiously-arranged colours of many antelopes, though common to both sexes, are the result of sexual selection primarily applied to the male. the same conclusion may perhaps be extended to the tiger, one of the most beautiful animals in the world, the sexes of which cannot be distinguished by colour, even by the dealers in wild beasts. mr. wallace believes (39. 'westminster review,' july 1, 1867, p. 5.) that the striped coat of the tiger "so assimilates with the vertical stems of the bamboo, as to assist greatly in concealing him from his approaching prey." but this view does not appear to me satisfactory. we have some slight evidence that his beauty may be due to sexual selection, for in two species of felis the analogous marks and colours are rather brighter in the male than in the female. the zebra is conspicuously striped, and stripes cannot afford any protection in the open plains of south africa. burchell (40. 'travels in south africa,' 1824, vol. ii. p. 315.) in describing a herd says, "their sleek ribs glistened in the sun, and the brightness and regularity of their striped coats presented a picture of extraordinary beauty, in which probably they are not surpassed by any other quadruped." but as throughout the whole group of the equidae the sexes are identical in colour, we have here no evidence of sexual selection. nevertheless he who attributes the white and dark vertical stripes on the flanks of various antelopes to this process, will probably extend the same view to the royal tiger and beautiful zebra. we have seen in a former chapter that when young animals belonging to any class follow nearly the same habits of life as their parents, and yet are coloured in a different manner, it may be inferred that they have retained the colouring of some ancient and extinct progenitor. in the family of pigs, and in the tapirs, the young are marked with longitudinal stripes, and thus differ from all the existing adult species in these two groups. with many kinds of deer the young are marked with elegant white spots, of which their parents exhibit not a trace. a graduated series can be followed from the axis deer, both sexes of which at all ages and during all seasons are beautifully spotted (the male being rather more strongly coloured than the female), to species in which neither the old nor the young are spotted. i will specify some of the steps in this series. the mantchurian deer (cervus mantchuricus) is spotted during the whole year, but, as i have seen in the zoological gardens, the spots are much plainer during the summer, when the general colour of the coat is lighter, than during the winter, when the general colour is darker and the horns are fully developed. in the hog-deer (hyelaphus porcinus) the spots are extremely conspicuous during the summer when the coat is reddish-brown, but quite disappear during the winter when the coat is brown. (41. dr. gray, 'gleanings from the menagerie of knowsley,' p. 64. mr. blyth, in speaking ('land and water,' 1869, p. 42) of the hog-deer of ceylon, says it is more brightly spotted with white than the common hog-deer, at the season when it renews its horns.) in both these species the young are spotted. in the virginian deer the young are likewise spotted, and about five per cent. of the adult animals living in judge caton's park, as i am informed by him, temporarily exhibit at the period when the red summer coat is being replaced by the bluish winter coat, a row of spots on each flank, which are always the same in number, though very variable in distinctness. from this condition there is but a very small step to the complete absence of spots in the adults at all seasons; and, lastly, to their absence at all ages and seasons, as occurs with certain species. from the existence of this perfect series, and more especially from the fawns of so many species being spotted, we may conclude that the now living members of the deer family are the descendants of some ancient species which, like the axis deer, was spotted at all ages and seasons. a still more ancient progenitor probably somewhat resembled the hyomoschus aquaticus--for this animal is spotted, and the hornless males have large exserted canine teeth, of which some few true deer still retain rudiments. hyomoschus, also, offers one of those interesting cases of a form linking together two groups, for it is intermediate in certain osteological characters between the pachyderms and ruminants, which were formerly thought to be quite distinct. (42. falconer and cautley, 'proc. geolog. soc.' 1843; and falconer's 'pal. memoirs,' vol. i. p. 196.) a curious difficulty here arises. if we admit that coloured spots and stripes were first acquired as ornaments, how comes it that so many existing deer, the descendants of an aboriginally spotted animal, and all the species of pigs and tapirs, the descendants of an aboriginally striped animal, have lost in their adult state their former ornaments? i cannot satisfactorily answer this question. we may feel almost sure that the spots and stripes disappeared at or near maturity in the progenitors of our existing species, so that they were still retained by the young; and, owing to the law of inheritance at corresponding ages, were transmitted to the young of all succeeding generations. it may have been a great advantage to the lion and puma, from the open nature of their usual haunts, to have lost their stripes, and to have been thus rendered less conspicuous to their prey; and if the successive variations, by which this end was gained, occurred rather late in life, the young would have retained their stripes, as is now the case. as to deer, pigs, and tapirs, fritz müller has suggested to me that these animals, by the removal of their spots or stripes through natural selection, would have been less easily seen by their enemies; and that they would have especially required this protection, as soon as the carnivora increased in size and number during the tertiary periods. this may be the true explanation, but it is rather strange that the young should not have been thus protected, and still more so that the adults of some species should have retained their spots, either partially or completely, during part of the year. we know that, when the domestic ass varies and becomes reddish-brown, grey, or black, the stripes on the shoulders and even on the spine frequently disappear, though we cannot explain the cause. very few horses, except dun-coloured kinds, have stripes on any part of their bodies, yet we have good reason to believe that the aboriginal horse was striped on the legs and spine, and probably on the shoulders. (43. the 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' 1868, vol. i. pp. 61-64.) hence the disappearance of the spots and stripes in our adult existing deer, pigs, and tapirs, may be due to a change in the general colour of their coats; but whether this change was effected through sexual or natural selection, or was due to the direct action of the conditions of life, or to some other unknown cause, it is impossible to decide. an observation made by mr. sclater well illustrates our ignorance of the laws which regulate the appearance and disappearance of stripes; the species of asinus which inhabit the asiatic continent are destitute of stripes, not having even the cross shoulder-stripe, whilst those which inhabit africa are conspicuously striped, with the partial exception of a. taeniopus, which has only the cross shoulder-stripe and generally some faint bars on the legs; and this species inhabits the almost intermediate region of upper egypt and abyssinia. (44. 'proc. zool. soc.' 1862, p. 164. see, also, dr. hartmann, 'ann. d. landw.' bd. xliii. s. 222.) quadrumana. [fig. 72. head of semnopithecus rubicundus. this and the following figures (from prof. gervais) are given to shew the odd arrangement and development of the hair on the head. fig. 73. head of semnopithecus comatus. fig. 74. head of cebus capucinus. fig. 75. head of ateles marginatus. fig. 76. head of cebus vellerosus.] before we conclude, it will be well to add a few remarks on the ornaments of monkeys. in most of the species the sexes resemble each other in colour, but in some, as we have seen, the males differ from the females, especially in the colour of the naked parts of the skin, in the development of the beard, whiskers, and mane. many species are coloured either in so extraordinary or so beautiful a manner, and are furnished with such curious and elegant crests of hair, that we can hardly avoid looking at these characters as having been gained for the sake of ornament. the accompanying figures (figs. 72 to 76) serve to shew the arrangement of the hair on the face and head in several species. it is scarcely conceivable that these crests of hair, and the strongly contrasted colours of the fur and skin, can be the result of mere variability without the aid of selection; and it is inconceivable that they can be of use in any ordinary way to these animals. if so, they have probably been gained through sexual selection, though transmitted equally, or almost equally, to both sexes. with many of the quadrumana, we have additional evidence of the action of sexual selection in the greater size and strength of the males, and in the greater development of their canine teeth, in comparison with the females. [fig. 77. cercopithecus petaurista (from brehm).] a few instances will suffice of the strange manner in which both sexes of some species are coloured, and of the beauty of others. the face of the cercopithecus petaurista (fig. 77) is black, the whiskers and beard being white, with a defined, round, white spot on the nose, covered with short white hair, which gives to the animal an almost ludicrous aspect. the semnopithecus frontatus likewise has a blackish face with a long black beard, and a large naked spot on the forehead of a bluish-white colour. the face of macacus lasiotus is dirty flesh-coloured, with a defined red spot on each cheek. the appearance of cercocebus aethiops is grotesque, with its black face, white whiskers and collar, chestnut head, and a large naked white spot over each eyelid. in very many species, the beard, whiskers, and crests of hair round the face are of a different colour from the rest of the head, and when different, are always of a lighter tint (45. i observed this fact in the zoological gardens; and many cases may be seen in the coloured plates in geoffroy st.-hilaire and f. cuvier, 'histoire nat. des mammifères,' tom. i. 1824.), being often pure white, sometimes bright yellow, or reddish. the whole face of the south american brachyurus calvus is of a "glowing scarlet hue"; but this colour does not appear until the animal is nearly mature. (46. bates, 'the naturalist on the amazons,' 1863, vol. ii. p. 310.) the naked skin of the face differs wonderfully in colour in the various species. it is often brown or flesh-colour, with parts perfectly white, and often as black as that of the most sooty negro. in the brachyurus the scarlet tint is brighter than that of the most blushing caucasian damsel. it is sometimes more distinctly orange than in any mongolian, and in several species it is blue, passing into violet or grey. in all the species known to mr. bartlett, in which the adults of both sexes have strongly-coloured faces, the colours are dull or absent during early youth. this likewise holds good with the mandrill and rhesus, in which the face and the posterior parts of the body are brilliantly coloured in one sex alone. in these latter cases we have reason to believe that the colours were acquired through sexual selection; and we are naturally led to extend the same view to the foregoing species, though both sexes when adult have their faces coloured in the same manner. [fig. 78. cercopithecus diana (from brehm).] although many kinds of monkeys are far from beautiful according to our taste, other species are universally admired for their elegant appearance and bright colours. the semnopithecus nemaeus, though peculiarly coloured, is described as extremely pretty; the orange-tinted face is surrounded by long whiskers of glossy whiteness, with a line of chestnut-red over the eyebrows; the fur on the back is of a delicate grey, with a square patch on the loins, the tail and the fore-arms being of a pure white; a gorget of chestnut surmounts the chest; the thighs are black, with the legs chestnut- red. i will mention only two other monkeys for their beauty; and i have selected these as presenting slight sexual differences in colour, which renders it in some degree probable that both sexes owe their elegant appearance to sexual selection. in the moustache-monkey (cercopithecus cephus) the general colour of the fur is mottled-greenish with the throat white; in the male the end of the tail is chestnut, but the face is the most ornamented part, the skin being chiefly bluish-grey, shading into a blackish tint beneath the eyes, with the upper lip of a delicate blue, clothed on the lower edge with a thin black moustache; the whiskers are orange-coloured, with the upper part black, forming a band which extends backwards to the ears, the latter being clothed with whitish hairs. in the zoological society's gardens i have often overheard visitors admiring the beauty of another monkey, deservedly called cercopithecus diana (fig. 78); the general colour of the fur is grey; the chest and inner surface of the forelegs are white; a large triangular defined space on the hinder part of the back is rich chestnut; in the male the inner sides of the thighs and the abdomen are delicate fawn-coloured, and the top of the head is black; the face and ears are intensely black, contrasting finely with a white transverse crest over the eyebrows and a long white peaked beard, of which the basal portion is black. (47. i have seen most of the above monkeys in the zoological society's gardens. the description of the semnopithecus nemaeus is taken from mr. w.c. martin's 'natural history of mammalia,' 1841, p. 460; see also pp. 475, 523.) in these and many other monkeys, the beauty and singular arrangement of their colours, and still more the diversified and elegant arrangement of the crests and tufts of hair on their heads, force the conviction on my mind that these characters have been acquired through sexual selection exclusively as ornaments. summary. the law of battle for the possession of the female appears to prevail throughout the whole great class of mammals. most naturalists will admit that the greater size, strength, courage, and pugnacity of the male, his special weapons of offence, as well as his special means of defence, have been acquired or modified through that form of selection which i have called sexual. this does not depend on any superiority in the general struggle for life, but on certain individuals of one sex, generally the male, being successful in conquering other males, and leaving a larger number of offspring to inherit their superiority than do the less successful males. there is another and more peaceful kind of contest, in which the males endeavour to excite or allure the females by various charms. this is probably carried on in some cases by the powerful odours emitted by the males during the breeding-season; the odoriferous glands having been acquired through sexual selection. whether the same view can be extended to the voice is doubtful, for the vocal organs of the males must have been strengthened by use during maturity, under the powerful excitements of love, jealousy or rage, and will consequently have been transmitted to the same sex. various crests, tufts, and mantles of hair, which are either confined to the male, or are more developed in this sex than in the female, seem in most cases to be merely ornamental, though they sometimes serve as a defence against rival males. there is even reason to suspect that the branching horns of stags, and the elegant horns of certain antelopes, though properly serving as weapons of offence or defence, have been partly modified for ornament. when the male differs in colour from the female, he generally exhibits darker and more strongly-contrasted tints. we do not in this class meet with the splendid red, blue, yellow, and green tints, so common with male birds and many other animals. the naked parts, however, of certain quadrumana must be excepted; for such parts, often oddly situated, are brilliantly coloured in some species. the colours of the male in other cases may be due to simple variation, without the aid of selection. but when the colours are diversified and strongly pronounced, when they are not developed until near maturity, and when they are lost after emasculation, we can hardly avoid the conclusion that they have been acquired through sexual selection for the sake of ornament, and have been transmitted exclusively, or almost exclusively, to the same sex. when both sexes are coloured in the same manner, and the colours are conspicuous or curiously arranged, without being of the least apparent use as a protection, and especially when they are associated with various other ornamental appendages, we are led by analogy to the same conclusion, namely, that they have been acquired through sexual selection, although transmitted to both sexes. that conspicuous and diversified colours, whether confined to the males or common to both sexes, are as a general rule associated in the same groups and sub-groups with other secondary sexual characters serving for war or for ornament, will be found to hold good, if we look back to the various cases given in this and the last chapter. the law of the equal transmission of characters to both sexes, as far as colour and other ornaments are concerned, has prevailed far more extensively with mammals than with birds; but weapons, such as horns and tusks, have often been transmitted either exclusively or much more perfectly to the males than to the females. this is surprising, for, as the males generally use their weapons for defence against enemies of all kinds, their weapons would have been of service to the females. as far as we can see, their absence in this sex can be accounted for only by the form of inheritance which has prevailed. finally, with quadrupeds the contest between the individuals of the same sex, whether peaceful or bloody, has, with the rarest exceptions, been confined to the males; so that the latter have been modified through sexual selection, far more commonly than the females, either for fighting with each other or for alluring the opposite sex. part iii. sexual selection in relation to man, and conclusion. chapter xix. secondary sexual characters of man. differences between man and woman--causes of such differences and of certain characters common to both sexes--law of battle--differences in mental powers, and voice--on the influence of beauty in determining the marriages of mankind--attention paid by savages to ornaments--their ideas of beauty in woman--the tendency to exaggerate each natural peculiarity. with mankind the differences between the sexes are greater than in most of the quadrumana, but not so great as in some, for instance, the mandrill. man on an average is considerably taller, heavier, and stronger than woman, with squarer shoulders and more plainly-pronounced muscles. owing to the relation which exists between muscular development and the projection of the brows (1. schaaffhausen, translation in 'anthropological review,' oct. 1868, pp. 419, 420, 427.), the superciliary ridge is generally more marked in man than in woman. his body, and especially his face, is more hairy, and his voice has a different and more powerful tone. in certain races the women are said to differ slightly in tint from the men. for instance, schweinfurth, in speaking of a negress belonging to the monbuttoos, who inhabit the interior of africa a few degrees north of the equator, says, "like all her race, she had a skin several shades lighter than her husband's, being something of the colour of half-roasted coffee." (2. 'the heart of africa,' english transl. 1873, vol i. p. 544.) as the women labour in the fields and are quite unclothed, it is not likely that they differ in colour from the men owing to less exposure to the weather. european women are perhaps the brighter coloured of the two sexes, as may be seen when both have been equally exposed. man is more courageous, pugnacious and energetic than woman, and has a more inventive genius. his brain is absolutely larger, but whether or not proportionately to his larger body, has not, i believe, been fully ascertained. in woman the face is rounder; the jaws and the base of the skull smaller; the outlines of the body rounder, in parts more prominent; and her pelvis is broader than in man (3. ecker, translation, in 'anthropological review,' oct. 1868, pp. 351-356. the comparison of the form of the skull in men and women has been followed out with much care by welcker.); but this latter character may perhaps be considered rather as a primary than a secondary sexual character. she comes to maturity at an earlier age than man. as with animals of all classes, so with man, the distinctive characters of the male sex are not fully developed until he is nearly mature; and if emasculated they never appear. the beard, for instance, is a secondary sexual character, and male children are beardless, though at an early age they have abundant hair on the head. it is probably due to the rather late appearance in life of the successive variations whereby man has acquired his masculine characters, that they are transmitted to the male sex alone. male and female children resemble each other closely, like the young of so many other animals in which the adult sexes differ widely; they likewise resemble the mature female much more closely than the mature male. the female, however, ultimately assumes certain distinctive characters, and in the formation of her skull, is said to be intermediate between the child and the man. (4. ecker and welcker, ibid. pp. 352, 355; vogt, 'lectures on man,' eng. translat. p. 81.) again, as the young of closely allied though distinct species do not differ nearly so much from each other as do the adults, so it is with the children of the different races of man. some have even maintained that race-differences cannot be detected in the infantile skull. (5. schaaffhausen, 'anthropolog. review,' ibid. p. 429.) in regard to colour, the new-born negro child is reddish nut-brown, which soon becomes slaty-grey; the black colour being fully developed within a year in the soudan, but not until three years in egypt. the eyes of the negro are at first blue, and the hair chestnut-brown rather than black, being curled only at the ends. the children of the australians immediately after birth are yellowish-brown, and become dark at a later age. those of the guaranys of paraguay are whitish-yellow, but they acquire in the course of a few weeks the yellowish-brown tint of their parents. similar observations have been made in other parts of america. (6. pruner-bey, on negro infants as quoted by vogt, 'lectures on man,' eng. translat. 1864, p. 189: for further facts on negro infants, as quoted from winterbottom and camper, see lawrence, 'lectures on physiology,' etc. 1822, p. 451. for the infants of the guaranys, see rengger, 'säugethiere,' etc. s. 3. see also godron, 'de l'espèce,' tom. ii. 1859, p. 253. for the australians, waitz, 'introduction to anthropology,' eng. translat. 1863, p. 99.) i have specified the foregoing differences between the male and female sex in mankind, because they are curiously like those of the quadrumana. with these animals the female is mature at an earlier age than the male; at least this is certainly the case in cebus azarae. (7. rengger, 'säugethiere,' etc., 1830, s. 49.) the males of most species are larger and stronger than the females, of which fact the gorilla affords a well- known instance. even in so trifling a character as the greater prominence of the superciliary ridge, the males of certain monkeys differ from the females (8. as in macacus cynomolgus (desmarest, 'mammalogie,' p. 65), and in hylobates agilis (geoffroy st.-hilaire and f. cuvier, 'histoire nat. des mammifères,' 1824, tom. i. p. 2).), and agree in this respect with mankind. in the gorilla and certain other monkeys, the cranium of the adult male presents a strongly-marked sagittal crest, which is absent in the female; and ecker found a trace of a similar difference between the two sexes in the australians. (9. 'anthropological review,' oct. 1868, p. 353.) with monkeys when there is any difference in the voice, that of the male is the more powerful. we have seen that certain male monkeys have a well- developed beard, which is quite deficient, or much less developed in the female. no instance is known of the beard, whiskers, or moustache being larger in the female than in the male monkey. even in the colour of the beard there is a curious parallelism between man and the quadrumana, for with man when the beard differs in colour from the hair of the head, as is commonly the case, it is, i believe, almost always of a lighter tint, being often reddish. i have repeatedly observed this fact in england; but two gentlemen have lately written to me, saying that they form an exception to the rule. one of these gentlemen accounts for the fact by the wide difference in colour of the hair on the paternal and maternal sides of his family. both had been long aware of this peculiarity (one of them having often been accused of dyeing his beard), and had been thus led to observe other men, and were convinced that the exceptions were very rare. dr. hooker attended to this little point for me in russia, and found no exception to the rule. in calcutta, mr. j. scott, of the botanic gardens, was so kind as to observe the many races of men to be seen there, as well as in some other parts of india, namely, two races of sikhim, the bhoteas, hindoos, burmese, and chinese, most of which races have very little hair on the face; and he always found that when there was any difference in colour between the hair of the head and the beard, the latter was invariably lighter. now with monkeys, as has already been stated, the beard frequently differs strikingly in colour from the hair of the head, and in such cases it is always of a lighter hue, being often pure white, sometimes yellow or reddish. (10. mr. blyth informs me that he has only seen one instance of the beard, whiskers, etc., in a monkey becoming white with old age, as is so commonly the case with us. this, however, occurred in an aged macacus cynomolgus, kept in confinement whose moustaches were "remarkably long and human-like." altogether this old monkey presented a ludicrous resemblance to one of the reigning monarchs of europe, after whom he was universally nick-named. in certain races of man the hair on the head hardly ever becomes grey; thus mr. d. forbes has never, as he informs me, seen an instance with the aymaras and quichuas of south america.) in regard to the general hairiness of the body, the women in all races are less hairy than the men; and in some few quadrumana the under side of the body of the female is less hairy than that of the male. (11. this is the case with the females of several species of hylobates; see geoffroy st.- hilaire and f. cuvier, 'hist. nat. des mamm.' tom. i. see also, on h. lar, 'penny cyclopedia,' vol. ii. pp. 149, 150.) lastly, male monkeys, like men, are bolder and fiercer than the females. they lead the troop, and when there is danger, come to the front. we thus see how close is the parallelism between the sexual differences of man and the quadrumana. with some few species, however, as with certain baboons, the orang and the gorilla, there is a considerably greater difference between the sexes, as in the size of the canine teeth, in the development and colour of the hair, and especially in the colour of the naked parts of the skin, than in mankind. all the secondary sexual characters of man are highly variable, even within the limits of the same race; and they differ much in the several races. these two rules hold good generally throughout the animal kingdom. in the excellent observations made on board the novara (12. the results were deduced by dr. weisbach from the measurements made by drs. k. scherzer and schwarz, see 'reise der novara: anthropolog. theil,' 1867, ss. 216, 231, 234, 236, 239, 269.), the male australians were found to exceed the females by only 65 millim. in height, whilst with the javans the average excess was 218 millim.; so that in this latter race the difference in height between the sexes is more than thrice as great as with the australians. numerous measurements were carefully made of the stature, the circumference of the neck and chest, the length of the back-bone and of the arms, in various races; and nearly all these measurements shew that the males differ much more from one another than do the females. this fact indicates that, as far as these characters are concerned, it is the male which has been chiefly modified, since the several races diverged from their common stock. the development of the beard and the hairiness of the body differ remarkably in the men of distinct races, and even in different tribes or families of the same race. we europeans see this amongst ourselves. in the island of st. kilda, according to martin (13. 'voyage to st. kilda' (3rd ed. 1753), p. 37.), the men do not acquire beards until the age of thirty or upwards, and even then the beards are very thin. on the europaeo-asiatic continent, beards prevail until we pass beyond india; though with the natives of ceylon they are often absent, as was noticed in ancient times by diodorus. (14. sir j.e. tennent, 'ceylon,' vol. ii. 1859, p. 107.) eastward of india beards disappear, as with the siamese, malays, kalmucks, chinese, and japanese; nevertheless, the ainos (15. quatrefages, 'revue des cours scientifiques,' aug. 29, 1868, p. 630; vogt, 'lectures on man,' eng. trans. p. 127.), who inhabit the northernmost islands of the japan archipelago, are the hairiest men in the world. with negroes the beard is scanty or wanting, and they rarely have whiskers; in both sexes the body is frequently almost destitute of fine down. (16. on the beards of negroes, vogt, 'lectures,' etc. p. 127; waitz, 'introduct. to anthropology,' engl. translat. 1863, vol. i. p. 96. it is remarkable that in the united states ('investigations in military and anthropological statistics of american soldiers,' 1869, p. 569) the pure negroes and their crossed offspring seem to have bodies almost as hairy as europeans.) on the other hand, the papuans of the malay archipelago, who are nearly as black as negroes, possess well-developed beards. (17. wallace, 'the malay arch.' vol. ii. 1869, p. 178.) in the pacific ocean the inhabitants of the fiji archipelago have large bushy beards, whilst those of the not distant archipelagoes of tonga and samoa are beardless; but these men belong to distinct races. in the ellice group all the inhabitants belong to the same race; yet on one island alone, namely nunemaya, "the men have splendid beards"; whilst on the other islands "they have, as a rule, a dozen straggling hairs for a beard." (18. dr. j. barnard davis on oceanic races, in 'anthropological review,' april 1870, pp. 185, 191.) throughout the great american continent the men may be said to be beardless; but in almost all the tribes a few short hairs are apt to appear on the face, especially in old age. with the tribes of north america, catlin estimates that eighteen out of twenty men are completely destitute by nature of a beard; but occasionally there may be seen a man, who has neglected to pluck out the hairs at puberty, with a soft beard an inch or two in length. the guaranys of paraguay differ from all the surrounding tribes in having a small beard, and even some hair on the body, but no whiskers. (19. catlin, 'north american indians,' 3rd. ed. 1842, vol. ii. p. 227. on the guaranys, see azara, 'voyages dans l'amérique merid.' tom. ii. 1809, p. 85; also rengger, 'säugethiere von paraguay,' s. 3.) i am informed by mr. d. forbes, who particularly attended to this point, that the aymaras and quichuas of the cordillera are remarkably hairless, yet in old age a few straggling hairs occasionally appear on the chin. the men of these two tribes have very little hair on the various parts of the body where hair grows abundantly in europeans, and the women have none on the corresponding parts. the hair on the head, however, attains an extraordinary length in both sexes, often reaching almost to the ground; and this is likewise the case with some of the n. american tribes. in the amount of hair, and in the general shape of the body, the sexes of the american aborigines do not differ so much from each other, as in most other races. (20. prof. and mrs. agassiz ('journey in brazil,' p. 530) remark that the sexes of the american indians differ less than those of the negroes and of the higher races. see also rengger, ibid. p. 3, on the guaranys.) this fact is analogous with what occurs with some closely allied monkeys; thus the sexes of the chimpanzee are not as different as those of the orang or gorilla. (21. rutimeyer, 'die grenzen der thierwelt; eine betrachtung zu darwin's lehre,' 1868, s. 54.) in the previous chapters we have seen that with mammals, birds, fishes, insects, etc., many characters, which there is every reason to believe were primarily gained through sexual selection by one sex, have been transferred to the other. as this same form of transmission has apparently prevailed much with mankind, it will save useless repetition if we discuss the origin of characters peculiar to the male sex together with certain other characters common to both sexes. law of battle. with savages, for instance, the australians, the women are the constant cause of war both between members of the same tribe and between distinct tribes. so no doubt it was in ancient times; "nam fuit ante helenam mulier teterrima belli causa." with some of the north american indians, the contest is reduced to a system. that excellent observer, hearne (22. 'a journey from prince of wales fort,' 8vo. ed. dublin, 1796, p. 104. sir j. lubbock ('origin of civilisation,' 1870, p. 69) gives other and similar cases in north america. for the guanas of south america see azara, 'voyages,' etc. tom. ii. p. 94.), says:--"it has ever been the custom among these people for the men to wrestle for any woman to whom they are attached; and, of course, the strongest party always carries off the prize. a weak man, unless he be a good hunter, and well-beloved, is seldom permitted to keep a wife that a stronger man thinks worth his notice. this custom prevails throughout all the tribes, and causes a great spirit of emulation among their youth, who are upon all occasions, from their childhood, trying their strength and skill in wrestling." with the guanas of south america, azara states that the men rarely marry till twenty years old or more, as before that age they cannot conquer their rivals. other similar facts could be given; but even if we had no evidence on this head, we might feel almost sure, from the analogy of the higher quadrumana (23. on the fighting of the male gorillas, see dr. savage, in 'boston journal of natural history,' vol. v. 1847, p. 423. on presbytis entellus, see the 'indian field,' 1859, p. 146.), that the law of battle had prevailed with man during the early stages of his development. the occasional appearance at the present day of canine teeth which project above the others, with traces of a diastema or open space for the reception of the opposite canines, is in all probability a case of reversion to a former state, when the progenitors of man were provided with these weapons, like so many existing male quadrumana. it was remarked in a former chapter that as man gradually became erect, and continually used his hands and arms for fighting with sticks and stones, as well as for the other purposes of life, he would have used his jaws and teeth less and less. the jaws, together with their muscles, would then have been reduced through disuse, as would the teeth through the not well understood principles of correlation and economy of growth; for we everywhere see that parts, which are no longer of service, are reduced in size. by such steps the original inequality between the jaws and teeth in the two sexes of mankind would ultimately have been obliterated. the case is almost parallel with that of many male ruminants, in which the canine teeth have been reduced to mere rudiments, or have disappeared, apparently in consequence of the development of horns. as the prodigious difference between the skulls of the two sexes in the orang and gorilla stands in close relation with the development of the immense canine teeth in the males, we may infer that the reduction of the jaws and teeth in the early male progenitors of man must have led to a most striking and favourable change in his appearance. there can be little doubt that the greater size and strength of man, in comparison with woman, together with his broader shoulders, more developed muscles, rugged outline of body, his greater courage and pugnacity, are all due in chief part to inheritance from his half-human male ancestors. these characters would, however, have been preserved or even augmented during the long ages of man's savagery, by the success of the strongest and boldest men, both in the general struggle for life and in their contests for wives; a success which would have ensured their leaving a more numerous progeny than their less favoured brethren. it is not probable that the greater strength of man was primarily acquired through the inherited effects of his having worked harder than woman for his own subsistence and that of his family; for the women in all barbarous nations are compelled to work at least as hard as the men. with civilised people the arbitrament of battle for the possession of the women has long ceased; on the other hand, the men, as a general rule, have to work harder than the women for their joint subsistence, and thus their greater strength will have been kept up. difference in the mental powers of the two sexes. with respect to differences of this nature between man and woman, it is probable that sexual selection has played a highly important part. i am aware that some writers doubt whether there is any such inherent difference; but this is at least probable from the analogy of the lower animals which present other secondary sexual characters. no one disputes that the bull differs in disposition from the cow, the wild-boar from the sow, the stallion from the mare, and, as is well known to the keepers of menageries, the males of the larger apes from the females. woman seems to differ from man in mental disposition, chiefly in her greater tenderness and less selfishness; and this holds good even with savages, as shewn by a well-known passage in mungo park's travels, and by statements made by many other travellers. woman, owing to her maternal instincts, displays these qualities towards her infants in an eminent degree; therefore it is likely that she would often extend them towards her fellow-creatures. man is the rival of other men; he delights in competition, and this leads to ambition which passes too easily into selfishness. these latter qualities seem to be his natural and unfortunate birthright. it is generally admitted that with woman the powers of intuition, of rapid perception, and perhaps of imitation, are more strongly marked than in man; but some, at least, of these faculties are characteristic of the lower races, and therefore of a past and lower state of civilisation. the chief distinction in the intellectual powers of the two sexes is shewn by man's attaining to a higher eminence, in whatever he takes up, than can woman--whether requiring deep thought, reason, or imagination, or merely the use of the senses and hands. if two lists were made of the most eminent men and women in poetry, painting, sculpture, music (inclusive both of composition and performance), history, science, and philosophy, with half-a-dozen names under each subject, the two lists would not bear comparison. we may also infer, from the law of the deviation from averages, so well illustrated by mr. galton, in his work on 'hereditary genius,' that if men are capable of a decided pre-eminence over women in many subjects, the average of mental power in man must be above that of woman. amongst the half-human progenitors of man, and amongst savages, there have been struggles between the males during many generations for the possession of the females. but mere bodily strength and size would do little for victory, unless associated with courage, perseverance, and determined energy. with social animals, the young males have to pass through many a contest before they win a female, and the older males have to retain their females by renewed battles. they have, also, in the case of mankind, to defend their females, as well as their young, from enemies of all kinds, and to hunt for their joint subsistence. but to avoid enemies or to attack them with success, to capture wild animals, and to fashion weapons, requires the aid of the higher mental faculties, namely, observation, reason, invention, or imagination. these various faculties will thus have been continually put to the test and selected during manhood; they will, moreover, have been strengthened by use during this same period of life. consequently in accordance with the principle often alluded to, we might expect that they would at least tend to be transmitted chiefly to the male offspring at the corresponding period of manhood. now, when two men are put into competition, or a man with a woman, both possessed of every mental quality in equal perfection, save that one has higher energy, perseverance, and courage, the latter will generally become more eminent in every pursuit, and will gain the ascendancy. (24. j. stuart mill remarks ('the subjection of women,' 1869, p. 122), "the things in which man most excels woman are those which require most plodding, and long hammering at single thoughts." what is this but energy and perseverance?) he may be said to possess genius--for genius has been declared by a great authority to be patience; and patience, in this sense, means unflinching, undaunted perseverance. but this view of genius is perhaps deficient; for without the higher powers of the imagination and reason, no eminent success can be gained in many subjects. these latter faculties, as well as the former, will have been developed in man, partly through sexual selection,--that is, through the contest of rival males, and partly through natural selection, that is, from success in the general struggle for life; and as in both cases the struggle will have been during maturity, the characters gained will have been transmitted more fully to the male than to the female offspring. it accords in a striking manner with this view of the modification and re-inforcement of many of our mental faculties by sexual selection, that, firstly, they notoriously undergo a considerable change at puberty (25. maudsley, 'mind and body,' p. 31.), and, secondly, that eunuchs remain throughout life inferior in these same qualities. thus, man has ultimately become superior to woman. it is, indeed, fortunate that the law of the equal transmission of characters to both sexes prevails with mammals; otherwise, it is probable that man would have become as superior in mental endowment to woman, as the peacock is in ornamental plumage to the peahen. it must be borne in mind that the tendency in characters acquired by either sex late in life, to be transmitted to the same sex at the same age, and of early acquired characters to be transmitted to both sexes, are rules which, though general, do not always hold. if they always held good, we might conclude (but i here exceed my proper bounds) that the inherited effects of the early education of boys and girls would be transmitted equally to both sexes; so that the present inequality in mental power between the sexes would not be effaced by a similar course of early training; nor can it have been caused by their dissimilar early training. in order that woman should reach the same standard as man, she ought, when nearly adult, to be trained to energy and perseverance, and to have her reason and imagination exercised to the highest point; and then she would probably transmit these qualities chiefly to her adult daughters. all women, however, could not be thus raised, unless during many generations those who excelled in the above robust virtues were married, and produced offspring in larger numbers than other women. as before remarked of bodily strength, although men do not now fight for their wives, and this form of selection has passed away, yet during manhood, they generally undergo a severe struggle in order to maintain themselves and their families; and this will tend to keep up or even increase their mental powers, and, as a consequence, the present inequality between the sexes. (26. an observation by vogt bears on this subject: he says, "it is a remarkable circumstance, that the difference between the sexes, as regards the cranial cavity, increases with the development of the race, so that the male european excels much more the female, than the negro the negress. welcker confirms this statement of huschke from his measurements of negro and german skulls." but vogt admits ('lectures on man,' eng. translat. 1864, p. 81) that more observations are requisite on this point. voice and musical powers. in some species of quadrumana there is a great difference between the adult sexes, in the power of their voices and in the development of the vocal organs; and man appears to have inherited this difference from his early progenitors. his vocal cords are about one-third longer than in woman, or than in boys; and emasculation produces the same effect on him as on the lower animals, for it "arrests that prominent growth of the thyroid, etc., which accompanies the elongation of the cords." (27. owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 603.) with respect to the cause of this difference between the sexes, i have nothing to add to the remarks in the last chapter on the probable effects of the long-continued use of the vocal organs by the male under the excitement of love, rage and jealousy. according to sir duncan gibb (28. 'journal of the anthropological society,' april 1869, p. lvii. and lxvi.), the voice and the form of the larynx differ in the different races of mankind; but with the tartars, chinese, etc., the voice of the male is said not to differ so much from that of the female, as in most other races. the capacity and love for singing or music, though not a sexual character in man, must not here be passed over. although the sounds emitted by animals of all kinds serve many purposes, a strong case can be made out, that the vocal organs were primarily used and perfected in relation to the propagation of the species. insects and some few spiders are the lowest animals which voluntarily produce any sound; and this is generally effected by the aid of beautifully constructed stridulating organs, which are often confined to the males. the sounds thus produced consist, i believe in all cases, of the same note, repeated rhythmically (29. dr. scudder, 'notes on stridulation,' in 'proc. boston soc. of nat. hist.' vol. xi. april 1868.); and this is sometimes pleasing even to the ears of man. the chief and, in some cases, exclusive purpose appears to be either to call or charm the opposite sex. the sounds produced by fishes are said in some cases to be made only by the males during the breeding-season. all the air-breathing vertebrata necessarily possess an apparatus for inhaling and expelling air, with a pipe capable of being closed at one end. hence when the primeval members of this class were strongly excited and their muscles violently contracted, purposeless sounds would almost certainly have been produced; and these, if they proved in any way serviceable, might readily have been modified or intensified by the preservation of properly adapted variations. the lowest vertebrates which breathe air are amphibians; and of these, frogs and toads possess vocal organs, which are incessantly used during the breeding- season, and which are often more highly developed in the male than in the female. the male alone of the tortoise utters a noise, and this only during the season of love. male alligators roar or bellow during the same season. every one knows how much birds use their vocal organs as a means of courtship; and some species likewise perform what may be called instrumental music. in the class of mammals, with which we are here more particularly concerned, the males of almost all the species use their voices during the breeding-season much more than at any other time; and some are absolutely mute excepting at this season. with other species both sexes, or only the females, use their voices as a love-call. considering these facts, and that the vocal organs of some quadrupeds are much more largely developed in the male than in the female, either permanently or temporarily during the breeding-season; and considering that in most of the lower classes the sounds produced by the males, serve not only to call but to excite or allure the female, it is a surprising fact that we have not as yet any good evidence that these organs are used by male mammals to charm the females. the american mycetes caraya perhaps forms an exception, as does the hylobates agilis, an ape allied to man. this gibbon has an extremely loud but musical voice. mr. waterhouse states (30. given in w.c.l. martin's 'general introduction to natural history of mamm. animals,' 1841, p. 432; owen, 'anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii, p. 600.), "it appeared to me that in ascending and descending the scale, the intervals were always exactly half-tones; and i am sure that the highest note was the exact octave to the lowest. the quality of the notes is very musical; and i do not doubt that a good violinist would be able to give a correct idea of the gibbon's composition, excepting as regards its loudness." mr. waterhouse then gives the notes. professor owen, who is a musician, confirms the foregoing statement, and remarks, though erroneously, that this gibbon "alone of brute mammals may be said to sing." it appears to be much excited after its performance. unfortunately, its habits have never been closely observed in a state of nature; but from the analogy of other animals, it is probable that it uses its musical powers more especially during the season of courtship. this gibbon is not the only species in the genus which sings, for my son, francis darwin, attentively listened in the zoological gardens to h. leuciscus whilst singing a cadence of three notes, in true musical intervals and with a clear musical tone. it is a more surprising fact that certain rodents utter musical sounds. singing mice have often been mentioned and exhibited, but imposture has commonly been suspected. we have, however, at last a clear account by a well-known observer, the rev. s. lockwood (31. the 'american naturalist,' 1871, p. 761.), of the musical powers of an american species, the hesperomys cognatus, belonging to a genus distinct from that of the english mouse. this little animal was kept in confinement, and the performance was repeatedly heard. in one of the two chief songs, "the last bar would frequently be prolonged to two or three; and she would sometimes change from c sharp and d, to c natural and d, then warble on these two notes awhile, and wind up with a quick chirp on c sharp and d. the distinctness between the semitones was very marked, and easily appreciable to a good ear." mr. lockwood gives both songs in musical notation; and adds that though this little mouse "had no ear for time, yet she would keep to the key of b (two flats) and strictly in a major key."..."her soft clear voice falls an octave with all the precision possible; then at the wind up, it rises again into a very quick trill on c sharp and d." a critic has asked how the ears of man, and he ought to have added of other animals, could have been adapted by selection so as to distinguish musical notes. but this question shews some confusion on the subject; a noise is the sensation resulting from the co-existence of several aerial "simple vibrations" of various periods, each of which intermits so frequently that its separate existence cannot be perceived. it is only in the want of continuity of such vibrations, and in their want of harmony inter se, that a noise differs from a musical note. thus an ear to be capable of discriminating noises--and the high importance of this power to all animals is admitted by every one--must be sensitive to musical notes. we have evidence of this capacity even low down in the animal scale: thus crustaceans are provided with auditory hairs of different lengths, which have been seen to vibrate when the proper musical notes are struck. (32. helmholtz, 'theorie phys. de la musique,' 1868, p. 187.) as stated in a previous chapter, similar observations have been made on the hairs of the antennae of gnats. it has been positively asserted by good observers that spiders are attracted by music. it is also well known that some dogs howl when hearing particular tones. (33. several accounts have been published to this effect. mr. peach writes to me that an old dog of his howls when b flat is sounded on the flute, and to no other note. i may add another instance of a dog always whining, when one note on a concertina, which was out of tune, was played.) seals apparently appreciate music, and their fondness for it "was well known to the ancients, and is often taken advantage of by the hunters at the present day." (34. mr. r. brown, in 'proc. zool. soc.' 1868, p. 410.) therefore, as far as the mere perception of musical notes is concerned, there seems no special difficulty in the case of man or of any other animal. helmholtz has explained on physiological principles why concords are agreeable, and discords disagreeable to the human ear; but we are little concerned with these, as music in harmony is a late invention. we are more concerned with melody, and here again, according to helmholtz, it is intelligible why the notes of our musical scale are used. the ear analyses all sounds into their component "simple vibrations," although we are not conscious of this analysis. in a musical note the lowest in pitch of these is generally predominant, and the others which are less marked are the octave, the twelfth, the second octave, etc., all harmonies of the fundamental predominant note; any two notes of our scale have many of these harmonic over-tones in common. it seems pretty clear then, that if an animal always wished to sing precisely the same song, he would guide himself by sounding those notes in succession, which possess many over- tones in common--that is, he would choose for his song, notes which belong to our musical scale. but if it be further asked why musical tones in a certain order and rhythm give man and other animals pleasure, we can no more give the reason than for the pleasantness of certain tastes and smells. that they do give pleasure of some kind to animals, we may infer from their being produced during the season of courtship by many insects, spiders, fishes, amphibians, and birds; for unless the females were able to appreciate such sounds and were excited or charmed by them, the persevering efforts of the males, and the complex structures often possessed by them alone, would be useless; and this it is impossible to believe. human song is generally admitted to be the basis or origin of instrumental music. as neither the enjoyment nor the capacity of producing musical notes are faculties of the least use to man in reference to his daily habits of life, they must be ranked amongst the most mysterious with which he is endowed. they are present, though in a very rude condition, in men of all races, even the most savage; but so different is the taste of the several races, that our music gives no pleasure to savages, and their music is to us in most cases hideous and unmeaning. dr. seemann, in some interesting remarks on this subject (35. 'journal of anthropological society,' oct. 1870, p. clv. see also the several later chapters in sir john lubbock's 'prehistoric times,' 2nd ed. 1869, which contain an admirable account of the habits of savages.), "doubts whether even amongst the nations of western europe, intimately connected as they are by close and frequent intercourse, the music of the one is interpreted in the same sense by the others. by travelling eastwards we find that there is certainly a different language of music. songs of joy and dance- accompaniments are no longer, as with us, in the major keys, but always in the minor." whether or not the half-human progenitors of man possessed, like the singing gibbons, the capacity of producing, and therefore no doubt of appreciating, musical notes, we know that man possessed these faculties at a very remote period. m. lartet has described two flutes made out of the bones and horns of the reindeer, found in caves together with flint tools and the remains of extinct animals. the arts of singing and of dancing are also very ancient, and are now practised by all or nearly all the lowest races of man. poetry, which may be considered as the offspring of song, is likewise so ancient, that many persons have felt astonished that it should have arisen during the earliest ages of which we have any record. we see that the musical faculties, which are not wholly deficient in any race, are capable of prompt and high development, for hottentots and negroes have become excellent musicians, although in their native countries they rarely practise anything that we should consider music. schweinfurth, however, was pleased with some of the simple melodies which he heard in the interior of africa. but there is nothing anomalous in the musical faculties lying dormant in man: some species of birds which never naturally sing, can without much difficulty be taught to do so; thus a house-sparrow has learnt the song of a linnet. as these two species are closely allied, and belong to the order of insessores, which includes nearly all the singing-birds in the world, it is possible that a progenitor of the sparrow may have been a songster. it is more remarkable that parrots, belonging to a group distinct from the insessores, and having differently constructed vocal organs, can be taught not only to speak, but to pipe or whistle tunes invented by man, so that they must have some musical capacity. nevertheless it would be very rash to assume that parrots are descended from some ancient form which was a songster. many cases could be advanced of organs and instincts originally adapted for one purpose, having been utilised for some distinct purpose. (36. since this chapter was printed, i have seen a valuable article by mr. chauncey wright ('north american review,' oct. 1870, page 293), who, in discussing the above subject, remarks, "there are many consequences of the ultimate laws or uniformities of nature, through which the acquisition of one useful power will bring with it many resulting advantages as well as limiting disadvantages, actual or possible, which the principle of utility may not have comprehended in its action." as i have attempted to shew in an early chapter of this work, this principle has an important bearing on the acquisition by man of some of his mental characteristics.) hence the capacity for high musical development which the savage races of man possess, may be due either to the practice by our semi-human progenitors of some rude form of music, or simply to their having acquired the proper vocal organs for a different purpose. but in this latter case we must assume, as in the above instance of parrots, and as seems to occur with many animals, that they already possessed some sense of melody. music arouses in us various emotions, but not the more terrible ones of horror, fear, rage, etc. it awakens the gentler feelings of tenderness and love, which readily pass into devotion. in the chinese annals it is said, "music hath the power of making heaven descend upon earth." it likewise stirs up in us the sense of triumph and the glorious ardour for war. these powerful and mingled feelings may well give rise to the sense of sublimity. we can concentrate, as dr. seemann observes, greater intensity of feeling in a single musical note than in pages of writing. it is probable that nearly the same emotions, but much weaker and far less complex, are felt by birds when the male pours forth his full volume of song, in rivalry with other males, to captivate the female. love is still the commonest theme of our songs. as herbert spencer remarks, "music arouses dormant sentiments of which we had not conceived the possibility, and do not know the meaning; or, as richter says, tells us of things we have not seen and shall not see." conversely, when vivid emotions are felt and expressed by the orator, or even in common speech, musical cadences and rhythm are instinctively used. the negro in africa when excited often bursts forth in song; "another will reply in song, whilst the company, as if touched by a musical wave, murmur a chorus in perfect unison." (37. winwood reade, 'the martyrdom of man,' 1872, p. 441, and 'african sketch book,' 1873, vol. ii. p. 313.) even monkeys express strong feelings in different tones-- anger and impatience by low,--fear and pain by high notes. (38. rengger, 'säugethiere von paraguay,' s. 49.) the sensations and ideas thus excited in us by music, or expressed by the cadences of oratory, appear from their vagueness, yet depth, like mental reversions to the emotions and thoughts of a long-past age. all these facts with respect to music and impassioned speech become intelligible to a certain extent, if we may assume that musical tones and rhythm were used by our half-human ancestors, during the season of courtship, when animals of all kinds are excited not only by love, but by the strong passions of jealousy, rivalry, and triumph. from the deeply- laid principle of inherited associations, musical tones in this case would be likely to call up vaguely and indefinitely the strong emotions of a long-past age. as we have every reason to suppose that articulate speech is one of the latest, as it certainly is the highest, of the arts acquired by man, and as the instinctive power of producing musical notes and rhythms is developed low down in the animal series, it would be altogether opposed to the principle of evolution, if we were to admit that man's musical capacity has been developed from the tones used in impassioned speech. we must suppose that the rhythms and cadences of oratory are derived from previously developed musical powers. (39. see the very interesting discussion on the 'origin and function of music,' by mr. herbert spencer, in his collected 'essays,' 1858, p. 359. mr. spencer comes to an exactly opposite conclusion to that at which i have arrived. he concludes, as did diderot formerly, that the cadences used in emotional speech afford the foundation from which music has been developed; whilst i conclude that musical notes and rhythm were first acquired by the male or female progenitors of mankind for the sake of charming the opposite sex. thus musical tones became firmly associated with some of the strongest passions an animal is capable of feeling, and are consequently used instinctively, or through association when strong emotions are expressed in speech. mr. spencer does not offer any satisfactory explanation, nor can i, why high or deep notes should be expressive, both with man and the lower animals, of certain emotions. mr. spencer gives also an interesting discussion on the relations between poetry, recitative and song.) we can thus understand how it is that music, dancing, song, and poetry are such very ancient arts. we may go even further than this, and, as remarked in a former chapter, believe that musical sounds afforded one of the bases for the development of language. (40. i find in lord monboddo's 'origin of language,' vol. i. 1774, p. 469, that dr. blacklock likewise thought "that the first language among men was music, and that before our ideas were expressed by articulate sounds, they were communicated by tones varied according to different degrees of gravity and acuteness.") as the males of several quadrumanous animals have their vocal organs much more developed than in the females, and as a gibbon, one of the anthropomorphous apes, pours forth a whole octave of musical notes and may be said to sing, it appears probable that the progenitors of man, either the males or females or both sexes, before acquiring the power of expressing their mutual love in articulate language, endeavoured to charm each other with musical notes and rhythm. so little is known about the use of the voice by the quadrumana during the season of love, that we have no means of judging whether the habit of singing was first acquired by our male or female ancestors. women are generally thought to possess sweeter voices than men, and as far as this serves as any guide, we may infer that they first acquired musical powers in order to attract the other sex. (41. see an interesting discussion on this subject by haeckel, 'generelle morphologie,' b. ii. 1866, s. 246.) but if so, this must have occurred long ago, before our ancestors had become sufficiently human to treat and value their women merely as useful slaves. the impassioned orator, bard, or musician, when with his varied tones and cadences he excites the strongest emotions in his hearers, little suspects that he uses the same means by which his half-human ancestors long ago aroused each other's ardent passions, during their courtship and rivalry. the influence of beauty in determining the marriages of mankind. in civilised life man is largely, but by no means exclusively, influenced in the choice of his wife by external appearance; but we are chiefly concerned with primeval times, and our only means of forming a judgment on this subject is to study the habits of existing semi-civilised and savage nations. if it can be shewn that the men of different races prefer women having various characteristics, or conversely with the women, we have then to enquire whether such choice, continued during many generations, would produce any sensible effect on the race, either on one sex or both according to the form of inheritance which has prevailed. it will be well first to shew in some detail that savages pay the greatest attention to their personal appearance. (42. a full and excellent account of the manner in which savages in all parts of the world ornament themselves, is given by the italian traveller, professor mantegazza, 'rio de la plata, viaggi e studi,' 1867, pp. 525-545; all the following statements, when other references are not given, are taken from this work. see, also, waitz, 'introduction to anthropology,' eng. translat. vol. i. 1863, p. 275, et passim. lawrence also gives very full details in his 'lectures on physiology,' 1822. since this chapter was written sir j. lubbock has published his 'origin of civilisation,' 1870, in which there is an interesting chapter on the present subject, and from which (pp. 42, 48) i have taken some facts about savages dyeing their teeth and hair, and piercing their teeth.) that they have a passion for ornament is notorious; and an english philosopher goes so far as to maintain, that clothes were first made for ornament and not for warmth. as professor waitz remarks, "however poor and miserable man is, he finds a pleasure in adorning himself." the extravagance of the naked indians of south america in decorating themselves is shewn "by a man of large stature gaining with difficulty enough by the labour of a fortnight to procure in exchange the chica necessary to paint himself red." (43. humboldt, 'personal narrative,' eng. translat. vol. iv. p. 515; on the imagination shewn in painting the body, p. 522; on modifying the form of the calf of the leg, p. 466.) the ancient barbarians of europe during the reindeer period brought to their caves any brilliant or singular objects which they happened to find. savages at the present day everywhere deck themselves with plumes, necklaces, armlets, ear-rings, etc. they paint themselves in the most diversified manner. "if painted nations," as humboldt observes, "had been examined with the same attention as clothed nations, it would have been perceived that the most fertile imagination and the most mutable caprice have created the fashions of painting, as well as those of garments." in one part of africa the eyelids are coloured black; in another the nails are coloured yellow or purple. in many places the hair is dyed of various tints. in different countries the teeth are stained black, red, blue, etc., and in the malay archipelago it is thought shameful to have white teeth "like those of a dog." not one great country can be named, from the polar regions in the north to new zealand in the south, in which the aborigines do not tattoo themselves. this practice was followed by the jews of old, and by the ancient britons. in africa some of the natives tattoo themselves, but it is a much more common practice to raise protuberances by rubbing salt into incisions made in various parts of the body; and these are considered by the inhabitants of kordofan and darfur "to be great personal attractions." in the arab countries no beauty can be perfect until the cheeks "or temples have been gashed." (44. 'the nile tributaries,' 1867; 'the albert n'yanza,' 1866, vol. i. p. 218.) in south america, as humboldt remarks, "a mother would be accused of culpable indifference towards her children, if she did not employ artificial means to shape the calf of the leg after the fashion of the country." in the old and new worlds the shape of the skull was formerly modified during infancy in the most extraordinary manner, as is still the case in many places, and such deformities are considered ornamental. for instance, the savages of colombia (45. quoted by prichard, 'physical history of mankind,' 4th ed. vol. i. 1851, p. 321.) deem a much flattened head "an essential point of beauty." the hair is treated with especial care in various countries; it is allowed to grow to full length, so as to reach to the ground, or is combed into "a compact frizzled mop, which is the papuan's pride and glory." (46. on the papuans, wallace, 'the malay archipelago,' vol. ii. p. 445. on the coiffure of the africans, sir s. baker, 'the albert n'yanza,' vol. i. p. 210.) in northern africa "a man requires a period of from eight to ten years to perfect his coiffure." with other nations the head is shaved, and in parts of south america and africa even the eyebrows and eyelashes are eradicated. the natives of the upper nile knock out the four front teeth, saying that they do not wish to resemble brutes. further south, the batokas knock out only the two upper incisors, which, as livingstone (47. 'travels,' p. 533.) remarks, gives the face a hideous appearance, owing to the prominence of the lower jaw; but these people think the presence of the incisors most unsightly, and on beholding some europeans, cried out, "look at the great teeth!" the chief sebituani tried in vain to alter this fashion. in various parts of africa and in the malay archipelago the natives file the incisors into points like those of a saw, or pierce them with holes, into which they insert studs. as the face with us is chiefly admired for its beauty, so with savages it is the chief seat of mutilation. in all quarters of the world the septum, and more rarely the wings of the nose are pierced; rings, sticks, feathers, and other ornaments being inserted into the holes. the ears are everywhere pierced and similarly ornamented, and with the botocudos and lenguas of south america the hole is gradually so much enlarged that the lower edge touches the shoulder. in north and south america and in africa either the upper or lower lip is pierced; and with the botocudos the hole in the lower lip is so large that a disc of wood, four inches in diameter, is placed in it. mantegazza gives a curious account of the shame felt by a south american native, and of the ridicule which he excited, when he sold his tembeta,--the large coloured piece of wood which is passed through the hole. in central africa the women perforate the lower lip and wear a crystal, which, from the movement of the tongue, has "a wriggling motion, indescribably ludicrous during conversation." the wife of the chief of latooka told sir s. baker (49. 'the albert n'yanza,' 1866, vol. i. p. 217.) that lady baker "would be much improved if she would extract her four front teeth from the lower jaw, and wear the long pointed polished crystal in her under lip." further south with the makalolo, the upper lip is perforated, and a large metal and bamboo ring, called a pelele, is worn in the hole. "this caused the lip in one case to project two inches beyond the tip of the nose; and when the lady smiled, the contraction of the muscles elevated it over the eyes. 'why do the women wear these things?' the venerable chief, chinsurdi, was asked. evidently surprised at such a stupid question, he replied, 'for beauty! they are the only beautiful things women have; men have beards, women have none. what kind of a person would she be without the pelele? she would not be a woman at all with a mouth like a man, but no beard.'" (49. livingstone, 'british association,' 1860; report given in the 'athenaeum,' july 7, 1860, p. 29.) hardly any part of the body, which can be unnaturally modified, has escaped. the amount of suffering thus caused must have been extreme, for many of the operations require several years for their completion, so that the idea of their necessity must be imperative. the motives are various; the men paint their bodies to make themselves appear terrible in battle; certain mutilations are connected with religious rites, or they mark the age of puberty, or the rank of the man, or they serve to distinguish the tribes. amongst savages the same fashions prevail for long periods (50. sir s. baker (ibid. vol. i. p. 210) speaking of the natives of central africa says, "every tribe has a distinct and unchanging fashion for dressing the hair." see agassiz ('journey in brazil,' 1868, p. 318) on invariability of the tattooing of amazonian indians.), and thus mutilations, from whatever cause first made, soon come to be valued as distinctive marks. but self-adornment, vanity, and the admiration of others, seem to be the commonest motives. in regard to tattooing, i was told by the missionaries in new zealand that when they tried to persuade some girls to give up the practice, they answered, "we must just have a few lines on our lips; else when we grow old we shall be so very ugly." with the men of new zealand, a most capable judge (51. rev. r. taylor, 'new zealand and its inhabitants,' 1855, p. 152.) says, "to have fine tattooed faces was the great ambition of the young, both to render themselves attractive to the ladies, and conspicuous in war." a star tattooed on the forehead and a spot on the chin are thought by the women in one part of africa to be irresistible attractions. (52. mantegazza, 'viaggi e studi,' p. 542.) in most, but not all parts of the world, the men are more ornamented than the women, and often in a different manner; sometimes, though rarely, the women are hardly at all ornamented. as the women are made by savages to perform the greatest share of the work, and as they are not allowed to eat the best kinds of food, so it accords with the characteristic selfishness of man that they should not be allowed to obtain, or use the finest ornaments. lastly, it is a remarkable fact, as proved by the foregoing quotations, that the same fashions in modifying the shape of the head, in ornamenting the hair, in painting, tattooing, in perforating the nose, lips, or ears, in removing or filing the teeth, etc., now prevail, and have long prevailed, in the most distant quarters of the world. it is extremely improbable that these practices, followed by so many distinct nations, should be due to tradition from any common source. they indicate the close similarity of the mind of man, to whatever race he may belong, just as do the almost universal habits of dancing, masquerading, and making rude pictures. having made these preliminary remarks on the admiration felt by savages for various ornaments, and for deformities most unsightly in our eyes, let us see how far the men are attracted by the appearance of their women, and what are their ideas of beauty. i have heard it maintained that savages are quite indifferent about the beauty of their women, valuing them solely as slaves; it may therefore be well to observe that this conclusion does not at all agree with the care which the women take in ornamenting themselves, or with their vanity. burchell (53. 'travels in south africa,' 1824, vol. i. p. 414.) gives an amusing account of a bush-woman who used as much grease, red ochre, and shining powder "as would have ruined any but a very rich husband." she displayed also "much vanity and too evident a consciousness of her superiority." mr. winwood reade informs me that the negroes of the west coast often discuss the beauty of their women. some competent observers have attributed the fearfully common practice of infanticide partly to the desire felt by the women to retain their good looks. (54. see, for references, gerland, 'ueber das aussterben der naturvölker,' 1868, ss. 51, 53, 55; also azara, 'voyages,' etc., tom. ii. p. 116.) in several regions the women wear charms and use love-philters to gain the affections of the men; and mr. brown enumerates four plants used for this purpose by the women of north-western america. (55. on the vegetable productions used by the north-western american indians, see 'pharmaceutical journal,' vol. x.) hearne (56. 'a journey from prince of wales fort,' 8vo. ed. 1796, p. 89.), an excellent observer, who lived many years with the american indians, says, in speaking of the women, "ask a northern indian what is beauty, and he will answer, a broad flat face, small eyes, high cheek-bones, three or four broad black lines across each cheek, a low forehead, a large broad chin, a clumsy hook nose, a tawny hide, and breasts hanging down to the belt." pallas, who visited the northern parts of the chinese empire, says, "those women are preferred who have the mandschu form; that is to say, a broad face, high cheek-bones, very broad noses, and enormous ears"(57. quoted by prichard, 'physical history of mankind,' 3rd ed. vol. iv. 1844, p. 519; vogt, 'lectures on man,' eng. translat. p. 129. on the opinion of the chinese on the cingalese, e. tennent, 'ceylon,' 1859, vol. ii. p. 107.); and vogt remarks that the obliquity of the eye, which is proper to the chinese and japanese, is exaggerated in their pictures for the purpose, as it "seems, of exhibiting its beauty, as contrasted with the eye of the red-haired barbarians." it is well known, as huc repeatedly remarks, that the chinese of the interior think europeans hideous, with their white skins and prominent noses. the nose is far from being too prominent, according to our ideas, in the natives of ceylon; yet "the chinese in the seventh century, accustomed to the flat features of the mongol races, were surprised at the prominent noses of the cingalese; and thsang described them as having 'the beak of a bird, with the body of a man.'" finlayson, after minutely describing the people of cochin china, says that their rounded heads and faces are their chief characteristics; and, he adds, "the roundness of the whole countenance is more striking in the women, who are reckoned beautiful in proportion as they display this form of face." the siamese have small noses with divergent nostrils, a wide mouth, rather thick lips, a remarkably large face, with very high and broad cheek-bones. it is, therefore, not wonderful that "beauty, according to our notion, is a stranger to them. yet they consider their own females to be much more beautiful than those of europe." (58. prichard, as taken from crawfurd and finlayson, 'phys. hist. of mankind,' vol. iv. pp. 534, 535.) it is well known that with many hottentot women the posterior part of the body projects in a wonderful manner; they are steatopygous; and sir andrew smith is certain that this peculiarity is greatly admired by the men. (59. idem illustrissimus viator dixit mihi praecinctorium vel tabulam foeminae, quod nobis teterrimum est, quondam permagno aestimari ab hominibus in hac gente. nunc res mutata est, et censent talem conformationem minime optandam esse.) he once saw a woman who was considered a beauty, and she was so immensely developed behind, that when seated on level ground she could not rise, and had to push herself along until she came to a slope. some of the women in various negro tribes have the same peculiarity; and, according to burton, the somal men are said to choose their wives by ranging them in a line, and by picking her out who projects farthest a tergo. nothing can be more hateful to a negro than the opposite form." (60. the 'anthropological review,' november 1864, p. 237. for additional references, see waitz, 'introduction to anthropology,' eng. translat., 1863, vol. i. p. 105.) with respect to colour, the negroes rallied mungo park on the whiteness of his skin and the prominence of his nose, both of which they considered as "unsightly and unnatural conformations." he in return praised the glossy jet of their skins and the lovely depression of their noses; this they said was "honeymouth," nevertheless they gave him food. the african moors, also, "knitted their brows and seemed to shudder" at the whiteness of his skin. on the eastern coast, the negro boys when they saw burton, cried out, "look at the white man; does he not look like a white ape?" on the western coast, as mr. winwood reade informs me, the negroes admire a very black skin more than one of a lighter tint. but their horror of whiteness may be attributed, according to this same traveller, partly to the belief held by most negroes that demons and spirits are white, and partly to their thinking it a sign of ill-health. the banyai of the more southern part of the continent are negroes, but "a great many of them are of a light coffee-and-milk colour, and, indeed, this colour is considered handsome throughout the whole country"; so that here we have a different standard of taste. with the kaffirs, who differ much from negroes, "the skin, except among the tribes near delagoa bay, is not usually black, the prevailing colour being a mixture of black and red, the most common shade being chocolate. dark complexions, as being most common, are naturally held in the highest esteem. to be told that he is light- coloured, or like a white man, would be deemed a very poor compliment by a kaffir. i have heard of one unfortunate man who was so very fair that no girl would marry him." one of the titles of the zulu king is, "you who are black." (61. mungo park's 'travels in africa,' 4to. 1816, pp. 53, 131. burton's statement is quoted by schaaffhausen, 'archiv. fur anthropologie,' 1866, s. 163. on the banyai, livingstone, 'travels,' p. 64. on the kaffirs, the rev. j. shooter, 'the kafirs of natal and the zulu country,' 1857, p. 1.) mr. galton, in speaking to me about the natives of s. africa, remarked that their ideas of beauty seem very different from ours; for in one tribe two slim, slight, and pretty girls were not admired by the natives. turning to other quarters of the world; in java, a yellow, not a white girl, is considered, according to madame pfeiffer, a beauty. a man of cochin china "spoke with contempt of the wife of the english ambassador, that she had white teeth like a dog, and a rosy colour like that of potato- flowers." we have seen that the chinese dislike our white skin, and that the n. americans admire "a tawny hide." in s. america, the yuracaras, who inhabit the wooded, damp slopes of the eastern cordillera, are remarkably pale-coloured, as their name in their own language expresses; nevertheless they consider european women as very inferior to their own. (62. for the javans and cochin-chinese, see waitz, 'introduct. to anthropology,' eng. translat. vol. i. p. 305. on the yuracaras, a. d'orbigny, as quoted in prichard, 'physical history of mankind,' vol. v. 3rd ed. p. 476.) in several of the tribes of north america the hair on the head grows to a wonderful length; and catlin gives a curious proof how much this is esteemed, for the chief of the crows was elected to this office from having the longest hair of any man in the tribe, namely ten feet and seven inches. the aymaras and quichuas of s. america, likewise have very long hair; and this, as mr. d. forbes informs me, is so much valued as a beauty, that cutting it off was the severest punishment which he could inflict on them. in both the northern and southern halves of the continent the natives sometimes increase the apparent length of their hair by weaving into it fibrous substances. although the hair on the head is thus cherished, that on the face is considered by the north american indians "as very vulgar," and every hair is carefully eradicated. this practice prevails throughout the american continent from vancouver's island in the north to tierra del fuego in the south. when york minster, a fuegian on board the "beagle," was taken back to his country, the natives told him be ought to pull out the few short hairs on his face. they also threatened a young missionary, who was left for a time with them, to strip him naked, and pluck the hair from his face and body, yet he was far from being a hairy man. this fashion is carried so far that the indians of paraguay eradicate their eyebrows and eyelashes, saying that they do not wish to be like horses. (63. 'north american indians,' by g. catlin, 3rd ed., 1842, vol. i. p. 49; vol. ii, p. 227. on the natives of vancouver's island, see sproat, 'scenes and studies of savage life,' 1868, p. 25. on the indians of paraguay, azara, 'voyages,' tom. ii. p. 105.) it is remarkable that throughout the world the races which are almost completely destitute of a beard dislike hairs on the face and body, and take pains to eradicate them. the kalmucks are beardless, and they are well known, like the americans, to pluck out all straggling hairs; and so it is with the polynesians, some of the malays, and the siamese. mr. veitch states that the japanese ladies "all objected to our whiskers, considering them very ugly, and told us to cut them off, and be like japanese men." the new zealanders have short, curled beards; yet they formerly plucked out the hairs on the face. they had a saying that "there is no woman for a hairy man;" but it would appear that the fashion has changed in new zealand, perhaps owing to the presence of europeans, and i am assured that beards are now admired by the maories. (64. on the siamese, prichard, ibid. vol. iv. p. 533. on the japanese, veitch in 'gardeners' chronicle,' 1860, p. 1104. on the new zealanders, mantegazza, 'viaggi e studi,' 1867, p. 526. for the other nations mentioned, see references in lawrence, 'lectures on physiology,' etc., 1822, p. 272.) on the other hand, bearded races admire and greatly value their beards; among the anglo-saxons every part of the body had a recognised value; "the loss of the beard being estimated at twenty shillings, while the breaking of a thigh was fixed at only twelve." (65. lubbock, 'origin of civilisation,' 1870, p. 321.) in the east men swear solemnly by their beards. we have seen that chinsurdi, the chief of the makalolo in africa, thought that beards were a great ornament. in the pacific the fijian's beard is "profuse and bushy, and is his greatest pride"; whilst the inhabitants of the adjacent archipelagoes of tonga and samoa are "beardless, and abhor a rough chin." in one island alone of the ellice group "the men are heavily bearded, and not a little proud thereof." (66. dr. barnard davis quotes mr. prichard and others for these facts in regard to the polynesians, in 'anthropolog. review,' april 1870, pp. 185, 191.) we thus see how widely the different races of man differ in their taste for the beautiful. in every nation sufficiently advanced to have made effigies of their gods or of their deified rulers, the sculptors no doubt have endeavoured to express their highest ideal of beauty and grandeur. (67. ch. comte has remarks to this effect in his 'traité de législation,' 3rd ed. 1837, p. 136.) under this point of view it is well to compare in our mind the jupiter or apollo of the greeks with the egyptian or assyrian statues; and these with the hideous bas-reliefs on the ruined buildings of central america. i have met with very few statements opposed to this conclusion. mr. winwood reade, however, who has had ample opportunities for observation, not only with the negroes of the west coast of africa, but with those of the interior who have never associated with europeans, is convinced that their ideas of beauty are on the whole the same as ours; and dr. rohlfs writes to me to the same effect with respect to bornu and the countries inhabited by the pullo tribes. mr. reade found that he agreed with the negroes in their estimation of the beauty of the native girls; and that their appreciation of the beauty of european women corresponded with ours. they admire long hair, and use artificial means to make it appear abundant; they admire also a beard, though themselves very scantily provided. mr. reade feels doubtful what kind of nose is most appreciated; a girl has been heard to say, "i do not want to marry him, he has got no nose"; and this shews that a very flat nose is not admired. we should, however, bear in mind that the depressed, broad noses and projecting jaws of the negroes of the west coast are exceptional types with the inhabitants of africa. notwithstanding the foregoing statements, mr. reade admits that negroes "do not like the colour of our skin; they look on blue eyes with aversion, and they think our noses too long and our lips too thin." he does not think it probable that negroes would ever prefer the most beautiful european woman, on the mere grounds of physical admiration, to a good-looking negress. (68. the 'african sketch book,' vol. ii. 1873, pp. 253, 394, 521. the fuegians, as i have been informed by a missionary who long resided with them, consider european women as extremely beautiful; but from what we have seen of the judgment of the other aborigines of america, i cannot but think that this must be a mistake, unless indeed the statement refers to the few fuegians who have lived for some time with europeans, and who must consider us as superior beings. i should add that a most experienced observer, capt. burton, believes that a woman whom we consider beautiful is admired throughout the world. 'anthropological review,' march, 1864, p. 245.) the general truth of the principle, long ago insisted on by humboldt (69. 'personal narrative,' eng. translat. vol. iv. p. 518, and elsewhere. mantegazza, in his 'viaggi e studi,' strongly insists on this same principle.), that man admires and often tries to exaggerate whatever characters nature may have given him, is shewn in many ways. the practice of beardless races extirpating every trace of a beard, and often all the hairs on the body affords one illustration. the skull has been greatly modified during ancient and modern times by many nations; and there can be little doubt that this has been practised, especially in n. and s. america, in order to exaggerate some natural and admired peculiarity. many american indians are known to admire a head so extremely flattened as to appear to us idiotic. the natives on the north-western coast compress the head into a pointed cone; and it is their constant practice to gather the hair into a knot on the top of the head, for the sake, as dr. wilson remarks, "of increasing the apparent elevation of the favourite conoid form." the inhabitants of arakhan admire a broad, smooth forehead, and in order to produce it, they fasten a plate of lead on the heads of the new-born children. on the other hand, "a broad, well-rounded occiput is considered a great beauty" by the natives of the fiji islands. (70. on the skulls of the american tribes, see nott and gliddon, 'types of mankind,' 1854, p. 440; prichard, 'physical history of mankind,' vol. i. 3rd ed. p. 321; on the natives of arakhan, ibid. vol. iv. p. 537. wilson, 'physical ethnology,' smithsonian institution, 1863, p. 288; on the fijians, p. 290. sir j. lubbock ('prehistoric times,' 2nd ed. 1869, p. 506) gives an excellent resume on this subject.) as with the skull, so with the nose; the ancient huns during the age of attila were accustomed to flatten the noses of their infants with bandages, "for the sake of exaggerating a natural conformation." with the tahitians, to be called long-nose is considered as an insult, and they compress the noses and foreheads of their children for the sake of beauty. the same holds with the malays of sumatra, the hottentots, certain negroes, and the natives of brazil. (71. on the huns, godron, 'de l'espèce,' tom. ii. 1859, p. 300. on the tahitians, waitz, 'anthropology,' eng. translat. vol. i. p. 305. marsden, quoted by prichard, 'phys. hist. of mankind,' 3rd edit. vol. v. p. 67. lawrence, 'lectures on physiology,' p. 337.) the chinese have by nature unusually small feet (72. this fact was ascertained in the 'reise der novara: anthropolog. theil.' dr. weisbach, 1867, s. 265.); and it is well known that the women of the upper classes distort their feet to make them still smaller. lastly, humboldt thinks that the american indians prefer colouring their bodies with red paint in order to exaggerate their natural tint; and until recently european women added to their naturally bright colours by rouge and white cosmetics; but it may be doubted whether barbarous nations have generally had any such intention in painting themselves. in the fashions of our own dress we see exactly the same principle and the same desire to carry every point to an extreme; we exhibit, also, the same spirit of emulation. but the fashions of savages are far more permanent than ours; and whenever their bodies are artificially modified, this is necessarily the case. the arab women of the upper nile occupy about three days in dressing their hair; they never imitate other tribes, "but simply vie with each other in the superlativeness of their own style." dr. wilson, in speaking of the compressed skulls of various american races, adds, "such usages are among the least eradicable, and long survive the shock of revolutions that change dynasties and efface more important national peculiarities." (73. 'smithsonian institution,' 1863, p. 289. on the fashions of arab women, sir s. baker, 'the nile tributaries,' 1867, p. 121.) the same principle comes into play in the art of breeding; and we can thus understand, as i have elsewhere explained (74. the 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. i. p. 214; vol. ii. p. 240.), the wonderful development of the many races of animals and plants, which have been kept merely for ornament. fanciers always wish each character to be somewhat increased; they do not admire a medium standard; they certainly do not desire any great and abrupt change in the character of their breeds; they admire solely what they are accustomed to, but they ardently desire to see each characteristic feature a little more developed. the senses of man and of the lower animals seem to be so constituted that brilliant colours and certain forms, as well as harmonious and rhythmical sounds, give pleasure and are called beautiful; but why this should be so we know not. it is certainly not true that there is in the mind of man any universal standard of beauty with respect to the human body. it is, however, possible that certain tastes may in the course of time become inherited, though there is no evidence in favour of this belief: and if so, each race would possess its own innate ideal standard of beauty. it has been argued (75. schaaffhausen, 'archiv. für anthropologie,' 1866, s. 164.) that ugliness consists in an approach to the structure of the lower animals, and no doubt this is partly true with the more civilised nations, in which intellect is highly appreciated; but this explanation will hardly apply to all forms of ugliness. the men of each race prefer what they are accustomed to; they cannot endure any great change; but they like variety, and admire each characteristic carried to a moderate extreme. (76. mr. bain has collected ('mental and moral science,' 1868, pp. 304-314) about a dozen more or less different theories of the idea of beauty; but none is quite the same as that here given.) men accustomed to a nearly oval face, to straight and regular features, and to bright colours, admire, as we europeans know, these points when strongly developed. on the other hand, men accustomed to a broad face, with high cheek-bones, a depressed nose, and a black skin, admire these peculiarities when strongly marked. no doubt characters of all kinds may be too much developed for beauty. hence a perfect beauty, which implies many characters modified in a particular manner, will be in every race a prodigy. as the great anatomist bichat long ago said, if every one were cast in the same mould, there would be no such thing as beauty. if all our women were to become as beautiful as the venus de' medici, we should for a time be charmed; but we should soon wish for variety; and as soon as we had obtained variety, we should wish to see certain characters a little exaggerated beyond the then existing common standard. chapter xx. secondary sexual characters of man--continued. on the effects of the continued selection of women according to a different standard of beauty in each race--on the causes which interfere with sexual selection in civilised and savage nations--conditions favourable to sexual selection during primeval times--on the manner of action of sexual selection with mankind--on the women in savage tribes having some power to choose their husbands--absence of hair on the body, and development of the beard--colour of the skin--summary. we have seen in the last chapter that with all barbarous races ornaments, dress, and external appearance are highly valued; and that the men judge of the beauty of their women by widely different standards. we must next inquire whether this preference and the consequent selection during many generations of those women, which appear to the men of each race the most attractive, has altered the character either of the females alone, or of both sexes. with mammals the general rule appears to be that characters of all kinds are inherited equally by the males and females; we might therefore expect that with mankind any characters gained by the females or by the males through sexual selection would commonly be transferred to the offspring of both sexes. if any change has thus been effected, it is almost certain that the different races would be differently modified, as each has its own standard of beauty. with mankind, especially with savages, many causes interfere with the action of sexual selection as far as the bodily frame is concerned. civilised men are largely attracted by the mental charms of women, by their wealth, and especially by their social position; for men rarely marry into a much lower rank. the men who succeed in obtaining the more beautiful women will not have a better chance of leaving a long line of descendants than other men with plainer wives, save the few who bequeath their fortunes according to primogeniture. with respect to the opposite form of selection, namely, of the more attractive men by the women, although in civilised nations women have free or almost free choice, which is not the case with barbarous races, yet their choice is largely influenced by the social position and wealth of the men; and the success of the latter in life depends much on their intellectual powers and energy, or on the fruits of these same powers in their forefathers. no excuse is needed for treating this subject in some detail; for, as the german philosopher schopenhauer remarks, "the final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. what it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation...it is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake." (1. 'schopenhauer and darwinism,' in 'journal of anthropology,' jan. 1871, p. 323. there is, however, reason to believe that in certain civilised and semi- civilised nations sexual selection has effected something in modifying the bodily frame of some of the members. many persons are convinced, as it appears to me with justice, that our aristocracy, including under this term all wealthy families in which primogeniture has long prevailed, from having chosen during many generations from all classes the more beautiful women as their wives, have become handsomer, according to the european standard, than the middle classes; yet the middle classes are placed under equally favourable conditions of life for the perfect development of the body. cook remarks that the superiority in personal appearance "which is observable in the erees or nobles in all the other islands (of the pacific) is found in the sandwich islands"; but this may be chiefly due to their better food and manner of life. the old traveller chardin, in describing the persians, says their "blood is now highly refined by frequent intermixtures with the georgians and circassians, two nations which surpass all the world in personal beauty. there is hardly a man of rank in persia who is not born of a georgian or circassian mother." he adds that they inherit their beauty, "not from their ancestors, for without the above mixture, the men of rank in persia, who are descendants of the tartars, would be extremely ugly." (2. these quotations are taken from lawrence ('lectures on physiology,' etc., 1822, p. 393), who attributes the beauty of the upper classes in england to the men having long selected the more beautiful women.) here is a more curious case; the priestesses who attended the temple of venus erycina at san- giuliano in sicily, were selected for their beauty out of the whole of greece; they were not vestal virgins, and quatrefages (3. 'anthropologie,' 'revue des cours scientifiques,' oct. 1868, p. 721.), who states the foregoing fact, says that the women of san-giuliano are now famous as the most beautiful in the island, and are sought by artists as models. but it is obvious that the evidence in all the above cases is doubtful. the following case, though relating to savages, is well worth giving for its curiosity. mr. winwood reade informs me that the jollofs, a tribe of negroes on the west coast of africa, "are remarkable for their uniformly fine appearance." a friend of his asked one of these men, "how is it that every one whom i meet is so fine looking, not only your men but your women?" the jollof answered, "it is very easily explained: it has always been our custom to pick out our worst-looking slaves and to sell them." it need hardly be added that with all savages, female slaves serve as concubines. that this negro should have attributed, whether rightly or wrongly, the fine appearance of his tribe to the long-continued elimination of the ugly women is not so surprising as it may at first appear; for i have elsewhere shewn (4. 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. i. p. 207.) that negroes fully appreciate the importance of selection in the breeding of their domestic animals, and i could give from mr. reade additional evidence on this head. the causes which prevent or check the action of sexual selection with savages. the chief causes are, first, so-called communal marriages or promiscuous intercourse; secondly, the consequences of female infanticide; thirdly, early betrothals; and lastly, the low estimation in which women are held, as mere slaves. these four points must be considered in some detail. it is obvious that as long as the pairing of man, or of any other animal, is left to mere chance, with no choice exerted by either sex, there can be no sexual selection; and no effect will be produced on the offspring by certain individuals having had an advantage over others in their courtship. now it is asserted that there exist at the present day tribes which practise what sir j. lubbock by courtesy calls communal marriages; that is, all the men and women in the tribe are husbands and wives to one another. the licentiousness of many savages is no doubt astonishing, but it seems to me that more evidence is requisite, before we fully admit that their intercourse is in any case promiscuous. nevertheless all those who have most closely studied the subject (5. sir j. lubbock, 'the origin of civilisation,' 1870, chap. iii. especially pp. 60-67. mr. m'lennan, in his extremely valuable work on 'primitive marriage,' 1865, p. 163, speaks of the union of the sexes "in the earliest times as loose, transitory, and in some degree promiscuous." mr. m'lennan and sir j. lubbock have collected much evidence on the extreme licentiousness of savages at the present time. mr. l.h. morgan, in his interesting memoir of the classificatory system of relationship. ('proceedings of the american academy of sciences,' vol. vii. feb. 1868, p. 475), concludes that polygamy and all forms of marriage during primeval times were essentially unknown. it appears also, from sir j. lubbock's work, that bachofen likewise believes that communal intercourse originally prevailed.), and whose judgment is worth much more than mine, believe that communal marriage (this expression being variously guarded) was the original and universal form throughout the world, including therein the intermarriage of brothers and sisters. the late sir a. smith, who had travelled widely in s. africa, and knew much about the habits of savages there and elsewhere, expressed to me the strongest opinion that no race exists in which woman is considered as the property of the community. i believe that his judgment was largely determined by what is implied by the term marriage. throughout the following discussion i use the term in the same sense as when naturalists speak of animals as monogamous, meaning thereby that the male is accepted by or chooses a single female, and lives with her either during the breeding-season or for the whole year, keeping possession of her by the law of might; or, as when they speak of a polygamous species, meaning that the male lives with several females. this kind of marriage is all that concerns us here, as it suffices for the work of sexual selection. but i know that some of the writers above referred to imply by the term marriage a recognised right protected by the tribe. the indirect evidence in favour of the belief of the former prevalence of communal marriages is strong, and rests chiefly on the terms of relationship which are employed between the members of the same tribe, implying a connection with the tribe, and not with either parent. but the subject is too large and complex for even an abstract to be here given, and i will confine myself to a few remarks. it is evident in the case of such marriages, or where the marriage tie is very loose, that the relationship of the child to its father cannot be known. but it seems almost incredible that the relationship of the child to its mother should ever be completely ignored, especially as the women in most savage tribes nurse their infants for a long time. accordingly, in many cases the lines of descent are traced through the mother alone, to the exclusion of the father. but in other cases the terms employed express a connection with the tribe alone, to the exclusion even of the mother. it seems possible that the connection between the related members of the same barbarous tribe, exposed to all sorts of danger, might be so much more important, owing to the need of mutual protection and aid, than that between the mother and her child, as to lead to the sole use of terms expressive of the former relationships; but mr. morgan is convinced that this view is by no means sufficient. the terms of relationship used in different parts of the world may be divided, according to the author just quoted, into two great classes, the classificatory and descriptive, the latter being employed by us. it is the classificatory system which so strongly leads to the belief that communal and other extremely loose forms of marriage were originally universal. but as far as i can see, there is no necessity on this ground for believing in absolutely promiscuous intercourse; and i am glad to find that this is sir j. lubbock's view. men and women, like many of the lower animals, might formerly have entered into strict though temporary unions for each birth, and in this case nearly as much confusion would have arisen in the terms of relationship as in the case of promiscuous intercourse. as far as sexual selection is concerned, all that is required is that choice should be exerted before the parents unite, and it signifies little whether the unions last for life or only for a season. besides the evidence derived from the terms of relationship, other lines of reasoning indicate the former wide prevalence of communal marriage. sir j. lubbock accounts for the strange and widely-extended habit of exogamy--that is, the men of one tribe taking wives from a distinct tribe,--by communism having been the original form of intercourse; so that a man never obtained a wife for himself unless he captured her from a neighbouring and hostile tribe, and then she would naturally have become his sole and valuable property. thus the practice of capturing wives might have arisen; and from the honour so gained it might ultimately have become the universal habit. according to sir j. lubbock (6. 'address to british association on the social and religious condition of the lower races of man,' 1870, p. 20.), we can also thus understand "the necessity of expiation for marriage as an infringement of tribal rites, since according to old ideas, a man had no right to appropriate to himself that which belonged to the whole tribe." sir j. lubbock further gives a curious body of facts shewing that in old times high honour was bestowed on women who were utterly licentious; and this, as he explains, is intelligible, if we admit that promiscuous intercourse was the aboriginal, and therefore long revered custom of the tribe. (7. 'origin of civilisation,' 1870, p. 86. in the several works above quoted, there will be found copious evidence on relationship through the females alone, or with the tribe alone.) although the manner of development of the marriage tie is an obscure subject, as we may infer from the divergent opinions on several points between the three authors who have studied it most closely, namely, mr. morgan, mr. m'lennan, and sir j. lubbock, yet from the foregoing and several other lines of evidence it seems probable (8. mr. c. staniland wake argues strongly ('anthropologia,' march, 1874, p. 197) against the views held by these three writers on the former prevalence of almost promiscuous intercourse; and he thinks that the classificatory system of relationship can be otherwise explained.) that the habit of marriage, in any strict sense of the word, has been gradually developed; and that almost promiscuous or very loose intercourse was once extremely common throughout the world. nevertheless, from the strength of the feeling of jealousy all through the animal kingdom, as well as from the analogy of the lower animals, more particularly of those which come nearest to man, i cannot believe that absolutely promiscuous intercourse prevailed in times past, shortly before man attained to his present rank in the zoological scale. man, as i have attempted to shew, is certainly descended from some ape-like creature. with the existing quadrumana, as far as their habits are known, the males of some species are monogamous, but live during only a part of the year with the females: of this the orang seems to afford an instance. several kinds, for example some of the indian and american monkeys, are strictly monogamous, and associate all the year round with their wives. others are polygamous, for example the gorilla and several american species, and each family lives separate. even when this occurs, the families inhabiting the same district are probably somewhat social; the chimpanzee, for instance, is occasionally met with in large bands. again, other species are polygamous, but several males, each with his own females, live associated in a body, as with several species of baboons. (9. brehm ('thierleben,' b. i. p. 77) says cynocephalus hamadryas lives in great troops containing twice as many adult females as adult males. see rengger on american polygamous species, and owen ('anatomy of vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 746) on american monogamous species. other references might be added.) we may indeed conclude from what we know of the jealousy of all male quadrupeds, armed, as many of them are, with special weapons for battling with their rivals, that promiscuous intercourse in a state of nature is extremely improbable. the pairing may not last for life, but only for each birth; yet if the males which are the strongest and best able to defend or otherwise assist their females and young, were to select the more attractive females, this would suffice for sexual selection. therefore, looking far enough back in the stream of time, and judging from the social habits of man as he now exists, the most probable view is that he aboriginally lived in small communities, each with a single wife, or if powerful with several, whom he jealously guarded against all other men. or he may not have been a social animal, and yet have lived with several wives, like the gorilla; for all the natives "agree that but one adult male is seen in a band; when the young male grows up, a contest takes place for mastery, and the strongest, by killing and driving out the others, establishes himself as the head of the community." (10. dr. savage, in 'boston journal of natural history,' vol. v. 1845-47, p. 423.) the younger males, being thus expelled and wandering about, would, when at last successful in finding a partner, prevent too close interbreeding within the limits of the same family. although savages are now extremely licentious, and although communal marriages may formerly have largely prevailed, yet many tribes practise some form of marriage, but of a far more lax nature than that of civilised nations. polygamy, as just stated, is almost universally followed by the leading men in every tribe. nevertheless there are tribes, standing almost at the bottom of the scale, which are strictly monogamous. this is the case with the veddahs of ceylon: they have a saying, according to sir j. lubbock (11. 'prehistoric times,' 1869, p. 424.), "that death alone can separate husband and wife." an intelligent kandyan chief, of course a polygamist, "was perfectly scandalised at the utter barbarism of living with only one wife, and never parting until separated by death." it was, he said, "just like the wanderoo monkeys." whether savages who now enter into some form of marriage, either polygamous or monogamous, have retained this habit from primeval times, or whether they have returned to some form of marriage, after passing through a stage of promiscuous intercourse, i will not pretend to conjecture. infanticide. this practice is now very common throughout the world, and there is reason to believe that it prevailed much more extensively during former times. (12. mr. m'lennan, 'primitive marriage,' 1865. see especially on exogamy and infanticide, pp. 130, 138, 165.) barbarians find it difficult to support themselves and their children, and it is a simple plan to kill their infants. in south america some tribes, according to azara, formerly destroyed so many infants of both sexes that they were on the point of extinction. in the polynesian islands women have been known to kill from four or five, to even ten of their children; and ellis could not find a single woman who had not killed at least one. in a village on the eastern frontier of india colonel macculloch found not a single female child. wherever infanticide (13. dr. gerland ('ueber das aussterben der naturvölker,' 1868) has collected much information on infanticide, see especially ss. 27, 51, 54. azara ('voyages,' etc., tom. ii. pp. 94, 116) enters in detail on the motives. see also m'lennan (ibid. p. 139) for cases in india. in the former reprints of the 2nd edition of this book an incorrect quotation from sir g. grey was unfortunately given in the above passage and has now been removed from the text.) prevails the struggle for existence will be in so far less severe, and all the members of the tribe will have an almost equally good chance of rearing their few surviving children. in most cases a larger number of female than of male infants are destroyed, for it is obvious that the latter are of more value to the tribe, as they will, when grown up, aid in defending it, and can support themselves. but the trouble experienced by the women in rearing children, their consequent loss of beauty, the higher estimation set on them when few, and their happier fate, are assigned by the women themselves, and by various observers, as additional motives for infanticide. when, owing to female infanticide, the women of a tribe were few, the habit of capturing wives from neighbouring tribes would naturally arise. sir j. lubbock, however, as we have seen, attributes the practice in chief part to the former existence of communal marriage, and to the men having consequently captured women from other tribes to hold as their sole property. additional causes might be assigned, such as the communities being very small, in which case, marriageable women would often be deficient. that the habit was most extensively practised during former times, even by the ancestors of civilised nations, is clearly shewn by the preservation of many curious customs and ceremonies, of which mr. m'lennan has given an interesting account. in our own marriages the "best man" seems originally to have been the chief abettor of the bridegroom in the act of capture. now as long as men habitually procured their wives through violence and craft, they would have been glad to seize on any woman, and would not have selected the more attractive ones. but as soon as the practice of procuring wives from a distinct tribe was effected through barter, as now occurs in many places, the more attractive women would generally have been purchased. the incessant crossing, however, between tribe and tribe, which necessarily follows from any form of this habit, would tend to keep all the people inhabiting the same country nearly uniform in character; and this would interfere with the power of sexual selection in differentiating the tribes. the scarcity of women, consequent on female infanticide, leads, also, to another practice, that of polyandry, still common in several parts of the world, and which formerly, as mr. m'lennan believes, prevailed almost universally: but this latter conclusion is doubted by mr. morgan and sir j. lubbock. (14. 'primitive marriage,' p. 208; sir j. lubbock, 'origin of civilisation,' p. 100. see also mr. morgan, loc. cit., on the former prevalence of polyandry.) whenever two or more men are compelled to marry one woman, it is certain that all the women of the tribe will get married, and there will be no selection by the men of the more attractive women. but under these circumstances the women no doubt will have the power of choice, and will prefer the more attractive men. azara, for instance, describes how carefully a guana woman bargains for all sorts of privileges, before accepting some one or more husbands; and the men in consequence take unusual care of their personal appearance. so amongst the todas of india, who practise polyandry, the girls can accept or refuse any man. (15. azara, 'voyages,' etc., tom. ii. pp. 92-95; colonel marshall, 'amongst the todas,' p. 212.) a very ugly man in these cases would perhaps altogether fail in getting a wife, or get one later in life; but the handsomer men, although more successful in obtaining wives, would not, as far as we can see, leave more offspring to inherit their beauty than the less handsome husbands of the same women. early betrothals and slavery of women. with many savages it is the custom to betroth the females whilst mere infants; and this would effectually prevent preference being exerted on either side according to personal appearance. but it would not prevent the more attractive women from being afterwards stolen or taken by force from their husbands by the more powerful men; and this often happens in australia, america, and elsewhere. the same consequences with reference to sexual selection would to a certain extent follow, when women are valued almost solely as slaves or beasts of burden, as is the case with many savages. the men, however, at all times would prefer the handsomest slaves according to their standard of beauty. we thus see that several customs prevail with savages which must greatly interfere with, or completely stop, the action of sexual selection. on the other hand, the conditions of life to which savages are exposed, and some of their habits, are favourable to natural selection; and this comes into play at the same time with sexual selection. savages are known to suffer severely from recurrent famines; they do not increase their food by artificial means; they rarely refrain from marriage (16. burchell says ('travels in s. africa,' vol. ii. 1824, p. 58), that among the wild nations of southern africa, neither men nor women ever pass their lives in a state of celibacy. azara ('voyages dans l'amérique merid.' tom. ii. 1809, p. 21) makes precisely the same remark in regard to the wild indians of south america.), and generally marry whilst young. consequently they must be subjected to occasional hard struggles for existence, and the favoured individuals will alone survive. at a very early period, before man attained to his present rank in the scale, many of his conditions would be different from what now obtains amongst savages. judging from the analogy of the lower animals, he would then either live with a single female, or be a polygamist. the most powerful and able males would succeed best in obtaining attractive females. they would also succeed best in the general struggle for life, and in defending their females, as well as their offspring, from enemies of all kinds. at this early period the ancestors of man would not be sufficiently advanced in intellect to look forward to distant contingencies; they would not foresee that the rearing of all their children, especially their female children, would make the struggle for life severer for the tribe. they would be governed more by their instincts and less by their reason than are savages at the present day. they would not at that period have partially lost one of the strongest of all instincts, common to all the lower animals, namely the love of their young offspring; and consequently they would not have practised female infanticide. women would not have been thus rendered scarce, and polyandry would not have been practised; for hardly any other cause, except the scarcity of women seems sufficient to break down the natural and widely prevalent feeling of jealousy, and the desire of each male to possess a female for himself. polyandry would be a natural stepping-stone to communal marriages or almost promiscuous intercourse; though the best authorities believe that this latter habit preceded polyandry. during primordial times there would be no early betrothals, for this implies foresight. nor would women be valued merely as useful slaves or beasts of burthen. both sexes, if the females as well as the males were permitted to exert any choice, would choose their partners not for mental charms, or property, or social position, but almost solely from external appearance. all the adults would marry or pair, and all the offspring, as far as that was possible, would be reared; so that the struggle for existence would be periodically excessively severe. thus during these times all the conditions for sexual selection would have been more favourable than at a later period, when man had advanced in his intellectual powers but had retrograded in his instincts. therefore, whatever influence sexual selection may have had in producing the differences between the races of man, and between man and the higher quadrumana, this influence would have been more powerful at a remote period than at the present day, though probably not yet wholly lost. the manner of action of sexual selection with mankind. with primeval man under the favourable conditions just stated, and with those savages who at the present time enter into any marriage tie, sexual selection has probably acted in the following manner, subject to greater or less interference from female infanticide, early betrothals, etc. the strongest and most vigorous men--those who could best defend and hunt for their families, who were provided with the best weapons and possessed the most property, such as a large number of dogs or other animals,--would succeed in rearing a greater average number of offspring than the weaker and poorer members of the same tribes. there can, also, be no doubt that such men would generally be able to select the more attractive women. at present the chiefs of nearly every tribe throughout the world succeed in obtaining more than one wife. i hear from mr. mantell that, until recently, almost every girl in new zealand who was pretty, or promised to be pretty, was tapu to some chief. with the kafirs, as mr. c. hamilton states (17. 'anthropological review,' jan. 1870, p. xvi.), "the chiefs generally have the pick of the women for many miles round, and are most persevering in establishing or confirming their privilege." we have seen that each race has its own style of beauty, and we know that it is natural to man to admire each characteristic point in his domestic animals, dress, ornaments, and personal appearance, when carried a little beyond the average. if then the several foregoing propositions be admitted, and i cannot see that they are doubtful, it would be an inexplicable circumstance if the selection of the more attractive women by the more powerful men of each tribe, who would rear on an average a greater number of children, did not after the lapse of many generations somewhat modify the character of the tribe. when a foreign breed of our domestic animals is introduced into a new country, or when a native breed is long and carefully attended to, either for use or ornament, it is found after several generations to have undergone a greater or less amount of change whenever the means of comparison exist. this follows from unconscious selection during a long series of generations--that is, the preservation of the most approved individuals--without any wish or expectation of such a result on the part of the breeder. so again, if during many years two careful breeders rear animals of the same family, and do not compare them together or with a common standard, the animals are found to have become, to the surprise of their owners, slightly different. (18. the 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. pp. 210-217.) each breeder has impressed, as von nathusius well expresses it, the character of his own mind--his own taste and judgment--on his animals. what reason, then, can be assigned why similar results should not follow from the long-continued selection of the most admired women by those men of each tribe who were able to rear the greatest number of children? this would be unconscious selection, for an effect would be produced, independently of any wish or expectation on the part of the men who preferred certain women to others. let us suppose the members of a tribe, practising some form of marriage, to spread over an unoccupied continent, they would soon split up into distinct hordes, separated from each other by various barriers, and still more effectually by the incessant wars between all barbarous nations. the hordes would thus be exposed to slightly different conditions and habits of life, and would sooner or later come to differ in some small degree. as soon as this occurred, each isolated tribe would form for itself a slightly different standard of beauty (19. an ingenious writer argues, from a comparison of the pictures of raphael, rubens, and modern french artists, that the idea of beauty is not absolutely the same even throughout europe: see the 'lives of haydn and mozart,' by bombet (otherwise m. beyle), english translation, p. 278.); and then unconscious selection would come into action through the more powerful and leading men preferring certain women to others. thus the differences between the tribes, at first very slight, would gradually and inevitably be more or less increased. with animals in a state of nature, many characters proper to the males, such as size, strength, special weapons, courage and pugnacity, have been acquired through the law of battle. the semi-human progenitors of man, like their allies the quadrumana, will almost certainly have been thus modified; and, as savages still fight for the possession of their women, a similar process of selection has probably gone on in a greater or less degree to the present day. other characters proper to the males of the lower animals, such as bright colours and various ornaments, have been acquired by the more attractive males having been preferred by the females. there are, however, exceptional cases in which the males are the selectors, instead of having been the selected. we recognise such cases by the females being more highly ornamented than the males,--their ornamental characters having been transmitted exclusively or chiefly to their female offspring. one such case has been described in the order to which man belongs, that of the rhesus monkey. man is more powerful in body and mind than woman, and in the savage state he keeps her in a far more abject state of bondage than does the male of any other animal; therefore it is not surprising that he should have gained the power of selection. women are everywhere conscious of the value of their own beauty; and when they have the means, they take more delight in decorating themselves with all sorts of ornaments than do men. they borrow the plumes of male birds, with which nature has decked this sex, in order to charm the females. as women have long been selected for beauty, it is not surprising that some of their successive variations should have been transmitted exclusively to the same sex; consequently that they should have transmitted beauty in a somewhat higher degree to their female than to their male offspring, and thus have become more beautiful, according to general opinion, than men. women, however, certainly transmit most of their characters, including some beauty, to their offspring of both sexes; so that the continued preference by the men of each race for the more attractive women, according to their standard of taste, will have tended to modify in the same manner all the individuals of both sexes belonging to the race. with respect to the other form of sexual selection (which with the lower animals is much the more common), namely, when the females are the selectors, and accept only those males which excite or charm them most, we have reason to believe that it formerly acted on our progenitors. man in all probability owes his beard, and perhaps some other characters, to inheritance from an ancient progenitor who thus gained his ornaments. but this form of selection may have occasionally acted during later times; for in utterly barbarous tribes the women have more power in choosing, rejecting, and tempting their lovers, or of afterwards changing their husbands, than might have been expected. as this is a point of some importance, i will give in detail such evidence as i have been able to collect. hearne describes how a woman in one of the tribes of arctic america repeatedly ran away from her husband and joined her lover; and with the charruas of s. america, according to azara, divorce is quite optional. amongst the abipones, a man on choosing a wife bargains with the parents about the price. but "it frequently happens that the girl rescinds what has been agreed upon between the parents and the bridegroom, obstinately rejecting the very mention of marriage." she often runs away, hides herself, and thus eludes the bridegroom. captain musters who lived with the patagonians, says that their marriages are always settled by inclination; "if the parents make a match contrary to the daughter's will, she refuses and is never compelled to comply." in tierra del fuego a young man first obtains the consent of the parents by doing them some service, and then he attempts to carry off the girl; "but if she is unwilling, she hides herself in the woods until her admirer is heartily tired of looking for her, and gives up the pursuit; but this seldom happens." in the fiji islands the man seizes on the woman whom he wishes for his wife by actual or pretended force; but "on reaching the home of her abductor, should she not approve of the match, she runs to some one who can protect her; if, however, she is satisfied, the matter is settled forthwith." with the kalmucks there is a regular race between the bride and bridegroom, the former having a fair start; and clarke "was assured that no instance occurs of a girl being caught, unless she has a partiality to the pursuer." amongst the wild tribes of the malay archipelago there is also a racing match; and it appears from m. bourien's account, as sir j. lubbock remarks, that "the race, 'is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong,' but to the young man who has the good fortune to please his intended bride." a similar custom, with the same result, prevails with the koraks of north- eastern asia. turning to africa: the kafirs buy their wives, and girls are severely beaten by their fathers if they will not accept a chosen husband; but it is manifest from many facts given by the rev. mr. shooter, that they have considerable power of choice. thus very ugly, though rich men, have been known to fail in getting wives. the girls, before consenting to be betrothed, compel the men to shew themselves off first in front and then behind, and "exhibit their paces." they have been known to propose to a man, and they not rarely run away with a favoured lover. so again, mr. leslie, who was intimately acquainted with the kafirs, says, "it is a mistake to imagine that a girl is sold by her father in the same manner, and with the same authority, with which he would dispose of a cow." amongst the degraded bushmen of s. africa, "when a girl has grown up to womanhood without having been betrothed, which, however, does not often happen, her lover must gain her approbation, as well as that of the parents." (20. azara, 'voyages,' etc., tom. ii. p. 23. dobrizhoffer, 'an account of the abipones,' vol. ii. 1822, p. 207. capt. musters, in 'proc. r. geograph. soc.' vol. xv. p. 47. williams on the fiji islanders, as quoted by lubbock, 'origin of civilisation,' 1870, p. 79. on the fuegians, king and fitzroy, 'voyages of the "adventure" and "beagle,"' vol. ii. 1839, p. 182. on the kalmucks, quoted by m'lennan, 'primitive marriage,' 1865, p. 32. on the malays, lubbock, ibid. p. 76. the rev. j. shooter, 'on the kafirs of natal,' 1857, pp. 52-60. mr. d. leslie, 'kafir character and customs,' 1871, p. 4. on the bush-men, burchell, 'travels in s. africa,' ii. 1824, p. 59. on the koraks by mckennan, as quoted by mr. wake, in 'anthropologia,' oct. 1873, p. 75.) mr. winwood reade made inquiries for me with respect to the negroes of western africa, and he informs me that "the women, at least among the more intelligent pagan tribes, have no difficulty in getting the husbands whom they may desire, although it is considered unwomanly to ask a man to marry them. they are quite capable of falling in love, and of forming tender, passionate, and faithful attachments." additional cases could be given. we thus see that with savages the women are not in quite so abject a state in relation to marriage as has often been supposed. they can tempt the men whom they prefer, and can sometimes reject those whom they dislike, either before or after marriage. preference on the part of the women, steadily acting in any one direction, would ultimately affect the character of the tribe; for the women would generally choose not merely the handsomest men, according to their standard of taste, but those who were at the same time best able to defend and support them. such well-endowed pairs would commonly rear a larger number of offspring than the less favoured. the same result would obviously follow in a still more marked manner if there was selection on both sides; that is, if the more attractive, and at the same time more powerful men were to prefer, and were preferred by, the more attractive women. and this double form of selection seems actually to have occurred, especially during the earlier periods of our long history. we will now examine a little more closely some of the characters which distinguish the several races of man from one another and from the lower animals, namely, the greater or less deficiency of hair on the body, and the colour of the skin. we need say nothing about the great diversity in the shape of the features and of the skull between the different races, as we have seen in the last chapter how different is the standard of beauty in these respects. these characters will therefore probably have been acted on through sexual selection; but we have no means of judging whether they have been acted on chiefly from the male or female side. the musical faculties of man have likewise been already discussed. absence of hair on the body, and its development on the face and head. from the presence of the woolly hair or lanugo on the human foetus, and of rudimentary hairs scattered over the body during maturity, we may infer that man is descended from some animal which was born hairy and remained so during life. the loss of hair is an inconvenience and probably an injury to man, even in a hot climate, for he is thus exposed to the scorching of the sun, and to sudden chills, especially during wet weather. as mr. wallace remarks, the natives in all countries are glad to protect their naked backs and shoulders with some slight covering. no one supposes that the nakedness of the skin is any direct advantage to man; his body therefore cannot have been divested of hair through natural selection. (21. 'contributions to the theory of natural selection,' 1870, p. 346. mr. wallace believes (p. 350) "that some intelligent power has guided or determined the development of man"; and he considers the hairless condition of the skin as coming under this head. the rev. t.r. stebbing, in commenting on this view ('transactions of devonshire association for science,' 1870) remarks, that had mr. wallace "employed his usual ingenuity on the question of man's hairless skin, he might have seen the possibility of its selection through its superior beauty or the health attaching to superior cleanliness.") nor, as shewn in a former chapter, have we any evidence that this can be due to the direct action of climate, or that it is the result of correlated development. the absence of hair on the body is to a certain extent a secondary sexual character; for in all parts of the world women are less hairy than men. therefore we may reasonably suspect that this character has been gained through sexual selection. we know that the faces of several species of monkeys, and large surfaces at the posterior end of the body of other species, have been denuded of hair; and this we may safely attribute to sexual selection, for these surfaces are not only vividly coloured, but sometimes, as with the male mandrill and female rhesus, much more vividly in the one sex than in the other, especially during the breeding-season. i am informed by mr. bartlett that, as these animals gradually reach maturity, the naked surfaces grow larger compared with the size of their bodies. the hair, however, appears to have been removed, not for the sake of nudity, but that the colour of the skin may be more fully displayed. so again with many birds, it appears as if the head and neck had been divested of feathers through sexual selection, to exhibit the brightly-coloured skin. as the body in woman is less hairy than in man, and as this character is common to all races, we may conclude that it was our female semi-human ancestors who were first divested of hair, and that this occurred at an extremely remote period before the several races had diverged from a common stock. whilst our female ancestors were gradually acquiring this new character of nudity, they must have transmitted it almost equally to their offspring of both sexes whilst young; so that its transmission, as with the ornaments of many mammals and birds, has not been limited either by sex or age. there is nothing surprising in a partial loss of hair having been esteemed as an ornament by our ape-like progenitors, for we have seen that innumerable strange characters have been thus esteemed by animals of all kinds, and have consequently been gained through sexual selection. nor is it surprising that a slightly injurious character should have been thus acquired; for we know that this is the case with the plumes of certain birds, and with the horns of certain stags. the females of some of the anthropoid apes, as stated in a former chapter, are somewhat less hairy on the under surface than the males; and here we have what might have afforded a commencement for the process of denudation. with respect to the completion of the process through sexual selection, it is well to bear in mind the new zealand proverb, "there is no woman for a hairy man." all who have seen photographs of the siamese hairy family will admit how ludicrously hideous is the opposite extreme of excessive hairiness. and the king of siam had to bribe a man to marry the first hairy woman in the family; and she transmitted this character to her young offspring of both sexes. (22. the 'variation of animals and plants under domestication,' vol. ii. 1868, p. 237.) some races are much more hairy than others, especially the males; but it must not be assumed that the more hairy races, such as the european, have retained their primordial condition more completely than the naked races, such as the kalmucks or americans. it is more probable that the hairiness of the former is due to partial reversion; for characters which have been at some former period long inherited are always apt to return. we have seen that idiots are often very hairy, and they are apt to revert in other characters to a lower animal type. it does not appear that a cold climate has been influential in leading to this kind of reversion; excepting perhaps with the negroes, who have been reared during several generations in the united states (23. 'investigations into military and anthropological statistics of american soldiers,' by b.a. gould, 1869, p. 568:--observations were carefully made on the hairiness of 2129 black and coloured soldiers, whilst they were bathing; and by looking to the published table, "it is manifest at a glance that there is but little, if any, difference between the white and the black races in this respect." it is, however, certain that negroes in their native and much hotter land of africa, have remarkably smooth bodies. it should be particularly observed, that both pure blacks and mulattoes were included in the above enumeration; and this is an unfortunate circumstance, as in accordance with a principle, the truth of which i have elsewhere proved, crossed races of man would be eminently liable to revert to the primordial hairy character of their early ape-like progenitors.), and possibly with the ainos, who inhabit the northern islands of the japan archipelago. but the laws of inheritance are so complex that we can seldom understand their action. if the greater hairiness of certain races be the result of reversion, unchecked by any form of selection, its extreme variability, even within the limits of the same race, ceases to be remarkable. (24. hardly any view advanced in this work has met with so much disfavour (see for instance, sprengel, 'die fortschritte des darwinismus,' 1874, p. 80) as the above explanation of the loss of hair in mankind through sexual selection; but none of the opposed arguments seem to me of much weight, in comparison with the facts shewing that the nudity of the skin is to a certain extent a secondary sexual character in man and in some of the quadrumana.) with respect to the beard in man, if we turn to our best guide, the quadrumana, we find beards equally developed in both sexes of many species, but in some, either confined to the males, or more developed in them than in the females. from this fact and from the curious arrangement, as well as the bright colours of the hair about the heads of many monkeys, it is highly probable, as before explained, that the males first acquired their beards through sexual selection as an ornament, transmitting them in most cases, equally or nearly so, to their offspring of both sexes. we know from eschricht (25. 'ueber die richtung der haare am menschlichen körper,' in müller's 'archiv. für anat. und phys.' 1837, s. 40.) that with mankind the female as well as the male foetus is furnished with much hair on the face, especially round the mouth; and this indicates that we are descended from progenitors of whom both sexes were bearded. it appears therefore at first sight probable that man has retained his beard from a very early period, whilst woman lost her beard at the same time that her body became almost completely divested of hair. even the colour of our beards seems to have been inherited from an ape-like progenitor; for when there is any difference in tint between the hair of the head and the beard, the latter is lighter coloured in all monkeys and in man. in those quadrumana in which the male has a larger beard than that of the female, it is fully developed only at maturity, just as with mankind; and it is possible that only the later stages of development have been retained by man. in opposition to this view of the retention of the beard from an early period is the fact of its great variability in different races, and even within the same race; for this indicates reversion,--long lost characters being very apt to vary on re-appearance. nor must we overlook the part which sexual selection may have played in later times; for we know that with savages the men of the beardless races take infinite pains in eradicating every hair from their faces as something odious, whilst the men of the bearded races feel the greatest pride in their beards. the women, no doubt, participate in these feelings, and if so sexual selection can hardly have failed to have effected something in the course of later times. it is also possible that the long-continued habit of eradicating the hair may have produced an inherited effect. dr. brown-sequard has shewn that if certain animals are operated on in a particular manner, their offspring are affected. further evidence could be given of the inheritance of the effects of mutilations; but a fact lately ascertained by mr. salvin (26. on the tail-feathers of motmots, 'proceedings of the zoological society,' 1873, p. 429.) has a more direct bearing on the present question; for he has shewn that the motmots, which are known habitually to bite off the barbs of the two central tail- feathers, have the barbs of these feathers naturally somewhat reduced. (27. mr. sproat has suggested ('scenes and studies of savage life,' 1868, p. 25) this same view. some distinguished ethnologists, amongst others m. gosse of geneva, believe that artificial modifications of the skull tend to be inherited.) nevertheless, with mankind the habit of eradicating the beard and the hairs on the body would probably not have arisen until these had already become by some means reduced. it is difficult to form any judgment as to how the hair on the head became developed to its present great length in many races. eschricht (28. 'ueber die richtung,' ibid. s. 40.) states that in the human foetus the hair on the face during the fifth month is longer than that on the head; and this indicates that our semi-human progenitors were not furnished with long tresses, which must therefore have been a late acquisition. this is likewise indicated by the extraordinary difference in the length of the hair in the different races; in the negro the hair forms a mere curly mat; with us it is of great length, and with the american natives it not rarely reaches to the ground. some species of semnopithecus have their heads covered with moderately long hair, and this probably serves as an ornament and was acquired through sexual selection. the same view may perhaps be extended to mankind, for we know that long tresses are now and were formerly much admired, as may be observed in the works of almost every poet; st. paul says, "if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her;" and we have seen that in north america a chief was elected solely from the length of his hair. colour of the skin. the best kind of evidence that in man the colour of the skin has been modified through sexual selection is scanty; for in most races the sexes do not differ in this respect, and only slightly, as we have seen, in others. we know, however, from the many facts already given that the colour of the skin is regarded by the men of all races as a highly important element in their beauty; so that it is a character which would be likely to have been modified through selection, as has occurred in innumerable instances with the lower animals. it seems at first sight a monstrous supposition that the jet-blackness of the negro should have been gained through sexual selection; but this view is supported by various analogies, and we know that negroes admire their own colour. with mammals, when the sexes differ in colour, the male is often black or much darker than the female; and it depends merely on the form of inheritance whether this or any other tint is transmitted to both sexes or to one alone. the resemblance to a negro in miniature of pithecia satanas with his jet black skin, white rolling eyeballs, and hair parted on the top of the head, is almost ludicrous. the colour of the face differs much more widely in the various kinds of monkeys than it does in the races of man; and we have some reason to believe that the red, blue, orange, almost white and black tints of their skin, even when common to both sexes, as well as the bright colours of their fur, and the ornamental tufts about the head, have all been acquired through sexual selection. as the order of development during growth, generally indicates the order in which the characters of a species have been developed and modified during previous generations; and as the newly- born infants of the various races of man do not differ nearly as much in colour as do the adults, although their bodies are as completely destitute of hair, we have some slight evidence that the tints of the different races were acquired at a period subsequent to the removal of the hair, which must have occurred at a very early period in the history of man. summary. we may conclude that the greater size, strength, courage, pugnacity, and energy of man, in comparison with woman, were acquired during primeval times, and have subsequently been augmented, chiefly through the contests of rival males for the possession of the females. the greater intellectual vigour and power of invention in man is probably due to natural selection, combined with the inherited effects of habit, for the most able men will have succeeded best in defending and providing for themselves and for their wives and offspring. as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits us to judge, it appears that our male ape-like progenitors acquired their beards as an ornament to charm or excite the opposite sex, and transmitted them only to their male offspring. the females apparently first had their bodies denuded of hair, also as a sexual ornament; but they transmitted this character almost equally to both sexes. it is not improbable that the females were modified in other respects for the same purpose and by the same means; so that women have acquired sweeter voices and become more beautiful than men. it deserves attention that with mankind the conditions were in many respects much more favourable for sexual selection, during a very early period, when man had only just attained to the rank of manhood, than during later times. for he would then, as we may safely conclude, have been guided more by his instinctive passions, and less by foresight or reason. he would have jealously guarded his wife or wives. he would not have practised infanticide; nor valued his wives merely as useful slaves; nor have been betrothed to them during infancy. hence we may infer that the races of men were differentiated, as far as sexual selection is concerned, in chief part at a very remote epoch; and this conclusion throws light on the remarkable fact that at the most ancient period, of which we have not as yet any record, the races of man had already come to differ nearly or quite as much as they do at the present day. the views here advanced, on the part which sexual selection has played in the history of man, want scientific precision. he who does not admit this agency in the case of the lower animals, will disregard all that i have written in the later chapters on man. we cannot positively say that this character, but not that, has been thus modified; it has, however, been shewn that the races of man differ from each other and from their nearest allies, in certain characters which are of no service to them in their daily habits of life, and which it is extremely probable would have been modified through sexual selection. we have seen that with the lowest savages the people of each tribe admire their own characteristic qualities,--the shape of the head and face, the squareness of the cheek- bones, the prominence or depression of the nose, the colour of the skin, the length of the hair on the head, the absence of hair on the face and body, or the presence of a great beard, and so forth. hence these and other such points could hardly fail to be slowly and gradually exaggerated, from the more powerful and able men in each tribe, who would succeed in rearing the largest number of offspring, having selected during many generations for their wives the most strongly characterised and therefore most attractive women. for my own part i conclude that of all the causes which have led to the differences in external appearance between the races of man, and to a certain extent between man and the lower animals, sexual selection has been the most efficient. chapter xxi. general summary and conclusion. main conclusion that man is descended from some lower form--manner of development--genealogy of man--intellectual and moral faculties--sexual selection--concluding remarks. a brief summary will be sufficient to recall to the reader's mind the more salient points in this work. many of the views which have been advanced are highly speculative, and some no doubt will prove erroneous; but i have in every case given the reasons which have led me to one view rather than to another. it seemed worth while to try how far the principle of evolution would throw light on some of the more complex problems in the natural history of man. false facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness: and when this is done, one path towards error is closed and the road to truth is often at the same time opened. the main conclusion here arrived at, and now held by many naturalists who are well competent to form a sound judgment, is that man is descended from some less highly organised form. the grounds upon which this conclusion rests will never be shaken, for the close similarity between man and the lower animals in embryonic development, as well as in innumerable points of structure and constitution, both of high and of the most trifling importance,--the rudiments which he retains, and the abnormal reversions to which he is occasionally liable,--are facts which cannot be disputed. they have long been known, but until recently they told us nothing with respect to the origin of man. now when viewed by the light of our knowledge of the whole organic world, their meaning is unmistakable. the great principle of evolution stands up clear and firm, when these groups or facts are considered in connection with others, such as the mutual affinities of the members of the same group, their geographical distribution in past and present times, and their geological succession. it is incredible that all these facts should speak falsely. he who is not content to look, like a savage, at the phenomena of nature as disconnected, cannot any longer believe that man is the work of a separate act of creation. he will be forced to admit that the close resemblance of the embryo of man to that, for instance, of a dog--the construction of his skull, limbs and whole frame on the same plan with that of other mammals, independently of the uses to which the parts may be put--the occasional re-appearance of various structures, for instance of several muscles, which man does not normally possess, but which are common to the quadrumana--and a crowd of analogous facts--all point in the plainest manner to the conclusion that man is the co-descendant with other mammals of a common progenitor. we have seen that man incessantly presents individual differences in all parts of his body and in his mental faculties. these differences or variations seem to be induced by the same general causes, and to obey the same laws as with the lower animals. in both cases similar laws of inheritance prevail. man tends to increase at a greater rate than his means of subsistence; consequently he is occasionally subjected to a severe struggle for existence, and natural selection will have effected whatever lies within its scope. a succession of strongly-marked variations of a similar nature is by no means requisite; slight fluctuating differences in the individual suffice for the work of natural selection; not that we have any reason to suppose that in the same species, all parts of the organisation tend to vary to the same degree. we may feel assured that the inherited effects of the long-continued use or disuse of parts will have done much in the same direction with natural selection. modifications formerly of importance, though no longer of any special use, are long- inherited. when one part is modified, other parts change through the principle of correlation, of which we have instances in many curious cases of correlated monstrosities. something may be attributed to the direct and definite action of the surrounding conditions of life, such as abundant food, heat or moisture; and lastly, many characters of slight physiological importance, some indeed of considerable importance, have been gained through sexual selection. no doubt man, as well as every other animal, presents structures, which seem to our limited knowledge, not to be now of any service to him, nor to have been so formerly, either for the general conditions of life, or in the relations of one sex to the other. such structures cannot be accounted for by any form of selection, or by the inherited effects of the use and disuse of parts. we know, however, that many strange and strongly-marked peculiarities of structure occasionally appear in our domesticated productions, and if their unknown causes were to act more uniformly, they would probably become common to all the individuals of the species. we may hope hereafter to understand something about the causes of such occasional modifications, especially through the study of monstrosities: hence the labours of experimentalists, such as those of m. camille dareste, are full of promise for the future. in general we can only say that the cause of each slight variation and of each monstrosity lies much more in the constitution of the organism, than in the nature of the surrounding conditions; though new and changed conditions certainly play an important part in exciting organic changes of many kinds. through the means just specified, aided perhaps by others as yet undiscovered, man has been raised to his present state. but since he attained to the rank of manhood, he has diverged into distinct races, or as they may be more fitly called, sub-species. some of these, such as the negro and european, are so distinct that, if specimens had been brought to a naturalist without any further information, they would undoubtedly have been considered by him as good and true species. nevertheless all the races agree in so many unimportant details of structure and in so many mental peculiarities that these can be accounted for only by inheritance from a common progenitor; and a progenitor thus characterised would probably deserve to rank as man. it must not be supposed that the divergence of each race from the other races, and of all from a common stock, can be traced back to any one pair of progenitors. on the contrary, at every stage in the process of modification, all the individuals which were in any way better fitted for their conditions of life, though in different degrees, would have survived in greater numbers than the less well-fitted. the process would have been like that followed by man, when he does not intentionally select particular individuals, but breeds from all the superior individuals, and neglects the inferior. he thus slowly but surely modifies his stock, and unconsciously forms a new strain. so with respect to modifications acquired independently of selection, and due to variations arising from the nature of the organism and the action of the surrounding conditions, or from changed habits of life, no single pair will have been modified much more than the other pairs inhabiting the same country, for all will have been continually blended through free intercrossing. by considering the embryological structure of man,--the homologies which he presents with the lower animals,--the rudiments which he retains,--and the reversions to which he is liable, we can partly recall in imagination the former condition of our early progenitors; and can approximately place them in their proper place in the zoological series. we thus learn that man is descended from a hairy, tailed quadruped, probably arboreal in its habits, and an inhabitant of the old world. this creature, if its whole structure had been examined by a naturalist, would have been classed amongst the quadrumana, as surely as the still more ancient progenitor of the old and new world monkeys. the quadrumana and all the higher mammals are probably derived from an ancient marsupial animal, and this through a long line of diversified forms, from some amphibian-like creature, and this again from some fish-like animal. in the dim obscurity of the past we can see that the early progenitor of all the vertebrata must have been an aquatic animal, provided with branchiae, with the two sexes united in the same individual, and with the most important organs of the body (such as the brain and heart) imperfectly or not at all developed. this animal seems to have been more like the larvae of the existing marine ascidians than any other known form. the high standard of our intellectual powers and moral disposition is the greatest difficulty which presents itself, after we have been driven to this conclusion on the origin of man. but every one who admits the principle of evolution, must see that the mental powers of the higher animals, which are the same in kind with those of man, though so different in degree, are capable of advancement. thus the interval between the mental powers of one of the higher apes and of a fish, or between those of an ant and scale-insect, is immense; yet their development does not offer any special difficulty; for with our domesticated animals, the mental faculties are certainly variable, and the variations are inherited. no one doubts that they are of the utmost importance to animals in a state of nature. therefore the conditions are favourable for their development through natural selection. the same conclusion may be extended to man; the intellect must have been all-important to him, even at a very remote period, as enabling him to invent and use language, to make weapons, tools, traps, etc., whereby with the aid of his social habits, he long ago became the most dominant of all living creatures. a great stride in the development of the intellect will have followed, as soon as the half-art and half-instinct of language came into use; for the continued use of language will have reacted on the brain and produced an inherited effect; and this again will have reacted on the improvement of language. as mr. chauncey wright (1. 'on the limits of natural selection,' in the 'north american review,' oct. 1870, p. 295.) has well remarked, the largeness of the brain in man relatively to his body, compared with the lower animals, may be attributed in chief part to the early use of some simple form of language,--that wonderful engine which affixes signs to all sorts of objects and qualities, and excites trains of thought which would never arise from the mere impression of the senses, or if they did arise could not be followed out. the higher intellectual powers of man, such as those of ratiocination, abstraction, self- consciousness, etc., probably follow from the continued improvement and exercise of the other mental faculties. the development of the moral qualities is a more interesting problem. the foundation lies in the social instincts, including under this term the family ties. these instincts are highly complex, and in the case of the lower animals give special tendencies towards certain definite actions; but the more important elements are love, and the distinct emotion of sympathy. animals endowed with the social instincts take pleasure in one another's company, warn one another of danger, defend and aid one another in many ways. these instincts do not extend to all the individuals of the species, but only to those of the same community. as they are highly beneficial to the species, they have in all probability been acquired through natural selection. a moral being is one who is capable of reflecting on his past actions and their motives--of approving of some and disapproving of others; and the fact that man is the one being who certainly deserves this designation, is the greatest of all distinctions between him and the lower animals. but in the fourth chapter i have endeavoured to shew that the moral sense follows, firstly, from the enduring and ever-present nature of the social instincts; secondly, from man's appreciation of the approbation and disapprobation of his fellows; and thirdly, from the high activity of his mental faculties, with past impressions extremely vivid; and in these latter respects he differs from the lower animals. owing to this condition of mind, man cannot avoid looking both backwards and forwards, and comparing past impressions. hence after some temporary desire or passion has mastered his social instincts, he reflects and compares the now weakened impression of such past impulses with the ever-present social instincts; and he then feels that sense of dissatisfaction which all unsatisfied instincts leave behind them, he therefore resolves to act differently for the future,--and this is conscience. any instinct, permanently stronger or more enduring than another, gives rise to a feeling which we express by saying that it ought to be obeyed. a pointer dog, if able to reflect on his past conduct, would say to himself, i ought (as indeed we say of him) to have pointed at that hare and not have yielded to the passing temptation of hunting it. social animals are impelled partly by a wish to aid the members of their community in a general manner, but more commonly to perform certain definite actions. man is impelled by the same general wish to aid his fellows; but has few or no special instincts. he differs also from the lower animals in the power of expressing his desires by words, which thus become a guide to the aid required and bestowed. the motive to give aid is likewise much modified in man: it no longer consists solely of a blind instinctive impulse, but is much influenced by the praise or blame of his fellows. the appreciation and the bestowal of praise and blame both rest on sympathy; and this emotion, as we have seen, is one of the most important elements of the social instincts. sympathy, though gained as an instinct, is also much strengthened by exercise or habit. as all men desire their own happiness, praise or blame is bestowed on actions and motives, according as they lead to this end; and as happiness is an essential part of the general good, the greatest-happinesss principle indirectly serves as a nearly safe standard of right and wrong. as the reasoning powers advance and experience is gained, the remoter effects of certain lines of conduct on the character of the individual, and on the general good, are perceived; and then the self-regarding virtues come within the scope of public opinion, and receive praise, and their opposites blame. but with the less civilised nations reason often errs, and many bad customs and base superstitions come within the same scope, and are then esteemed as high virtues, and their breach as heavy crimes. the moral faculties are generally and justly esteemed as of higher value than the intellectual powers. but we should bear in mind that the activity of the mind in vividly recalling past impressions is one of the fundamental though secondary bases of conscience. this affords the strongest argument for educating and stimulating in all possible ways the intellectual faculties of every human being. no doubt a man with a torpid mind, if his social affections and sympathies are well developed, will be led to good actions, and may have a fairly sensitive conscience. but whatever renders the imagination more vivid and strengthens the habit of recalling and comparing past impressions, will make the conscience more sensitive, and may even somewhat compensate for weak social affections and sympathies. the moral nature of man has reached its present standard, partly through the advancement of his reasoning powers and consequently of a just public opinion, but especially from his sympathies having been rendered more tender and widely diffused through the effects of habit, example, instruction, and reflection. it is not improbable that after long practice virtuous tendencies may be inherited. with the more civilised races, the conviction of the existence of an all-seeing deity has had a potent influence on the advance of morality. ultimately man does not accept the praise or blame of his fellows as his sole guide, though few escape this influence, but his habitual convictions, controlled by reason, afford him the safest rule. his conscience then becomes the supreme judge and monitor. nevertheless the first foundation or origin of the moral sense lies in the social instincts, including sympathy; and these instincts no doubt were primarily gained, as in the case of the lower animals, through natural selection. the belief in god has often been advanced as not only the greatest, but the most complete of all the distinctions between man and the lower animals. it is however impossible, as we have seen, to maintain that this belief is innate or instinctive in man. on the other hand a belief in all-pervading spiritual agencies seems to be universal; and apparently follows from a considerable advance in man's reason, and from a still greater advance in his faculties of imagination, curiosity and wonder. i am aware that the assumed instinctive belief in god has been used by many persons as an argument for his existence. but this is a rash argument, as we should thus be compelled to believe in the existence of many cruel and malignant spirits, only a little more powerful than man; for the belief in them is far more general than in a beneficent deity. the idea of a universal and beneficent creator does not seem to arise in the mind of man, until he has been elevated by long-continued culture. he who believes in the advancement of man from some low organised form, will naturally ask how does this bear on the belief in the immortality of the soul. the barbarous races of man, as sir j. lubbock has shewn, possess no clear belief of this kind; but arguments derived from the primeval beliefs of savages are, as we have just seen, of little or no avail. few persons feel any anxiety from the impossibility of determining at what precise period in the development of the individual, from the first trace of a minute germinal vesicle, man becomes an immortal being; and there is no greater cause for anxiety because the period cannot possibly be determined in the gradually ascending organic scale. (2. the rev. j.a. picton gives a discussion to this effect in his 'new theories and the old faith,' 1870.) i am aware that the conclusions arrived at in this work will be denounced by some as highly irreligious; but he who denounces them is bound to shew why it is more irreligious to explain the origin of man as a distinct species by descent from some lower form, through the laws of variation and natural selection, than to explain the birth of the individual through the laws of ordinary reproduction. the birth both of the species and of the individual are equally parts of that grand sequence of events, which our minds refuse to accept as the result of blind chance. the understanding revolts at such a conclusion, whether or not we are able to believe that every slight variation of structure,--the union of each pair in marriage, the dissemination of each seed,--and other such events, have all been ordained for some special purpose. sexual selection has been treated at great length in this work; for, as i have attempted to shew, it has played an important part in the history of the organic world. i am aware that much remains doubtful, but i have endeavoured to give a fair view of the whole case. in the lower divisions of the animal kingdom, sexual selection seems to have done nothing: such animals are often affixed for life to the same spot, or have the sexes combined in the same individual, or what is still more important, their perceptive and intellectual faculties are not sufficiently advanced to allow of the feelings of love and jealousy, or of the exertion of choice. when, however, we come to the arthropoda and vertebrata, even to the lowest classes in these two great sub-kingdoms, sexual selection has effected much. in the several great classes of the animal kingdom,--in mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, insects, and even crustaceans,--the differences between the sexes follow nearly the same rules. the males are almost always the wooers; and they alone are armed with special weapons for fighting with their rivals. they are generally stronger and larger than the females, and are endowed with the requisite qualities of courage and pugnacity. they are provided, either exclusively or in a much higher degree than the females, with organs for vocal or instrumental music, and with odoriferous glands. they are ornamented with infinitely diversified appendages, and with the most brilliant or conspicuous colours, often arranged in elegant patterns, whilst the females are unadorned. when the sexes differ in more important structures, it is the male which is provided with special sense- organs for discovering the female, with locomotive organs for reaching her, and often with prehensile organs for holding her. these various structures for charming or securing the female are often developed in the male during only part of the year, namely the breeding-season. they have in many cases been more or less transferred to the females; and in the latter case they often appear in her as mere rudiments. they are lost or never gained by the males after emasculation. generally they are not developed in the male during early youth, but appear a short time before the age for reproduction. hence in most cases the young of both sexes resemble each other; and the female somewhat resembles her young offspring throughout life. in almost every great class a few anomalous cases occur, where there has been an almost complete transposition of the characters proper to the two sexes; the females assuming characters which properly belong to the males. this surprising uniformity in the laws regulating the differences between the sexes in so many and such widely separated classes, is intelligible if we admit the action of one common cause, namely sexual selection. sexual selection depends on the success of certain individuals over others of the same sex, in relation to the propagation of the species; whilst natural selection depends on the success of both sexes, at all ages, in relation to the general conditions of life. the sexual struggle is of two kinds; in the one it is between individuals of the same sex, generally the males, in order to drive away or kill their rivals, the females remaining passive; whilst in the other, the struggle is likewise between the individuals of the same sex, in order to excite or charm those of the opposite sex, generally the females, which no longer remain passive, but select the more agreeable partners. this latter kind of selection is closely analogous to that which man unintentionally, yet effectually, brings to bear on his domesticated productions, when he preserves during a long period the most pleasing or useful individuals, without any wish to modify the breed. the laws of inheritance determine whether characters gained through sexual selection by either sex shall be transmitted to the same sex, or to both; as well as the age at which they shall be developed. it appears that variations arising late in life are commonly transmitted to one and the same sex. variability is the necessary basis for the action of selection, and is wholly independent of it. it follows from this, that variations of the same general nature have often been taken advantage of and accumulated through sexual selection in relation to the propagation of the species, as well as through natural selection in relation to the general purposes of life. hence secondary sexual characters, when equally transmitted to both sexes can be distinguished from ordinary specific characters only by the light of analogy. the modifications acquired through sexual selection are often so strongly pronounced that the two sexes have frequently been ranked as distinct species, or even as distinct genera. such strongly-marked differences must be in some manner highly important; and we know that they have been acquired in some instances at the cost not only of inconvenience, but of exposure to actual danger. the belief in the power of sexual selection rests chiefly on the following considerations. certain characters are confined to one sex; and this alone renders it probable that in most cases they are connected with the act of reproduction. in innumerable instances these characters are fully developed only at maturity, and often during only a part of the year, which is always the breeding-season. the males (passing over a few exceptional cases) are the more active in courtship; they are the better armed, and are rendered the more attractive in various ways. it is to be especially observed that the males display their attractions with elaborate care in the presence of the females; and that they rarely or never display them excepting during the season of love. it is incredible that all this should be purposeless. lastly we have distinct evidence with some quadrupeds and birds, that the individuals of one sex are capable of feeling a strong antipathy or preference for certain individuals of the other sex. bearing in mind these facts, and the marked results of man's unconscious selection, when applied to domesticated animals and cultivated plants, it seems to me almost certain that if the individuals of one sex were during a long series of generations to prefer pairing with certain individuals of the other sex, characterised in some peculiar manner, the offspring would slowly but surely become modified in this same manner. i have not attempted to conceal that, excepting when the males are more numerous than the females, or when polygamy prevails, it is doubtful how the more attractive males succeed in leaving a large number of offspring to inherit their superiority in ornaments or other charms than the less attractive males; but i have shewn that this would probably follow from the females,-- especially the more vigorous ones, which would be the first to breed,-- preferring not only the more attractive but at the same time the more vigorous and victorious males. although we have some positive evidence that birds appreciate bright and beautiful objects, as with the bower-birds of australia, and although they certainly appreciate the power of song, yet i fully admit that it is astonishing that the females of many birds and some mammals should be endowed with sufficient taste to appreciate ornaments, which we have reason to attribute to sexual selection; and this is even more astonishing in the case of reptiles, fish, and insects. but we really know little about the minds of the lower animals. it cannot be supposed, for instance, that male birds of paradise or peacocks should take such pains in erecting, spreading, and vibrating their beautiful plumes before the females for no purpose. we should remember the fact given on excellent authority in a former chapter, that several peahens, when debarred from an admired male, remained widows during a whole season rather than pair with another bird. nevertheless i know of no fact in natural history more wonderful than that the female argus pheasant should appreciate the exquisite shading of the ball-and-socket ornaments and the elegant patterns on the wing-feather of the male. he who thinks that the male was created as he now exists must admit that the great plumes, which prevent the wings from being used for flight, and which are displayed during courtship and at no other time in a manner quite peculiar to this one species, were given to him as an ornament. if so, he must likewise admit that the female was created and endowed with the capacity of appreciating such ornaments. i differ only in the conviction that the male argus pheasant acquired his beauty gradually, through the preference of the females during many generations for the more highly ornamented males; the aesthetic capacity of the females having been advanced through exercise or habit, just as our own taste is gradually improved. in the male through the fortunate chance of a few feathers being left unchanged, we can distinctly trace how simple spots with a little fulvous shading on one side may have been developed by small steps into the wonderful ball-and-socket ornaments; and it is probable that they were actually thus developed. everyone who admits the principle of evolution, and yet feels great difficulty in admitting that female mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish, could have acquired the high taste implied by the beauty of the males, and which generally coincides with our own standard, should reflect that the nerve-cells of the brain in the highest as well as in the lowest members of the vertebrate series, are derived from those of the common progenitor of this great kingdom. for we can thus see how it has come to pass that certain mental faculties, in various and widely distinct groups of animals, have been developed in nearly the same manner and to nearly the same degree. the reader who has taken the trouble to go through the several chapters devoted to sexual selection, will be able to judge how far the conclusions at which i have arrived are supported by sufficient evidence. if he accepts these conclusions he may, i think, safely extend them to mankind; but it would be superfluous here to repeat what i have so lately said on the manner in which sexual selection apparently has acted on man, both on the male and female side, causing the two sexes to differ in body and mind, and the several races to differ from each other in various characters, as well as from their ancient and lowly-organised progenitors. he who admits the principle of sexual selection will be led to the remarkable conclusion that the nervous system not only regulates most of the existing functions of the body, but has indirectly influenced the progressive development of various bodily structures and of certain mental qualities. courage, pugnacity, perseverance, strength and size of body, weapons of all kinds, musical organs, both vocal and instrumental, bright colours and ornamental appendages, have all been indirectly gained by the one sex or the other, through the exertion of choice, the influence of love and jealousy, and the appreciation of the beautiful in sound, colour or form; and these powers of the mind manifestly depend on the development of the brain. man scans with scrupulous care the character and pedigree of his horses, cattle, and dogs before he matches them; but when he comes to his own marriage he rarely, or never, takes any such care. he is impelled by nearly the same motives as the lower animals, when they are left to their own free choice, though he is in so far superior to them that he highly values mental charms and virtues. on the other hand he is strongly attracted by mere wealth or rank. yet he might by selection do something not only for the bodily constitution and frame of his offspring, but for their intellectual and moral qualities. both sexes ought to refrain from marriage if they are in any marked degree inferior in body or mind; but such hopes are utopian and will never be even partially realised until the laws of inheritance are thoroughly known. everyone does good service, who aids towards this end. when the principles of breeding and inheritance are better understood, we shall not hear ignorant members of our legislature rejecting with scorn a plan for ascertaining whether or not consanguineous marriages are injurious to man. the advancement of the welfare of mankind is a most intricate problem: all ought to refrain from marriage who cannot avoid abject poverty for their children; for poverty is not only a great evil, but tends to its own increase by leading to recklessness in marriage. on the other hand, as mr. galton has remarked, if the prudent avoid marriage, whilst the reckless marry, the inferior members tend to supplant the better members of society. man, like every other animal, has no doubt advanced to his present high condition through a struggle for existence consequent on his rapid multiplication; and if he is to advance still higher, it is to be feared that he must remain subject to a severe struggle. otherwise he would sink into indolence, and the more gifted men would not be more successful in the battle of life than the less gifted. hence our natural rate of increase, though leading to many and obvious evils, must not be greatly diminished by any means. there should be open competition for all men; and the most able should not be prevented by laws or customs from succeeding best and rearing the largest number of offspring. important as the struggle for existence has been and even still is, yet as far as the highest part of man's nature is concerned there are other agencies more important. for the moral qualities are advanced, either directly or indirectly, much more through the effects of habit, the reasoning powers, instruction, religion, etc., than through natural selection; though to this latter agency may be safely attributed the social instincts, which afforded the basis for the development of the moral sense. the main conclusion arrived at in this work, namely, that man is descended from some lowly organised form, will, i regret to think, be highly distasteful to many. but there can hardly be a doubt that we are descended from barbarians. the astonishment which i felt on first seeing a party of fuegians on a wild and broken shore will never be forgotten by me, for the reflection at once rushed into my mind--such were our ancestors. these men were absolutely naked and bedaubed with paint, their long hair was tangled, their mouths frothed with excitement, and their expression was wild, startled, and distrustful. they possessed hardly any arts, and like wild animals lived on what they could catch; they had no government, and were merciless to every one not of their own small tribe. he who has seen a savage in his native land will not feel much shame, if forced to acknowledge that the blood of some more humble creature flows in his veins. for my own part i would as soon be descended from that heroic little monkey, who braved his dreaded enemy in order to save the life of his keeper, or from that old baboon, who descending from the mountains, carried away in triumph his young comrade from a crowd of astonished dogs--as from a savage who delights to torture his enemies, offers up bloody sacrifices, practices infanticide without remorse, treats his wives like slaves, knows no decency, and is haunted by the grossest superstitions. man may be excused for feeling some pride at having risen, though not through his own exertions, to the very summit of the organic scale; and the fact of his having thus risen, instead of having been aboriginally placed there, may give him hope for a still higher destiny in the distant future. but we are not here concerned with hopes or fears, only with the truth as far as our reason permits us to discover it; and i have given the evidence to the best of my ability. we must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system--with all these exalted powers--man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin. supplemental note. on sexual selection in relation to monkeys. reprinted from nature, november 2, 1876, p. 18. in the discussion on sexual selection in my 'descent of man,' no case interested and perplexed me so much as the brightly-coloured hinder ends and adjoining parts of certain monkeys. as these parts are more brightly coloured in one sex than the other, and as they become more brilliant during the season of love, i concluded that the colours had been gained as a sexual attraction. i was well aware that i thus laid myself open to ridicule; though in fact it is not more surprising that a monkey should display his bright-red hinder end than that a peacock should display his magnificent tail. i had, however, at that time no evidence of monkeys exhibiting this part of their bodies during their courtship; and such display in the case of birds affords the best evidence that the ornaments of the males are of service to them by attracting or exciting the females. i have lately read an article by joh. von fischer, of gotha, published in 'der zoologische garten,' april 1876, on the expression of monkeys under various emotions, which is well worthy of study by any one interested in the subject, and which shews that the author is a careful and acute observer. in this article there is an account of the behaviour of a young male mandrill when he first beheld himself in a looking-glass, and it is added, that after a time he turned round and presented his red hinder end to the glass. accordingly i wrote to herr j. von fischer to ask what he supposed was the meaning of this strange action, and he has sent me two long letters full of new and curious details, which will, i hope, be hereafter published. he says that he was himself at first perplexed by the above action, and was thus led carefully to observe several individuals of various other species of monkeys, which he has long kept in his house. he finds that not only the mandrill (cynocephalus mormon) but the drill (c. leucophaeus) and three other kinds of baboons (c. hamadryas, sphinx, and babouin), also cynopithecus niger, and macacus rhesus and nemestrinus, turn this part of their bodies, which in all these species is more or less brightly coloured, to him when they are pleased, and to other persons as a sort of greeting. he took pains to cure a macacus rhesus, which he had kept for five years, of this indecorous habit, and at last succeeded. these monkeys are particularly apt to act in this manner, grinning at the same time, when first introduced to a new monkey, but often also to their old monkey friends; and after this mutual display they begin to play together. the young mandrill ceased spontaneously after a time to act in this manner towards his master, von fischer, but continued to do so towards persons who were strangers and to new monkeys. a young cynopithecus niger never acted, excepting on one occasion, in this way towards his master, but frequently towards strangers, and continues to do so up to the present time. from these facts von fischer concludes that the monkeys which behaved in this manner before a looking-glass (viz., the mandrill, drill, cynopithecus niger, macacus rhesus and nemestrinus) acted as if their reflection were a new acquaintance. the mandrill and drill, which have their hinder ends especially ornamented, display it even whilst quite young, more frequently and more ostentatiously than do the other kinds. next in order comes cynocephalus hamadryas, whilst the other species act in this manner seldomer. the individuals, however, of the same species vary in this respect, and some which were very shy never displayed their hinder ends. it deserves especial attention that von fischer has never seen any species purposely exhibit the hinder part of its body, if not at all coloured. this remark applies to many individuals of macacus cynomolgus and cercocebus radiatus (which is closely allied to m. rhesus), to three species of cercopithecus and several american monkeys. the habit of turning the hinder ends as a greeting to an old friend or new acquaintance, which seems to us so odd, is not really more so than the habits of many savages, for instance that of rubbing their bellies with their hands, or rubbing noses together. the habit with the mandrill and drill seems to be instinctive or inherited, as it was followed by very young animals; but it is modified or guided, like so many other instincts, by observation, for von fischer says that they take pains to make their display fully; and if made before two observers, they turn to him who seems to pay the most attention. with respect to the origin of the habit, von fischer remarks that his monkeys like to have their naked hinder ends patted or stroked, and that they then grunt with pleasure. they often also turn this part of their bodies to other monkeys to have bits of dirt picked off, and so no doubt it would be with respect to thorns. but the habit with adult animals is connected to a certain extent with sexual feelings, for von fischer watched through a glass door a female cynopithecus niger, and she during several days, "umdrehte und dem männchen mit gurgelnden tönen die stark geröthete sitzflache zeigte, was ich früher nie an diesem thier bemerkt hatte. beim anblick dieses gegenstandes erregte sich das männchen sichtlich, denn es polterte heftig an den stäben, ebenfalls gurgelnde laute ausstossend." as all the monkeys which have the hinder parts of their bodies more or less brightly coloured live, according to von fischer, in open rocky places, he thinks that these colours serve to render one sex conspicuous at a distance to the other; but, as monkeys are such gregarious animals, i should have thought that there was no need for the sexes to recognise each other at a distance. it seems to me more probable that the bright colours, whether on the face or hinder end, or, as in the mandrill, on both, serve as a sexual ornament and attraction. anyhow, as we now know that monkeys have the habit of turning their hinder ends towards other monkeys, it ceases to be at all surprising that it should have been this part of their bodies which has been more or less decorated. the fact that it is only the monkeys thus characterised which, as far as at present known, act in this manner as a greeting towards other monkeys renders it doubtful whether the habit was first acquired from some independent cause, and that afterwards the parts in question were coloured as a sexual ornament; or whether the colouring and the habit of turning round were first acquired through variation and sexual selection, and that afterwards the habit was retained as a sign of pleasure or as a greeting, through the principle of inherited association. this principle apparently comes into play on many occasions: thus it is generally admitted that the songs of birds serve mainly as an attraction during the season of love, and that the leks, or great congregations of the black-grouse, are connected with their courtship; but the habit of singing has been retained by some birds when they feel happy, for instance by the common robin, and the habit of congregating has been retained by the black- grouse during other seasons of the year. i beg leave to refer to one other point in relation to sexual selection. it has been objected that this form of selection, as far as the ornaments of the males are concerned, implies that all females within the same district must possess and exercise exactly the same taste. it should, however, be observed, in the first place, that although the range of variation of a species may be very large, it is by no means indefinite. i have elsewhere given a good instance of this fact in the pigeon, of which there are at least a hundred varieties differing widely in their colours, and at least a score of varieties of the fowl differing in the same kind of way; but the range of colour in these two species is extremely distinct. therefore the females of natural species cannot have an unlimited scope for their taste. in the second place, i presume that no supporter of the principle of sexual selection believes that the females select particular points of beauty in the males; they are merely excited or attracted in a greater degree by one male than by another, and this seems often to depend, especially with birds, on brilliant colouring. even man, excepting perhaps an artist, does not analyse the slight differences in the features of the woman whom he may admire, on which her beauty depends. the male mandrill has not only the hinder end of his body, but his face gorgeously coloured and marked with oblique ridges, a yellow beard, and other ornaments. we may infer from what we see of the variation of animals under domestication, that the above several ornaments of the mandrill were gradually acquired by one individual varying a little in one way, and another individual in another way. the males which were the handsomest or the most attractive in any manner to the females would pair oftenest, and would leave rather more offspring than other males. the offspring of the former, although variously intercrossed, would either inherit the peculiarities of their fathers or transmit an increased tendency to vary in the same manner. consequently the whole body of males inhabiting the same country would tend from the effects of constant intercrossing to become modified almost uniformly, but sometimes a little more in one character and sometimes in another, though at an extremely slow rate; all ultimately being thus rendered more attractive to the females. the process is like that which i have called unconscious selection by man, and of which i have given several instances. in one country the inhabitants value a fleet or light dog or horse, and in another country a heavier and more powerful one; in neither country is there any selection of individual animals with lighter or stronger bodies and limbs; nevertheless after a considerable lapse of time the individuals are found to have been modified in the desired manner almost uniformly, though differently in each country. in two absolutely distinct countries inhabited by the same species, the individuals of which can never during long ages have intermigrated and intercrossed, and where, moreover, the variations will probably not have been identically the same, sexual selection might cause the males to differ. nor does the belief appear to me altogether fanciful that two sets of females, surrounded by a very different environment, would be apt to acquire somewhat different tastes with respect to form, sound, or colour. however this may be, i have given in my 'descent of man' instances of closely-allied birds inhabiting distinct countries, of which the young and the females cannot be distinguished, whilst the adult males differ considerably, and this may be attributed with much probability to the action of sexual selection. index. abbot, c., on the battles of seals. abductor of the fifth metatarsal, presence of, in man. abercrombie, dr., on disease of the brain affecting speech. abipones, marriage customs of the. abortion, prevalence of the practice of. abou-simbel, caves of. abramis brama. abstraction, power of, in animals. acalles, stridulation of. acanthodactylus capensis, sexual differences of colour in. accentor modularis. acclimatisation, difference of, in different races of men. achetidae, stridulation of the;
