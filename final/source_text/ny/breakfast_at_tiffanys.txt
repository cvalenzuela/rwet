Breakfast at Tiffany's  
Truman Capote, 1958 
 
I  am  always  drawn  back  to  places  where  I  have  lived,  the  houses  and  their 
neighborhoods.  For  instance,  there  is  a  brownstone  in  the  East  Seventies  where, 
during the early years of the war, I had my first New York apartment. It was one room 
crowded with attic furniture, a sofa and fat chairs upholstered in that itchy, particular red 
velvet that one associates with hot days on a tram. The walls were stucco, and a color 
rather like tobacco-spit. Everywhere, in the bathroom too, there were prints of Roman 
ruins freckled brown with age. The single window looked out on a fire escape. Even so, 
my spirits heightened whenever I felt in my pocket the key to this apartment; with all its 
gloom, it still was a place of my own, the first, and my books were there, and jars of 
pencils to sharpen, everything I needed, so I felt, to become the writer I wanted to be. 

It never occurred to me in those days to write about Holly Golightly, and probably it 
would not now except for a conversation I had with Joe Bell that set the whole memory 
of her in motion again. 

Holly  Golightly  had  been  a  tenant  in  the  old  brownstone;  she'd  occupied  the 
apartment  below  mine.  As  for  Joe  Bell,  he  ran  a  bar around  the corner  on Lexington 
Avenue; he still does. Both Holly and I used to go there six, seven times a day, not for a 
drink, not always, but to make telephone calls: during the war a private telephone was 
hard to come by. Moreover, Joe Bell was good about taking messages, which in Holly's 
case was no small favor, for she had a tremendous many. 

Of  course  this  was  a  long  time  ago,  and  until  last  week  I  hadn't  seen  Joe  Bell  in 
several years. Off and on we'd kept in touch, and occasionally I'd stopped by his bar 
when  passing  through  the  neighborhood;  but  actually  we'd never  been  strong  friends 
except in as much as we were both friends of Holly Golightly. Joe Bell hasn't an easy 
nature,  he  admits  it  himself,  he  says  it's  because  he's  a  bachelor  and  has  a  sour 
stomach. Anyone who knows him will tell you he's a hard man to talk to. Impossible if 
you  don't  share  his  fixations,  of  which  Holly  is  one.  Some  others  are:  ice  hockey, 
Weimaraner dogs, Our Gal Sunday (a soap serial he has listened to for fifteen years), 
and Gilbert and Sullivan -- he claims to be related to one or the other, I can't remember 
which. 

And so when, late last Tuesday afternoon, the telephone rang and I heard "Joe Bell 
here," I knew it must be about Holly. He didn't say so, just: "Can you rattle right over 
here? It's important," and there was a croak of excitement in his froggy voice. 

I took a taxi in a downpour of October rain, and on my way I even thought she might 

be there, that I would see Holly again. 

But  there  was  no  one on  the premises  except  the  proprietor.  Joe  Bell's is  a  quiet 
place compared to most Lexington Avenue bars. It boasts neither neon nor television. 
Two  old  mirrors  reflect  the  weather  from  the  streets;  and  behind  the  bar,  in  a  niche 

surrounded by photographs of ice-hockey stars, there is always a large bowl of fresh 
flowers that Joe Bell himself arranges with matronly care. That is what he was doing 
when I came in. 

"Naturally," he said, rooting a gladiola deep into the bowl, "naturally I wouldn't have 
got you over here if it wasn't I wanted your opinion. It's peculiar. A very peculiar thing 
has happened." 

"You heard from Holly?" 
He fingered a leaf, as though uncertain of how to answer. A small man with a fine 
head  of  coarse  white  hair,  he  has  a  bony,  sloping  face  better  suited  to  someone  far 
taller; his complexion seems permanently sunburned: now it grew even redder. "I can't 
say exactly heard from her. I mean, I don't know. That's why I want your opinion. Let 
me build you a drink. Something new. They call it a White Angel," he said, mixing one-
half vodka, one-half gin, no vermouth. While I drank the result, Joe Bell stood sucking 
on  a  Tums  and  turning  over  in  his  mind  what  he  had  to  tell  me.  Then:  "You  recall  a 
certain Mr. I.Y. Yunioshi? A gentleman from Japan." 

"From  California,"  I  said,  recalling  Mr.  Yunioshi  perfectly.  He's  a  photographer  on 
one of the picture magazines, and when I knew him he lived in the studio apartment on 
the top floor of the brownstone. 

"Don't go mixing me up. All I'm asking, you know who I mean? Okay. So last night 
who comes waltzing in here but this selfsame Mr. I. Y. Yunioshi. I haven't seen him, I 
guess it's over two years. And where do you think he's been those two years?" 

"Africa." 
Joe  Bell  stopped  crunching  on  his  Tums,  his  eyes  narrowed.  "So  how  did  you 

know?" 

"Read it in Winchell." Which I had, as a matter of fact. 
He  rang  open  his  cash  register,  and  produced  a  manila  envelope.  "Well,  see  did 

you read this in Winchell." 

In the envelope were three photographs, more or less the same, though taken from 
different angles: a tall delicate Negro man wearing a calico skirt and with a shy, yet vain 
smile, displaying in his hands an odd wood sculpture, an elongated carving of a head, a 
girl's, her hair sleek and short as a young man's, her smooth wood eyes too large and 
tilted  in  the  tapering  face,  her  mouth  wide,  overdrawn,  not  unlike  clown-lips.  On  a 
glance  it  resembled  most  primitive  carving;  and  then  it  didn't,  for  here  was  the  spit-
image of Holly Golightly, at least as much of a likeness as a dark still thing could be. 

"Now what do you make of that?" said Joe Bell, satisfied with my puzzlement. 
"It looks like her." 
"Listen, boy," and he slapped his hand on the bar, "it is her. Sure as I'm a man fit to 

wear britches. The little Jap knew it was her the minute he saw her." 

"He saw her? In Africa?" 
"Well.  Just  the  statue  there.  But  it  comes  to  the  same  thing.  Read  the  facts  for 

 

2 

yourself,"  he  said,  turning  over  one  of  the  photographs.  On  the  reverse  was  written: 
Wood Carving, S Tribe, Tococul, East Anglia, Christmas Day, 1956. 

He said, "Here's what the Jap says," and the story was this: On Christmas day Mr. 
Yunioshi  had  passed  with  his  camera  through  Tococul,  a  village  in  the  tangles  of 
nowhere  and  of  no  interest,  merely  a  congregation  of  mud  huts  with  monkeys  in  the 
yards and buzzards on the roofs. He'd decided to move on when he saw suddenly a 
Negro  squatting  in  a  doorway  carving  monkeys  on  a  walking  stick.  Mr.  Yunioshi  was 
impressed and asked to see more of his work. Whereupon he was shown the carving 
of  the  girl's  head:  and  felt,  so  he  told  Joe  Bell,  as  if  he  were  falling  in  a  dream.  But 
when he offered to buy it the Negro cupped his private parts in his hand (apparently a 
tender  gesture,  comparable  to  tapping  one's  heart)  and said  no.  A pound  of  salt  and 
ten  dollars,  a  wristwatch  and  two  pounds  of  salt  and  twenty  dollars,  nothing  swayed 
him.  Mr.  Yunioshi  was  in  all  events  determined  to  learn  how  the  carving  came  to  be 
made. It cost him his salt and his watch, and the incident was conveyed in African and 
pig-English and finger-talk. But it would seem that in the spring of that year a party of 
three white persons had appeared out of the brush riding horseback. A young woman 
and two men. The men, both red-eyed with fever, were forced for several weeks to stay 
shut and shivering in an isolated hut, while the young woman, having presently taken a 
fancy to the wood-carver, shared the woodcarver's mat. 

"I don't credit that part," Joe Bell said squeamishly. "I know she had her ways, but I 

don't think she'd be up to anything as much as that." 

"And then?" 
"Then nothing," he shrugged. "By and by she went like she come, rode away on a 

horse." 

"Alone, or with the two men?" 
Joe Bell blinked. "With the two men, I guess. Now the Jap, he asked about her up 
and down the country. But nobody else had ever seen her." Then it was as if he could 
feel  my  own  sense  of  letdown  transmitting  itself  to  him,  and  he  wanted  no  part  of  it. 
"One thing you got to admit, it's the only definite news in I don't know how many" -- he 
counted on his fingers: there weren't enough -- "years. All I hope, I hope she's rich. She 
must be rich. You got to be rich to go mucking around in Africa." 

"She's  probably  never  set  foot  in  Africa,"  I  said,  believing  it;  yet  I  could  see  her 
there, it was somewhere she would have gone. And the carved head: I looked at the 
photographs again. 

"You know so much, where is she?" 
"Dead. Or in a crazy house. Or married. I think she's married and quieted down and 

maybe right in this very city." 

He considered a moment. "No," he said, and shook his head. "I'll tell you why. If she 
was in this city I'd have seen her. You take a man that likes to walk, a man like me, a 
man's been walking in the streets going on ten or twelve years, and all those years he's 

got his eye out for one person, and nobody's ever her, don't it stand to reason she's 
not there? I see pieces of her all the time, a flat little bottom, any skinny girl that walks 
fast and straight -- " He paused, as though too aware of how intently I was looking at 
him. "You think I'm round the bend?" 

"It's just that I didn't know you'd been in love with her. Not like that." 
I was sorry I'd said it; it disconcerted him. He scooped up the photographs and put 
them  back  in  their  envelope.  I  looked  at  my  watch.  I  hadn't  any  place  to  go,  but  I 
thought it was better to leave. 

"Hold on," he said, gripping my wrist. "Sure I loved her. But it wasn't that I wanted to 
touch  her."  And  he  added,  without  smiling:  "Not  that  I  don't  think  about  that  side  of 
things. Even at my age, and I'll be sixty-seven January ten. It's a peculiar fact -- but, the 
older  I  grow,  that  side  of  things  seems  to  be  on  my  mind  more  and  more.  I  don't 
remember thinking about it so much even when I was a youngster and it's every other 
minute.  Maybe  the  older  you  grow  and  the  less  easy  it  is  to  put  thought  into  action, 
maybe that's why it gets all locked up in your head and becomes a burden. Whenever I 
read  in  the  paper  about  an  old  man  disgracing  himself,  I  know  it's  because  of  this 
burden. But" -- he poured himself a jigger of whiskey and swallowed it neat -- "I'll never 
disgrace  myself.  And  I  swear,  it  never  crossed  my  mind  about  Holly.  You  can  love 
somebody  without  it  being  like  that.  You  keep  them  a  stranger,  a  stranger  who's  a 
friend." 

Two men came into the bar, and it seemed the moment to leave. Joe Bell followed 

me to the door. He caught my wrist again. "Do you believe it?" 

"That you didn't want to touch her?" 
"I mean about Africa." 
At that moment I couldn't seem to remember the story, only the image of her riding 

away on a horse. "Anyway, she's gone." 

"Yeah," he said, opening the door. "Just gone." 
Outside, the rain had stopped, there was only a mist of it in the air, so I turned the 
corner  and  walked  along  the  street  where  the  brownstone  stands.  It  is  a  street  with 
trees that in the summer make cool patterns on the pavement; but now the leaves were 
yellowed  and  mostly  down,  and  the  rain  had  made  them  slippery,  they  skidded 
underfoot. The brownstone is midway in the block, next to a church where a blue tower-
clock  tolls  the  hours.  It  has  been  sleeked  up  since  my  day;  a  smart  black  door  has 
replaced the old frosted glass, and gray elegant shutters frame the windows. No one I 
remember still lives there except Madame Sapphia Spanella, a husky coloratura who 
every  afternoon  went  roller-skating  in  Central  Park.  I know she's  still  there  because  I 
went up the steps and looked at the mailboxes. It was one of these mailboxes that had 
first made me aware of Holly Golightly. 

 
I'd been living in the house about a week when I noticed that the mailbox belonging 

 

3 

to  Apt.  2  had  a  name-slot  fitted  with  a  curious  card.  Printed,  rather  Cartier-formal,  it 
read: Miss Holiday Golightly; and, underneath, in the corner, Traveling. It nagged me 
like a tune: Miss Holiday Golightly, Traveling. 

One night, it was long past twelve, I woke up at the sound of Mr. Yunioshi calling 
down the stairs. Since he lived on the top floor, his voice fell through the whole house, 
exasperated and stern. "Miss Golightly! I must protest!" 

The voice that came back, welling up from the bottom of the stairs, was silly-young 

and self-amused. "Oh, darling, I am sorry. I lost the goddamn key." 

"You  cannot  go  on  ringing  my  bell.  You  must  please,  please  have  yourself  a  key 

made." 

"But I lose them all." 
"I  work,  I  have  to  sleep,"  Mr.  Yunioshi  shouted.  "But  always  you  are  ringing  my 

bell…" 

"Oh, don't be angry, you dear little man: I won't do it again. And if you promise not 
to be angry" -- her voice was coming nearer, she was climbing the stairs -- "I might let 
you take those pictures we mentioned." 

By  now  I'd  left  my  bed  and  opened  the  door  an  inch.  I  could  hear  Mr.  Yunioshi's 

silence: hear, because it was accompanied by an audible change of breath. 

"When?" he said. 
The girl laughed. "Sometime," she answered, slurring the word. 
"Any time," he said, and closed his door. 
I  went  out  into  the  hall  and  leaned  over  the  banister,  just  enough  to  see  without 
being seen. She was still on the stairs, now she reached the landing, and the ragbag 
colors of her boy's hair, tawny streaks, strands of albino-blond and yellow, caught the 
hall light. It was a warm evening, nearly summer, and she wore a slim cool black dress, 
black sandals, a pearl choker. For all her chic thinness, she had an almost breakfast-
cereal air of health, a soap and lemon cleanness, a rough pink darkening in the cheeks. 
Her mouth was large, her nose upturned. A pair of dark glasses blotted out her eyes. It 
was  a  face  beyond  childhood,  yet  this  side  of  belonging  to  a  woman.  I  thought  her 
anywhere between sixteen and thirty; as it turned out, she was shy two months of her 
nineteenth birthday. 

She was not alone. There was a man following behind her. The way his plump hand 
clutched at her hip seemed somehow improper; not morally, aesthetically. He was short 
and  vast, sun-lamped  and  pomaded,  a  man  in  a  buttressed  pin-stripe  suit  with  a  red 
carnation withering in the lapel. When they reached her door she rummaged her purse 
in search of a key, and took no notice of the fact that his thick lips were nuzzling the 
nape of her neck. At last, though, finding the key and opening her door, she turned to 
him cordially: "Bless you, darling -- you were sweet to see me home." 

"Hey, baby!" he said, for the door was closing in his face. 
"Yes, Harry?" 

"Harry was the other guy. I'm Sid. Sid Arbuck. You like me." 
"I worship you, Mr. Arbuck. But good night, Mr. Arbuck." 
Mr. Arbuck stared with disbelief as the door shut firmly. "Hey, baby, let me in baby. 

You like me baby. 

"I'm a liked guy. Didn't I pick up the check, five people, your friends, I never seen 

them before? Don't that give me the right you should like me? You like me, baby." 

He  tapped  on  the  door gently,  then  louder;  finally he  took several  steps  back, his 
body hunched and lowering, as though he meant to charge it, crash it down. Instead, 
he plunged down the stairs, slamming a fist against the wall. Just as he reached the 
bottom, the door of the girl's apartment opened and she poked out her head. 

"Oh, Mr. Arbuck ... " 
He turned back, a smile of relief oiling his face: she'd only been teasing. 
"The next time a girl wants a little powder-room change," she called, not teasing at 

all, "take my advice, darling: don't give her twenty-cents!" 

 
She kept her promise to Mr. Yunioshi; or I assume she did not ring his bell again, 
for in the next days she started ringing mine, sometimes at two in the morning, three 
and four: she had no qualms at what hour she got me out of bed to push the buzzer 
that  released  the  downstairs  door.  As  I  had  few  friends,  and  none  who  would  come 
around  so  late,  I  always  knew  that  it  was  her.  But  on  the  first  occasions  of  its 
happening, I went to my door, half-expecting bad news, a telegram; and Miss Golightly 
would call up: "Sorry, darling -- I forgot my key." 

Of  course  we'd  never  met.  Though  actually,  on  the  stairs,  in  the  street,  we  often 
came face-to-face; but she seemed not quite to see me. She was never without dark 
glasses,  she  was  always  well  groomed,  there  was  a  consequential  good  taste  in  the 
plainness of her clothes, the blues and grays and lack of luster that made her, herself, 
shine  so.  One  might  have  thought  her  a  photographer's  model,  perhaps  a  young 
actress, except that it was obvious, judging from her hours, she hadn't time to be either. 
Now  and  then  I  ran  across  her  outside our  neighborhood. Once  a visiting  relative 
took me to "21," and there, at a superior table, surrounded by four men, none of them 
Mr. Arbuck, yet all of them interchangeable with him, was Miss Golightly, idly, publicly 
combing  her  hair;  and  her  expression,  an  unrealized  yawn,  put,  by  example,  a 
dampener,  on  the  excitement  I  felt  over  dining  at  so  swanky  a  place.  Another  night, 
deep in the summer, the heat of my room sent me out into the streets. I walked down 
Third Avenue to Fifty-first Street, where there was an antique store with an object in its 
window I admired: a palace of a bird cage, a mosque of minarets and bamboo rooms 
yearning  to  be  filled  with  talkative  parrots.  But  the  price  was  three  hundred  and  fifty 
dollars. On the way home I noticed a cab-driver crowd gathered in front of P. J. Clark's 
saloon, apparently attracted there by a happy group of whiskey-eyed Australian army 
officers baritoning, "Waltzing Matilda." As they sang they took turns spin-dancing a girl 

 

4 

over the cobbles under the El; and the girl, Miss Golightly, to be sure, floated round in 
their, arms light as a scarf. 

But if Miss Golightly remained unconscious of my existence, except as a doorbell 
convenience, I became, through the summer, rather an authority on hers. I discovered, 
from observing the trash-basket outside her door, that her regular reading consisted of 
tabloids  and  travel  folders  and  astrological  charts;  that  she  smoked  an  esoteric 
cigarette called Picayunes; survived on cottage cheese and melba toast; that her vari-
colored  hair  was  somewhat  self-induced.  The  same  source  made  it  evident  that  she 
received V-letters by the bale. They were always torn into strips like bookmarks. I used 
occasionally to pluck myself a bookmark in passing. Remember and miss you and rain 
and please write and damn and goddamn were the words that recurred most often on 
these slips; those, and lonesome and love. 

Also, she had a cat and she played the guitar. On days when the sun was strong, 
she would wash her hair, and together with the cat, a red tiger-striped tom, sit out on 
the fire escape thumbing a guitar while her hair dried. Whenever I heard the music, I 
would go stand quietly by my window. She played very well, and sometimes sang too. 
Sang in the hoarse, breaking tones of a boy's adolescent voice. She knew all the show 
hits, Cole Porter and Kurt Weill; especially she liked the songs from Oklahoma!, which 
were  new  that  summer  and  everywhere.  But  there  were  moments  when  she  played 
songs that made you wonder where she learned them, where indeed she came from. 
Harsh-tender wandering tunes with words that smacked of pineywoods or prairie. One 
went:  Don't  wanna  sleep,  Don't  wanna  die,  Just  wanna  go  a-travelin'  through  the 
pastures  of  the  sky;  and  this  one  seemed  to  gratify  her  the  most,  for  often  she 
continued it long after her hair had dried, after the sun had gone and there were lighted 
windows in the dusk. 

But our acquaintance did not make headway until September, an evening with the 
first  ripple-chills  of  autumn  running  through  it.  I'd  been  to  a  movie,  come  home  and 
gone  to  bed  with  a  bourbon  nightcap  and  the  newest  Simenon:  so  much  my  idea  of 
comfort that I couldn't understand a sense of unease that multiplied until I could hear 
my  heart  beating.  It  was  a  feeling  I'd  read  about,  written  about,  but  never  before 
experienced. The feeling of being watched. Of someone in the room. Then: an abrupt 
rapping  at  the  window,  a  glimpse  of  ghostly  gray:  I  spilled the  bourbon.  It  was  some 
little while before I could bring myself to open the window, and ask Miss Golightly what 
she wanted. 

"I've got the most terrifying man downstairs," she said, stepping off the fire escape 
into the room. "I mean he's sweet when he isn't drunk, but let him start lapping up the 
vino,  and  oh  God  quel  beast!  If  there's  one  thing  I  loathe,  it's  men  who  bite."  She 
loosened a gray flannel robe off her shoulder, to show me evidence of what happens if 
a man bites. The robe was all she was wearing. "I'm sorry if I frightened you. But when 
the  beast  got  so  tiresome  I  just  went  out  the  window.  I  think  he  thinks  I'm  in  the 

bathroom, not that I give a damn what he thinks, the hell with him, he'll get tired, he'll 
go to sleep, my God he should, eight martinis before dinner and enough wine to wash 
an elephant. Listen, you can throw me out if you want to. I've got a gall barging in on 
you like this. But that fire escape was damned icy. And you looked so cozy. Like my 
brother Fred. We used to sleep four in a bed, and he was the only one that ever let me 
hug  him  on  a  cold  night.  By  the  way,  do  you  mind  if  I  call  you  Fred?"  She'd  come 
completely into the room now, and she paused there, staring at me. I'd never seen her 
before  not  wearing  dark  glasses,  and  it  was  obvious  now  that  they  were  prescription 
lenses, for without them her eyes had an assessing squint, like a jeweler's. They were 
large  eyes,  a  little  blue,  a  little  green,  dotted  with  bits  of  brown:  vari-colored,  like  her 
hair; and, like her hair, they gave out a lively warm light. "I suppose you think I'm very 
brazen. Or très fou. Or something." 

"Not at all." 
She seemed disappointed. "Yes, you do. Everybody does. I don't mind. It's useful." 
She sat down on one of the rickety red-velvet chairs, curved her legs underneath 
her,  and  glanced  round  the  room,  her  eyes  puckering  more  pronouncedly.  "How  can 
you bear it? It's a chamber of horrors." 

"Oh, you get used to anything," I said, annoyed with myself, for actually I was proud 

of the place. 

"I  don't.  I'll  never  get  used  to  anything.  Anybody  that  does,  they  might  as  well  be 

dead." Her dispraising eyes surveyed the room again. "What do you do here all day?" 

I motioned toward a table tall with books and paper. "Write things." 
"I thought writers were quite old. Of course Saroyan isn't old. I met him at a party, 
and really he isn't old at all. In fact," she mused, "if he'd give himself a closer shave ... 
by the way, is Hemingway old?" 
"In his forties, I should think." 
"That's not bad. I can't get excited by a man until he's forty-two. I know this idiot girl 
who  keeps  telling  me  I  ought  to  go  to  a  head-shrinker;  she  says  I  have  a  father 
complex. Which is so much merde. I simply trained myself to like older men, and it was 
the smartest thing I ever did. How old is W. Somerset Maugham?" 

"I'm not sure. Sixty-something." 
"That's not bad. I've never been to bed with a writer. No, wait: do you know Benny 
Shacklett?" She frowned when I shook my head. "That's funny. He's written an awful lot 
of radio stuff. But quel rat. Tell me, are you a real writer?" 

"It depends on what you mean by real." 
"Well, darling, does anyone buy what you write?" 
"Not yet." 
"I'm  going  to  help  you,"  she  said.  "I  can,  too.  Think  of  all  the  people  I  know  who 
know  people.  I'm  going  to  help  you  because  you  look  like  my  brother  Fred.  Only 
smaller. I haven't seen him since I was fourteen, that's when I left home, and he was 

 

5 

already six-feet-two. My other brothers were more your size, runts. It was the peanut 
butter  that  made  Fred  so  tall.  Everybody  thought  it  was  dotty,  the  way  he  gorged 
himself on peanut butter; he didn't care about anything in this world except horses and 
peanut butter. But he wasn't dotty, just sweet and vague and terribly slow; he'd been in 
the  eighth  grade  three  years  when  I  ran  away.  Poor  Fred.  I  wonder  if  the  Army's 
generous with their peanut butter. Which reminds me, I'm starving." 

I pointed to a bowl of apples, at the same time asked her how and why she'd left 
home so young. She looked at me blankly, and rubbed her nose, as though it tickled: a 
gesture,  seeing  often  repeated,  I  came  to  recognize  as  a  signal  that  one  was 
trespassing.  Like  many  people  with  a  bold  fondness  for  volunteering  intimate 
information,  anything  that  suggested  a  direct  question,  a  pinning-down,  put  her  on 
guard. She took a bite of apple, and said: "Tell me something you've written. The story 
part." 

"That's one of the troubles. They're not the kind of stories you can tell." 
"Too dirty?" 
"Maybe I'll let you read one sometime." 
"Whiskey and apples go together. Fix me a drink, darling. Then you can read me a 

story yourself." 

Very few authors, especially the unpublished, can resist an invitation to read aloud. 
I made us both a drink and, settling in a chair opposite, began to read to her, my voice 
a little shaky with a combination of stage fright and enthusiasm: it was a new story, I'd 
finished it the day before, and that inevitable sense of shortcoming had not had time to 
develop. It was about two women who share a house, schoolteachers, one of whom, 
when  the  other  becomes  engaged,  spreads  with  anonymous  notes  a  scandal  that 
prevents the marriage. As I read, each glimpse I stole of Holly made my heart contract. 
She  fidgeted.  She  picked  apart  the  butts  in  an  ashtray,  she  mooned  over  her 
fingernails, as though longing for a file; worse, when I did seem to have her interest, 
there was actually a telltale frost over her eyes, as if she were wondering whether to 
buy a pair of shoes she'd seen in some window. 

"Is that the end?" she asked, waking up. She floundered for something more to say. 
"Of course I like dykes themselves. They don't scare me a bit. But stories about dykes 
bore the bejesus out of me. I just can't put myself in their shoes. Well really, darling," 
she  said,  because  I  was  clearly  puzzled,  "if  it's  not  about  a  couple  of  old  bull-dykes, 
what the hell is it about?" 

But  I  was  in  no mood  to  compound  the  mistake  of having read  the story  with  the 
further embarrassment of explaining it. The same vanity that had led to such exposure, 
now forced me to mark her down as an insensitive, mindless show-off. 

"Incidentally," she said, "do you happen to know any nice lesbians? I'm looking for a 
roommate.  Well,  don't  laugh.  I'm  so  disorganized,  I  simply  can't  afford  a  maid;  and 
really, dykes are wonderful home-makers, they love to do all the work, you never have 

to bother about brooms and defrosting and sending out the laundry. I had a roommate 
in Hollywood, she played in Westerns, they called her the Lone Ranger; but I'll say this 
for her, she was better than a man around the house. Of course people couldn't help 
but think I must be a bit of a dyke myself. And of course I am. Everyone is: a bit. So 
what? That never discouraged a man yet, in fact it seems to goad them on. Look at the 
Lone Ranger, married twice. Usually dykes only get married once, just for the name. It 
seems to carry such cachet later on to be called Mrs. Something Another. That's not 
true!" She was staring at an alarm clock on the table. "It can't be four-thirty!" 

The window was turning blue. A sunrise breeze bandied the curtains. 
"What is today?" 
"Thursday." 
"Thursday." She stood up. "My God," she said, and sat down again with a moan. 

"It's too gruesome." 

I was tired enough not to be curious. I lay down on the bed and closed my eyes. 

Still it was irresistible: "What's gruesome about Thursday?" 

"Nothing.  Except  that  I  can  never  remember  when  it's  coming.  You  see,  on 
Thursdays I have to catch the eight forty-five. They're so particular about visiting hours, 
so if you're there by ten that gives you an hour before the poor men eat lunch. Think of 
it, lunch at eleven. You can go at two, and I'd so much rather, but he likes me to come 
in the morning, he says it sets him up for the rest of the day. I've got to stay awake," 
she said, pinching her cheeks until the roses came, "there isn't time to sleep, I'd look 
consumptive, I'd sag like a tenement, and that wouldn't be fair: a girl can't go to Sing 
Sing with a green face." 

"I suppose not." The anger I felt at her over my story was ebbing; she absorbed me 

again. 

"All the visitors do make an effort to look their best, and it's very tender, it's sweet 
as hell, the way the women wear their prettiest everything, I mean the old ones and the 
really poor ones too, they make the dearest effort to look nice and smell nice too, and I 
love  them  for  it.  I  love  the  kids  too,  especially  the  colored  ones.  I  mean  the  kids  the 
wives  bring.  It  should  be  sad,  seeing  the  kids  there,  but  it  isn't,  they  have  ribbons  in 
their hair and lots of shine on their shoes, you'd think there was going to be ice cream; 
and sometimes that's what it's like in the visitors' room, a party. Anyway it's not like the 
movies:  you  know,  grim  whisperings  through  a  grille.  There  isn't  any  grille,  just  a 
counter between you and them, and the kids can stand on it to be hugged; all you have 
to do to kiss somebody is lean across. What I like most, they're so happy to see each 
other,  they've  saved  up  so  much  to  talk  about,  it  isn't  possible  to  be  dull,  they  keep 
laughing and holding hands. It's different afterwards," she said. "I see them on the train. 
They sit so quiet watching the river go by." She stretched a strand of hair to the corner 
of her mouth and nibbled it thoughtfully. "I'm keeping you awake. Go to sleep." 

"Please. I'm interested."

"I know you are. That's why I want you to go to sleep. Because if I keep on, I'll tell 
you about Sally. I'm not sure that would be quite cricket." She chewed her hair silently. 
"They never told me not to tell anyone. In so many words. And it is funny. Maybe you 
could  put  it  in  a  story  with  different  names  and  whatnot.  Listen,  Fred,"  she  said, 
reaching for another apple, "you've got to cross your heart and kiss your elbow -- " 

Perhaps contortionists can kiss their elbow; she had to accept an approximation. 
"Well,"  she  said,  with  a  mouthful  of  apple,  "you  may  have  read  about  him  in  the 
papers. His name is Sally Tomato, and I speak Yiddish better than he speaks English; 
but he's a darling old man, terribly pious. He'd look like a monk if it weren't for the gold 
teeth; he says he prays for me every night. Of course he was never my lover; as far as 
that goes, I never knew him until he was already in jail. But I adore him now, after all 
I've been going to see him every Thursday for seven months, and I think I'd go even if 
he didn't pay me. This one's mushy," she said, and aimed the rest of the apple out the 
window. "By the way, I did know Sally by sight. He used to come to Joe Bell's bar, the 
one around the corner: never talked to anybody, just stand there, like the kind of man 
who lives in hotel rooms. But it's funny to remember back and realize how closely he 
must have been watching me, because right after they sent him up (Joe Bell showed 
me his picture in the paper. Blackhand. Mafia. All that mumbo jumbo: but they gave him 
five years) along came this telegram from a lawyer. It said to contact him immediately 
for information to my advantage." 

"You thought somebody had left you a million?" 
"Not at all. I figured Bergdorf was trying to collect. But I took the gamble and went to 
see  this  lawyer  (if  he  is  a  lawyer,  which  I  doubt,  since  he  doesn't  seem  to  have  an 
office,  just  an  answering  service,  and  he  always  wants  to  meet  you  in  Hamburg 
Heaven:  that's  because  he's  fat,  he  can  eat  ten  hamburgers  and  two  bowls  of  relish 
and a whole lemon meringue pie). He asked me how I'd like to cheer up a lonely old 
man, at the same time pick up a hundred a week. I told him look, darling, you've got the 
wrong Miss Golightly, I'm not a nurse that does tricks on the side. I wasn't impressed by 
the honorarium either; you can do as well as that on trips to the powder room: any gent 
with the slightest chic will give you fifty for the girl's john, and I always ask for cab fare 
too, that's another fifty. But then he told me his client was Sally Tomato. He said dear 
old Sally had long admired me à la distance, so wouldn't it be a good deed if I went to 
visit him once a week. Well, I couldn't: it was too romantic." 

"I don't know. It doesn't sound right." 
She smiled. "You think I'm lying?" 
"For one thing, they can't simply let anyone visit a prisoner." 
"Oh, they don't. In fact they make quite a boring fuss. I'm supposed to be his niece." 
"And  it's  as  simple  as  that?  For  an  hour's  conversation  he  gives  you  a  hundred 

dollars?" 

"He doesn't, the lawyer does. Mr. O'Shaughnessy mails it to me in cash as soon as 

I leave the weather report." 

"I think you could get into a lot of trouble," I said, and switched off a lamp; there was 
no  need  of  it  now,  morning  was  in  the  room  and  pigeons  were  gargling  on  the  fire 
escape. 

"How?" she said seriously. 
"There must be something in the law books about false identity. After all, you're not 

his niece. And what about this weather report?" 

She  patted  a  yawn.  "But  it's  nothing.  Just  messages  I  leave  with  the  answering 
service so Mr. O'Shaughnessy will know for sure that I've been up there. Sally tells me 
what to say, things like, oh, 'there's a hurricane in Cuba' and 'it's snowing in Palermo.' 
Don't  worry,  darling,"  she  said,  moving  to  the  bed,  "I've  taken  care  of  myself  a  long 
time." The morning light seemed refracted through her: as she pulled the bed covers up 
to my chin she gleamed like a transparent child; then she lay down beside me. "Do you 
mind? I only want to rest a moment. So let's don't say another word. Go to sleep." 

I  pretended  to,  I  made  my  breathing  heavy  and  regular.  Bells  in  the  tower  of  the 
next-door church rang the half-hour, the hour. It was six when she put her hand on my 
arm, a fragile touch careful not to waken. "Poor Fred," she whispered, and it seemed 
she  was  speaking  to  me,  but  she  was  not.  "Where  are  you,  Fred?  Because it's  cold. 
There's snow in the wind." Her cheek came to rest against my shoulder, a warm damp 
weight. 

"Why are you crying?" 
She  sprang  back,  sat  up.  "Oh,  for  God's  sake,"  she  said,  starting  for  the  window 

and the fire escape, "I hate snoops." 

 
The next day, Friday, I came home to find outside my door a grand-luxe Charles & 
Co. basket with her card: Miss Holiday Golightly, Traveling: and scribbled on the back 
in a freakishly awkward, kindergarten hand: Bless you darling Fred. Please forgive the 
other night. You were an angel about the whole thing. Mille tendresse -- Holly. P.S. I 
won't bother you again. I replied, Please do, and left this note at her door with what I 
could  afford,  a  bunch  of  street-vendor  violets.  But  apparently  she'd  meant  what  she 
said; I neither saw nor heard from her, and I gathered she'd gone so far as to obtain a 
downstairs key. At any rate she no longer rang my bell. I missed that; and as the days 
merged I began to feel toward her certain far-fetched resentments, as if I were being 
neglected  by  my  closest  friend.  A  disquieting  loneliness  came  into  my  life,  but  it 
induced no hunger for friends of longer acquaintance: they seemed now like a salt-free, 
sugarless  diet.  By  Wednesday  thoughts  of  Holly,  of  Sing  Sing  and  Sally  Tomato,  of 
worlds where men forked over fifty dollars for the powder room, were so constant that I 
couldn't work. That night I left a message in her mailbox: Tomorrow is Thursday. The 
next  morning  rewarded  me  with  a  second  note  in  the  play-pen  script:  Bless  you  for 
reminding me. Can you stop for a drink tonight 6-ish?

I waited until ten past six, then made myself delay five minutes more. 
A creature answered the door. He smelled of cigars and Knize cologne. His shoes 
sported  elevated  heels;  without  these  added  inches,  one  might  have  taken  him  for  a 
Little  Person.  His  bald  freckled  head  was  dwarf-big:  attached  to  it  were  a  pair  of 
pointed, truly elfin ears. He had Pekingese eyes, unpitying and slightly bulged. Tufts of 
hair sprouted from his ears, from his nose; his jowls were gray with afternoon beard, 
and his handshake almost furry. 

"Kid's in the shower," he said, motioning a cigar toward a sound of water hissing in 
another  room.  The  room  in  which  we  stood  (we  were  standing  because  there  was 
nothing  to  sit  on)  seemed  as  though  it  were  being  just  moved  into;  you  expected  to 
smell  wet  paint.  Suitcases  and  unpacked  crates  were  the  only  furniture.  The  crates 
served  as  tables.  One  supported  the  mixings  of  a  martini;  another  a  lamp,  a 
Libertyphone, Holly's red cat and a bowl of yellow roses. Bookcases, covering one wall, 
boasted a half-shelf of literature. I warmed to the room at once, I liked its fly-by-night 
look. 

The man cleared his throat. "You expected?" 
He found my nod uncertain. His cold eyes operated on me, made neat, exploratory 
incisions. "A lot of characters come here, they're not expected. You know the kid long?" 

"Not very." 
"So you don't know the kid long?" 
"I live upstairs." 
The answer seemed to explain enough to relax him. "You got the same layout?" 
"Much smaller." 
He tapped ash on the floor. "This is a dump. This is unbelievable. But the kid don't 
know  how  to  live  even  when  she's  got  the  dough."  His  speech  had  a  jerky  metallic 
rhythm, like a teletype. "So," he said, "what do you think: is she or ain't she?" 

"Ain't she what?" 
"A phony." 
"I wouldn't have thought so." 
"You're wrong. She is a phony. But on the other hand you're right. She isn't a phony 
because she's a real phony. She believes all this crap she believes. You can't talk her 
out  of  it.  I've  tried  with  tears  running  down  my  cheeks.  Benny  Polan,  respected 
everywhere, Benny Polan tried. Benny had it on his mind to marry her, she don't go for 
it, Benny spent maybe thousands sending her to head-shrinkers. Even the famous one, 
the one can only speak German, boy, did he throw in the towel. You can't talk her out 
of these" -- he made a fist, as though to crush an intangible -- "ideas. Try it sometime. 
Get  her  to  tell  you  some  of  the  stuff  she  believes.  Mind you,"  he  said,  "I like  the  kid. 
Everybody does, but there's lots that don't. I do. I sincerely like the kid. I'm sensitive, 
that's why. You've got to be sensitive to appreciate her: a streak of the poet. But I'll tell 
you the truth. You can beat your brains out for her, and she'll hand you horseshit on a 

platter. To give an example -- who is she like you see her today? She's strictly a girl 
you'll read where she ends up at the bottom of a bottle of Seconals. I've seen it happen 
more times than you've got toes: and those kids, they weren't even nuts. She's nuts." 

"But young. And with a great deal of youth ahead of her." 
"If  you  mean  future,  you're  wrong  again.  Now  a  couple  of years  back,  out  on  the 
Coast, there was a time it could've been different. She had something working for her, 
she had them interested, she could've really rolled. But when you walk out on a thing 
like  that,  you  don't  walk  back.  Ask  Luise  Rainer.  And  Rainer  was  a  star.  Sure,  Holly 
was no star; she never got out of the still department. But that was before The Story of 
Dr. Wassell. Then she could've really rolled. I know, see, cause I'm the guy was giving 
her the push." He pointed his cigar at himself. "O.J. Berman." 

He  expected  recognition,  and  I  didn't  mind  obliging  him,  it  was  all  right  by  me, 
except I'd never heard of O.J. Berman. It developed that he was a Hollywood actor's 
agent. 

"I'm the first one saw her. Out at Santa Anita. She's hanging around the track every 
day. I'm interested: professionally. I find out she's some jock's regular, she's living with 
the shrimp. I get the jock told Drop It if he don't want conversation with the vice boys: 
see,  the  kid's  fifteen.  But  stylish:  she's  okay,  she  comes  across.  Even  when  she's 
wearing glasses this thick; even when she opens her mouth and you don't know if she's 
a  hillbilly  or  an  Okie  or  what.  I  still  don't.  My  guess,  nobody'll  ever  know  where  she 
came from. She's such a goddamn liar, maybe she don't know herself any more. But it 
took  us  a  year  to  smooth  out  that  accent.  How  we  did  it  finally,  we  gave  her  French 
lessons: after she could imitate French, it wasn't so long she could imitate English. We 
modeled her along the Margaret Sullavan type, but she could pitch some curves of her 
own, people were interested, big ones, and to top it all, Benny Polan, a respected guy, 
Benny wants to marry her. An agent could ask for more? Then wham! The Story of Dr. 
Wassell. You see that picture? Cecil B. DeMille. Gary Cooper. Jesus. I kill myself, it's 
all set: they're going to test her for the part of Dr. Wassell's nurse. One of his nurses, 
anyway. Then wham! The phone rings." He picked a telephone out of the air and held it 
to his ear. "She says, this is Holly, I say honey, you sound far away, she says I'm in 
New York, I say what the hell are you doing in New York when it's Sunday and you got 
the test tomorrow? She says I'm in New York cause I've never been to New York. I say 
get your ass on a plane and get back here, she says I don't want it. I say what's your 
angle, doll? She says you got to want it to be good and I don't want it, I say well, what 
the hell do you want, and she says when I find out you'll be the first to know. See what I 
mean: horseshit on a platter." 

The red cat jumped off its crate and rubbed against his leg. He lifted the cat on the 
toe of his shoe and gave him a toss, which was hateful of him except he seemed not 
aware of the cat but merely his own irritableness. 

"This  is  what  she  wants?" he  said,  flinging out  his  arms.  "A  lot of characters  they

aren't expected? Living off tips. Running around with bums. So maybe she could marry 
Rusty Trawler? You should pin a medal on her for that?" 

He waited, glaring. 
"Sorry, I don't know him." 
"You don't know Rusty Trawler, you can't know much about the kid. Bad deal," he 
said,  his  tongue  clucking  in  his  huge  head.  "I  was  hoping  you  maybe  had  influence. 
Could level with the kid before it's too late." 

"But according to you, it already is." 
He blew a smoke ring, let it fade before he smiled; the smile altered his face, made 
something gentle happen. "I could get it rolling again. Like I told you," he said, and now 
it sounded true, "I sincerely like the kid." 

"What  scandals  are  you  spreading,  O.J.?"  Holly  splashed  into  the  room,  a  towel 

more or less wrapped round her and her wet feet dripping footmarks on the floor. 

"Just the usual. That you're nuts. 
"Fred knows that already." 
"But you don't." 
"Light  me  a  cigarette,  darling,"  she  said,  snatching  off  a  bathing  cap  and  shaking 

her hair. "I don't mean you, O.J. You're such a slob. You always nigger-lip." 

She scooped up the cat and swung him onto her shoulder. He perched there with 
the balance of a bird, his paws tangled in her hair as if it were knitting yarn; and yet, 
despite these amiable antics, it was a grim cat with a pirate's cutthroat face; one eye 
was gluey-blind, the other sparkled with dark deeds. 

"O.J. is a slob," she told me, taking the cigarette I'd lighted. "But he does know a 

terrific lot of phone numbers. What's David O. Selznick's number, O.J.?" 

"Lay off." 
"It's not a joke, darling. I want you to call him up and tell him what a genius Fred is. 
He's  written  barrels  of  the  most  marvelous  stories.  Well,  don't  blush,  Fred:  you  didn't 
say you were a genius, I did. Come on, O.J. What are you going to do to make Fred 
rich?" 

"Suppose you let me settle that with Fred." 
"Remember,"  she  said,  leaving  us,  "I'm  his  agent.  Another  thing:  if  I  holler,  come 

zipper me up. And if anybody knocks, let them in." 

A  multitude  did.  Within  the  next  quarter-hour  a  stag  party  had  taken  over  the 
apartment,  several  of them  in  uniform.  I counted  two  Naval  officers  and  an  Air  Force 
colonel; but they were outnumbered by graying arrivals beyond draft status. Except for 
a  lack  of  youth,  the  guests  had  no  common  theme,  they  seemed  strangers  among 
strangers; indeed, each face, on entering, had struggled to conceal dismay at seeing 
others  there.  It  was  as  if  the  hostess  had  distributed  her  invitations  while  zigzagging 
through  various  bars;  which was  probably  the  case.  After the  initial  frowns,  however, 
they  mixed  without  grumbling,  especially  O.J.  Berman,  who  avidly  exploited  the  new 

company  to  avoid  discussing  my  Hollywood  future.  I  was  left  abandoned  by  the 
bookshelves; of the books there, more than half were about horses, the rest baseball. 
Pretending  an  interest  in  Horseflesh  and  How  to  Tell  It  gave  me  sufficiently  private 
opportunity for sizing Holly's friends. 

Presently  one  of  these  became  prominent.  He  was  a  middle-aged  child  that  had 
never  shed  its  baby  fat,  though  some  gifted  tailor  had  almost  succeeded  in 
camouflaging his plump and spankable bottom. There wasn't a suspicion of bone in his 
body; his face, a zero filled in with pretty miniature features, had an unused, a virginal 
quality:  it  was  as  if  he'd  been  born,  then  expanded,  his  skin  remaining  unlined  as  a 
blown-up  balloon,  and  his  mouth,  though  ready  for  squalls  and  tantrums,  a  spoiled 
sweet  puckering.  But  it  was  not  appearance  that  singled  him  out;  preserved  infants 
aren't all that rare. It was, rather, his conduct; for he was behaving as though the party 
were  his:  like  an  energetic  octopus,  he  was  shaking  martinis,  making  introductions, 
manipulating  the  phonograph.  In  fairness,  most  of  his  activities  were  dictated  by  the 
hostess herself: Rusty, would you mind; Rusty, would you please. If he was in love with 
her, then clearly he had his jealousy in check. A jealous man might have lost control, 
watching  her  as  she  skimmed  around  the  room,  carrying  her  cat  in  one  hand  but 
leaving the other free to straighten a tie or remove lapel lint; the Air Force colonel wore 
a medal that came in for quite a polish. 

The  man's  name  was  Rutherfurd  ("Rusty")  Trawler.  In  1908  he'd  lost  both  his 
parents,  his  father  the  victim  of  an  anarchist  and  his  mother  of  shock,  which  double 
misfortune had made Rusty an orphan, a millionaire, and a celebrity, all at the age of 
five. He'd been a stand-by of the Sunday supplements ever since, a consequence that 
had  gathered  hurricane  momentum  when,  still  a  schoolboy,  he  had  caused  his 
godfather-custodian  to  be  arrested  on  charges  of  sodomy.  After  that,  marriage  and 
divorce sustained his place in the tabloid-sun. His first wife had taken herself, and her 
alimony, to a rival of Father Divine's. The second wife seems unaccounted for, but the 
third had sued him in New York State with a full satchel of the kind of testimony that 
entails.  He  himself  divorced  the  last  Mrs.  Trawler,  his  principal  complaint  stating  that 
she'd started a mutiny aboard his yacht, said mutiny resulting in his being deposited on 
the Dry Tortugas. Though he'd been a bachelor since, apparently before the war he'd 
proposed to Unity Mitford, at least he was supposed to have sent her a cable offering to 
marry her if Hitler didn't. This was said to be the reason Winchell always referred to him 
as a Nazi; that, and the fact that he attended rallies in Yorkville. 

I was not told these things. I read them in The Baseball Guide, another selection off 
Holly's  shelf  which  she  seemed  to  use  for  a  scrapbook.  Tucked  between  the  pages 
were Sunday features, together with scissored snippings from gossip columns. Rusty 
Trawler  and  Holly  Golightly  two-on-the-aisle  at  "One  Touch  of  Venus"  preem.  Holly 
came  up  from  behind,  and  caught  me  reading:  Miss  Holiday  Golightly,  of  the  Boston 
Golightlys, making every day a holiday for the 24-karat Rusty Trawler.

"Admiring my publicity, or are you just a baseball fan?" she said, adjusting her dark 

about Tiffany's. Listen. You know those days when you've got the mean reds?" 

glasses as she glanced over my shoulder. 

I said, "What was this week's weather report?" 
She winked at me, but it was humorless: a wink of warning, "I'm all for horses, but I 
loathe baseball," she said, and the sub-message in her, voice was saying she wished 
me to forget she'd ever mentioned Sally Tomato. "I hate the sound of it on a radio, but I 
have to listen, it's part of my research. There're so few things men can talk about. If a 
man  doesn't  like  baseball,  then  he  must  like  horses,  and  if  he  doesn't  like  either  of 
them, well, I'm in trouble anyway: he don't like girls. And how are you making out with 
O.J.?" 

"We've separated by mutual agreement" 
"He's an opportunity, believe me." 
"I do believe you. But what have I to offer that would strike him as an opportunity?" 
She persisted. "Go over there and make him think he isn't funny-looking. He really 

can help you, Fred." 

"I understand you weren't too appreciative." She seemed puzzled until I said: "The 

Story of Doctor Wassell" 

"He's  still  harping?"  she  said,  and  cast  across  the  room  an  affectionate  look  at 
Berman. "But he's got a point, I should feel guilty. Not because they would have given 
me the part or because I would have been good: they wouldn't and I wouldn't. If I do 
feel guilty, I guess it's because I let him go on dreaming when I wasn't dreaming a bit. I 
was just vamping for time to make a few self-improvements: I knew damn well I'd never 
be  a  movie  star.  It's  too  hard;  and  if  you're  intelligent,  it's  too  embarrassing.  My 
complexes  aren't  inferior  enough:  being  a  movie  star  and  having  a  big  fat  ego  are 
supposed to go hand-in-hand; actually, it's essential not to have any ego at all. I don't 
mean I'd mind being rich and famous. 

That's very much on my schedule, and someday I'll try to get around to it; but if it 
happens, I'd like to have my ego tagging along. I want to still be me when I wake up 
one fine morning and have breakfast at Tiffany's. You need a glass," she said, noticing 
my empty hands. "Rusty! Will you bring my friend a drink?" 

She  was  still  hugging  the  cat.  "Poor  slob,"  she  said,  tickling  his  head,  "poor  slob 
without a name. It's a little inconvenient, his not having a name. But I haven't any right 
to give him one: he'll have to wait until he belongs to somebody. We just sort of took up 
by the river one day, we don't belong to each other: he's an independent, and so am I. I 
don't  want  to  own  anything  until  I  know  I've  found  the  place  where  me  and  things 
belong together. I'm not quite sure where that is just yet. But I know what it's like." She 
smiled, and let the cat drop to the floor. "It's like Tiffany's," she said. "Not that I give a 
hoot about jewelry. Diamonds, yes. But it's tacky to wear diamonds before you're forty; 
and even that's risky. They only look right on the really old girls. Maria Ouspenskaya. 
Wrinkles and bones, white hair and diamonds: I can't wait. But that's not why I'm mad 

"Same as the blues?" 
"No,"  she  said  slowly. "No,  the  blues  are  because  you're  getting  fat  or  maybe it's 
been  raining  too  long.  You're  sad,  that's  all.  But  the  mean  reds  are  horrible.  You're 
afraid  and  you  sweat  like  hell,  but  you  don't  know  what  you're  afraid  of.  Except 
something  bad  is  going  to  happen,  only  you  don't  know  what  it  is.  You've  had  that 
feeling?" 

"Quite often. Some people call it angst." 
"All right. Angst. But what do you do about it?" 
"Well, a drink helps." 
"I've tried that. I've tried aspirin, too. Rusty thinks I should smoke marijuana, and I 
did for a while, but it only makes me giggle. What I've found does the most good is just 
to get into a taxi and go to Tiffany's. It calms me down right away, the quietness and 
the  proud  look  of it;  nothing  very  bad  could  happen  to  you there,  not  with  those kind 
men in their nice suits, and that lovely smell of silver and alligator wallets. If I could find 
a real-life place that made me feel like Tiffany's, then I'd buy some furniture and give 
the cat a name. I've thought maybe after the war, Fred and I -- " She pushed up her 
dark  glasses,  and  her eyes,  the  differing  colors of  them, the  grays  and  wisps of  blue 
and green, had taken on a far-seeing sharpness. "I went to Mexico once. It's wonderful 
country for raising horses. I saw one place near the sea. Fred's good with horses." 

Rusty Trawler came carrying a martini; he handed it over without looking at me. "I'm 
hungry,"  he  announced,  and  his  voice,  retarded  as  the  rest  of  him,  produced  an 
unnerving  brat-whine  that  seemed  to  blame  Holly.  "It's  seven-thirty,  and  I'm  hungry. 
You know what the doctor said." 

"Yes, Rusty. I know what the doctor said." 
"Well, then break it up. Let's go." 
"I want you to behave, Rusty." She spoke softly, but there was a governess threat 
of punishment in her tone that caused an odd flush of pleasure, of gratitude, to pink his 
face. 

"You don't love me," he complained, as though they were alone.' 
"Nobody loves naughtiness." 
Obviously she'd said what he wanted to hear; it appeared to both excite and relax 

him. Still he continued, as though it were a ritual: "Do you love me?" 

She  patted  him.  "Tend  to  your  chores,  Rusty.  And  when  I'm  ready,  we'll  go  eat 

wherever you want." 

"Chinatown?" 
"But that doesn't mean sweet and sour spareribs. You know what the doctor said." 
As he returned to his duties with a satisfied waddle, I couldn't resist reminding her 

that she hadn't answered his question. "Do you love him?" 

"I  told  you:  you  can  make  yourself  love  anybody.  Besides,  he  had  a  stinking 

 

childhood." 

"If it was so stinking, why does he cling to it?" 
"Use  your  head.  Can't  you  see  it's  just  that  Rusty  feels  safer  in  diapers  than  he 
would in a skirt? Which is really the choice, only he's awfully touchy about it. He tried to 
stab  me  with  a  butter  knife  because  I  told  him  to  grow  up  and  face  the  issue,  settle 
down  and  play  house  with  a nice  fatherly  truck  driver.  Meantime,  I've  got  him  on  my 
hands; which is okay, he's harmless, he thinks girls are dolls, literally." 

"Thank God." 
"Well, if it were true of most men, I'd hardly be thanking God." 
"I meant thank God you're not going to marry Mr. Trawler." 
She lifted an eyebrow. "By the way, I'm not pretending I don't know he's rich. Even 
land in Mexico costs something. Now," she said, motioning me forward, "let's get hold 
of O.J." 

I  held  back  while  my  mind  worked  to  win  a  postponement.  Then  I  remembered: 

"Why Traveling?" 

"On my card?" she said, disconcerted. "You think it's funny?" 
"Not funny. Just provocative." 
She shrugged. "After all, how do I know where I'll be living tomorrow? So I told them 
to put Traveling. Anyway, it was a waste of money, ordering those cards. Except I felt I 
owed it to them to buy some little something. They're from Tiffany's." She reached for 
my martini, I hadn't touched it; she drained it in two swallows, and took my hand. "Quit 
stalling. You're going to make friends with O.J." 

An occurrence at the door intervened. It was a young woman, and she entered like 
a  wind-rush,  a  squall  of  scarves  and  jangling  gold.  "H-H-Holly,"  she  said,  wagging  a 
finger  as  she  advanced,  "you  miserable  h-h-hoarder.  Hogging  all  these  simply  r-r-
riveting m-m-men!" 

She  was  well  over  six  feet,  taller  than  most  men  there.  They  straightened  their 
spines,  sucked  in  their  stomachs;  there  was  a  general  contest  to  match  her  swaying 
height. 

Holly said, "What are you doing here?" and her lips were taut as drawn string. 
"Why, n-n-nothing, sugar. I've been upstairs working with Yunioshi. Christmas stuff 
for the Ba-ba-zaar. But you sound vexed, sugar?" She scattered a roundabout smile. 
"You b-b-boys not vexed at me for butting in on your p-p-party?" 

Rusty Trawler tittered. He squeezed her arm, as though to admire her muscle, and 

asked her if she could use a drink. 

"I surely could," she said. "Make mine bourbon." 
Holly told her, "There isn't any." Whereupon the Air Force colonel suggested he run 

out for a bottle. 

"Oh,  I  declare,  don't  let's  have  a  f-f-fuss.  I'm  happy  with  ammonia.  Holly,  honey," 
she said, slightly shoving her, "don't you bother about me. I can introduce myself." She 

10

stooped  toward  O.J.  Berman,  who,  like  many  short  men  in  the  presence  of  tall 
women, had an aspiring mist in his eye. "I'm Mag W-w-wildwood, from Wild-w-w-wood, 
Arkansas. That's hill country." 

It  seemed  a  dance,  Berman performing  some  fancy  footwork  to  prevent  his  rivals 
cutting in. He lost her to a quadrille of partners who gobbled up her stammered jokes 
like popcorn tossed to pigeons. It was a comprehensible success. She was a triumph 
over  ugliness,  so  often  more  beguiling  than  real  beauty,  if  only  because  it  contains 
paradox.  In  this  case,  as  opposed  to  the  scrupulous  method  of  plain  good  taste  and 
scientific  grooming,  the  trick  had  been  worked  by  exaggerating  defects;  she'd  made 
them ornamental by admitting them boldly. Heels that emphasized her height, so steep 
her ankles trembled; a flat tight bodice that indicated she could go to a beach in bathing 
trunks; hair that was pulled straight back, accentuating the spareness, the starvation of 
her  fashion-model  face.  Even  the  stutter,  certainly  genuine  but  still  a  bit  laid  on,  had 
been turned to advantage. It was the master stroke, that stutter; for it contrived to make 
her  banalities  sound  somehow  original,  and  secondly,  despite  her  tallness,  her 
assurance,  it  served  to  inspire  in  male  listeners  a  protective  feeling.  To  illustrate: 
Berman  had  to  be  pounded  on  the  back  because  she  said,  "Who  can  tell  me  w-w-
where  is  the  j-j-john?";  then,  completing  the  cycle,  he  offered  an  arm  to  guide  her 
himself. 

"That," said Holly, "won't be necessary. She's been here before. She knows where 
it  is."  She  was  emptying  ashtrays,  and  after  Mag  Wildwood  had  left  the  room,  she 
emptied  another,  then  said,  sighed  rather:  "It's  really  very  sad."  She  paused  long 
enough  to  calculate  the  number  of  inquiring  expressions;  it  was  sufficient.  "And  so 
mysterious. You'd think it would show more. But heaven knows, she looks healthy. So, 
well, clean. That's the extraordinary part. Wouldn't you," she asked with concern, but of 
no one in particular, "wouldn't you say she looked clean?" 

Someone coughed, several swallowed. A Naval officer, who had been holding Mag 

Wildwood's drink, put it down. 

"But  then,"  said  Holly,  "I  hear  so  many  of  these  Southern  girls  have  the  same 

trouble." She shuddered delicately, and went to the kitchen for more ice. 

Mag Wildwood couldn't understand it, the abrupt absence of warmth on her return; 
the conversations she began behaved like green logs, they fumed but would not fire. 
More unforgivably, people were leaving without taking her telephone number. The Air 
Force colonel decamped while her back was turned, and this was the straw too much: 
he'd asked her to dinner. Suddenly she was blind. And since gin to artifice bears the 
same relation as tears to mascara, her attractions at once dissembled. She took it out 
on everyone. She called her hostess a Hollywood degenerate. She invited a man in his 
fifties to fight. She told Berman, Hitler was right. She exhilarated Rusty Trawler by stiff-
arming him into a corner. "You know what's going to happen to you?" she said, with no 
hint of a stutter. "I'm going to march you over to the zoo and feed you to the yak." He

looked altogether willing, but she disappointed him by sliding to the floor, where she sat 
humming. 

soldiers.  There's  a  statue  of  Papadaddy  Wildwood  smack  in  the  center  of 
Wildwood." 

"You're a bore. Get up from there," Holly said, stretching on a pair of gloves. The 
remnants of the party were waiting at the door, and when the bore didn't budge Holly 
cast me an apologetic glance. "Be an angel, would you, Fred? Put her in a taxi. She 
lives at the Winslow." 

"Don't. Live Barbizon. Regent 4-5700. Ask for Mag Wildwood." 
"You are an angel, Fred." 
They  were  gone.  The  prospect  of  steering  an  Amazon  into  a  taxi  obliterated 
whatever  resentment  I  felt.  But  she  solved  the  problem  herself.  Rising  on  her  own 
steam, she stared down at me with a lurching loftiness. She said, "Let's go Stork. Catch 
lucky  balloon,"  and  fell  full-length  like  an  axed  oak.  My  first  thought  was  to  run  for  a 
doctor.  But  examination  proved  her  pulse  fine  and  her  breathing  regular.  She  was 
simply asleep. After finding a pillow for her head, I left her to enjoy it. 

 
The following afternoon I collided with Holly on the stairs. "You" she said, hurrying 
past  with  a  package  from  the  druggist.  "There  she  is,  on  the  verge  of  pneumonia.  A 
hang-over out to here. And the mean reds on top of it." I gathered from this that Mag 
Wildwood  was  still  in  the  apartment,  but  she  gave  me  no  chance  to  explore  her 
surprising sympathy. Over the weekend, mystery deepened. First, there was the Latin 
who came to my door: mistakenly, for he was inquiring after Miss Wildwood. It took a 
while to correct his error, our accents seemed mutually incoherent, but by the time we 
had I was charmed. He'd been put together with care, his brown head and bullfighter's 
figure had an exactness, a perfection, like an apple, an orange, something nature has 
made just right. Added to this, as decoration, were an English suit and a brisk cologne 
and, what is still more unlatin, a bashful manner. The second event of the day involved 
him  again.  It  was  toward  evening,  and  I  saw  him  on  my  way  out  to  dinner.  He  was 
arriving in a taxi; the driver helped him totter into the house with a load of suitcases. 
That gave me something to chew on: by Sunday my jaws were quite tired. 

Then the picture became both darker and clearer. 
Sunday was an Indian summer day, the sun was strong, my window was open, and 
I heard voices on the fire escape. Holly and Mag were sprawled there on a blanket, the 
cat  between  them.  Their  hair,  newly  washed,  hung  lankly.  They  were  busy,  Holly 
varnishing her toenails, Mag knitting on a sweater. Mag was speaking. 

"If  you  ask  me,  I  think  you're  l-l-lucky.  At  least  there's  one  thing  you  can  say  for 

Rusty. He's an American." 

"Bully for him." 
"Sugar. There's a war on." 
"And when it's over, you've seen the last of me, boy." 
"I don't feel that way. I'm p-p-proud of my country. The men in my family were great 

"Fred's a soldier," said Holly. "But I doubt if he'll ever be a statue. Could be. They 

say the more stupid you are the braver. He's pretty stupid." 

"Fred's that boy upstairs? I didn't realize he was a soldier. But he does look stupid." 
"Yearning.  Not  stupid.  He  wants  awfully  to  be  on  the  inside  staring  out:  anybody 
with their nose pressed against a glass is liable to look stupid. Anyhow, he's a different 
Fred. Fred's my brother." 

"You call your own f-f-flesh and b-b-blood stupid?" 
"If he is he is." 
"Well, it's poor taste to say so. A boy that's fighting for you and me and all of us." 
"What is this: a bond rally?" 
"I just want you to know where I stand. I appreciate a joke, but underneath I'm a s-s-
serious  person.  Proud  to  be an  American.  That's  why I'm sorry about  José."  She  put 
down  her  knitting  needles.  "You  do  think  he's  terribly  good-looking,  don't  you?"  Holly 
said  Hmn,  and  swiped  the  cat's  whiskers  with  her  lacquer  brush.  "If  only  I  could  get 
used  to  the  idea  of  m-m-marrying  a  Brazilian.  And  being  a  B-b-brazilian  myself.  It's 
such a canyon to cross. Six thousand miles, and not knowing the language -- " 

"Go to Berlitz." 
"Why on earth would they be teaching P-p-portu-guese? It isn't as though anyone 
spoke  it.  No,  my  only  chance  is  to  try  and  make  José  forget  politics  and  become  an 
American. It's such a useless thing for a man to want to be: the p-p-president of Brazil." 
She sighed and picked up her knitting. "I must be madly in love. You saw us together. 
Do you think I'm madly in love?" 

"Well. Does he bite?" 
Mag dropped a stitch. "Bite?" 
"You. In bed." 
"Why, no. Should he?" Then she added, censoriously: "But he does laugh." 
"Good.  That's  the  right  spirit.  I  like  a  man  who  sees  the  humor;  most  of  them, 

they're all pant and puff." 

Mag  withdrew  her  complaint;  she  accepted  the  comment  as  flattery  reflecting  on 

herself. "Yes. I suppose." 

"Okay. He doesn't bite. He laughs. What else?" 
Mag counted up her dropped stitch and began again, knit, purl, purl. 
"I said -- " 
"I heard you. And it isn't that I don't want to tell you. But it's so difficult to remember. 
I don't d-d-dwell on these things. The way you seem to. They go out of my head like a 
dream. I'm sure that's the n-n-normal attitude." 

"It may be normal, darling; but I'd rather be natural." Holly paused in the process of 
reddening the rest of the cat's whiskers. "Listen. If you can't remember, try leaving the 

 

lights on." 

quite flashy: blond wood, tufted satin.

"Please understand me, Holly. I'm a very-very-very conventional person." 
"Oh, balls. What's wrong with a decent look at a guy you like? Men are beautiful, a 
lot  of  them  are,  José  is,  and  if  you  don't  even  want  to  look  at  him,  well,  I'd  say  he's 
getting a pretty cold plate of macaroni." 

"L-l-lower your voice." 
"You can't possibly be in love with him. Now. Does that answer your question?" 
"No. Because I'm not a cold plate of m-m-macaroni. I'm a warm-hearted person. It's 

She  left  the  door  of  the  bathroom  open,  and  conversed  from  there;  between  the 
flushing  and  the  brushing,  most  of  what  she  said  was  unintelligible,  but  the  gist  of  it 
was: she supposed I knew Mag Wildwood had moved in and wasn't that convenient? 
because if you're going to have a roommate, and she isn't a dyke, then the next best 
thing is a perfect fool, which Mag was, because then you can dump the lease on them 
and send them out for the laundry. 

One could see that Holly had a laundry problem; the room was strewn, like a girl's 

the basis of my character." 

gymnasium. 

"Okay. You've got a warm heart. But if I were a man on my way to bed, I'd rather 

take along a hot-water bottle. It's more tangible." 

"You  won't  hear  any  squawks  out  of  José,"  she  said  complacently,  her  needles 
flashing in the sunlight. "What's more, I am in love with him. Do you realize I've knitted 
ten pairs of Argyles in less than three months? And this is the second sweater." She 
stretched  the  sweater  and  tossed  it  aside.  "What's  the  point,  though?  Sweaters  in 
Brazil. I ought to be making s-s-sun helmets." 

Holly lay back and yawned. "It must be winter sometime." 
"It rains, that I know. Heat. Rain. J-j-jungles." 
"Heat. Jungles. Actually, I'd like that." 
"Better you than me." 
"Yes," said Holly, with a sleepiness that was not sleepy. "Better me than you." 
 
On Monday, when I went down for the morning mail, the card on Holly's box had 
been  altered,  a  name  added:  Miss  Golightly  and  Miss  Wildwood  were  now  traveling 
together. This might have held my interest longer except for a letter in my own mailbox. 
It was from a small university review to whom I'd sent a story. They liked it; and, though 
I must understand they could not afford to pay, they intended to publish. Publish: that 
meant  print.  Dizzy  with  excitement  is  no  mere  phrase.  I  had  to  tell  someone:  and, 
taking the stairs two at a time, I pounded on Holly's door. 

I didn't trust my voice to tell the news; as soon as she came to the door, her eyes 
squinty with sleep, I thrust the letter at her. It seemed as though she'd had time to read 
sixty pages before she handed it back. "I wouldn't let them do it, not if they don't pay 
you,"  she  said,  yawning.  Perhaps  my  face  explained  she'd  misconstrued,  that  I'd  not 
wanted advice but congratulations: her mouth shifted from a yawn into a smile. "Oh, I 
see. It's wonderful. Well, come in," she said. "Well make a pot of coffee and celebrate. 
No. I'll get dressed and take you to lunch." 

Her bedroom was consistent with her parlor: it perpetuated the same camping-out 
atmosphere;  crates  and  suitcases,  everything  packed  and  ready  to  go,  like  the 
belongings  of a  criminal  who feels  the  law  not  far  behind.  In  the  parlor  there  was  no 
conventional  furniture,  but  the  bedroom  had  the  bed  itself,  a  double  one  at  that,  and 

" -- and you know, she's quite a successful model: isn't that fantastic! But a good 
thing,"  she  said,  hobbling  out  of  the  bathroom  as  she  adjusted  a  garter.  "It  ought  to 
keep her out of my hair most of the day. And there shouldn't be too much trouble on the 
man front. She's engaged. Nice guy, too. Though there's a tiny difference in height: I'd 
say a foot, her favor. Where the hell -- " She was on her knees poking under the bed. 
After she'd found what she was looking for, a pair of lizard shoes, she had to search for 
a blouse, a belt, and it was a subject to ponder, how, from such wreckage, she evolved 
the eventual effect: pampered, calmly immaculate, as though she'd been attended by 
Cleopatra's maids. She said, "Listen," and cupped her hand under my chin, "I'm glad 
about the story. Really I am." 

 
That Monday in October, 1943. A beautiful day with the buoyancy of a bird. To start, 
we  had  Manhattans  at  Joe  Bell's;  and,  when  he  heard  of  my  good  luck,  champagne 
cocktails  on  the house.  Later,  we  wandered  toward  Fifth  Avenue,  where  there  was a 
parade. The flags in the wind, the thump of military bands and military feet, seemed to 
have nothing to do with war, but to be, rather, a fanfare arranged in my personal honor. 
We ate lunch at the cafeteria in the park. Afterwards, avoiding the zoo (Holly said 
she  couldn't  bear  to  see  anything  in  a  cage),  we  giggled,  ran,  sang  along  the  paths 
toward the old wooden boathouse, now gone. Leaves floated on the lake; on the shore, 
a  park-man  was  fanning  a  bonfire  of  them,  and  the  smoke,  rising  like  Indian  signals, 
was  the  only  smudge  on  the  quivering  air.  Aprils  have  never  meant  much  to  me, 
autumns seem that season of beginning, spring; which is how I felt sitting with Holly on 
the  railings  of  the  boathouse  porch.  I  thought  of  the  future,  and  spoke  of  the  past. 
Because Holly wanted to know about my childhood. She talked of her own, too; but it 
was  elusive,  nameless,  placeless,  an  impressionistic  recital,  though  the  impression 
received  was  contrary  to  what  one  expected,  for  she  gave  an  almost  voluptuous 
account  of  swimming  and  summer,  Christmas  trees,  pretty  cousins  and  parties:  in 
short, happy in a way that she was not, and never, certainly, the background of a child 
who had run away. 

Or, I asked, wasn't it true that she'd been out on her own since she was fourteen? 
She rubbed her nose. "That's true. The other isn't. But really, darling, you made such a 

 

13

tragedy out of your childhood I didn't feel I should compete." 

She  hopped  off  the  railing.  "Anyway,  it  reminds  me:  I  ought  to  send  Fred  some 
peanut  butter."  The  rest  of  the  afternoon  we  were  east  and  west  worming  out  of 
reluctant  grocers  cans  of  peanut  butter,  a  wartime  scarcity;  dark  came  before  we'd 
rounded up a half-dozen jars, the last at a delicatessen on Third Avenue. It was near 
the antique shop with the palace of a bird cage in its window, so I took her there to see 
it, and she enjoyed the point, its fantasy: "But still, it's a cage." 

Passing  a  Woolworth's,  she  gripped  my  arm:  "Let's  steal  something,"  she  said, 
pulling me into the store, where at once there seemed a pressure of eyes, as though 
we were already under suspicion. "Come on. Don't be chicken." She scouted a counter 
piled with paper pumpkins and Halloween masks. The saleslady was occupied with a 
group of nuns who were trying on masks. Holly picked up a mask and slipped it over 
her face; she chose another and put it on mine; then she took my hand and we walked 
away. It was as simple as that. Outside, we ran a few blocks, I think to make it more 
dramatic; but also because, as I'd discovered, successful theft exhilarates. I wondered 
if she'd often stolen. "I used to," she said. "I mean I had to. If I wanted anything. But I 
still do it every now and then, sort of to keep my hand in." We wore the masks all the 
way home. 

 
I have a memory of spending many hither and yonning days with Holly; and it's true, 
we did at odd moments see a great deal of each other; but on the whole, the memory is 
false. Because toward the end of the month I found a job: what is there to add? The 
less  the  better,  except  to  say  it  was  necessary  and  lasted  from  nine  to  five.  Which 
made  our  hours,  Holly's  and  mine,  extremely  different.  Unless  it  was  Thursday,  her 
Sing  Sing  day,  or  unless  she'd  gone  horseback  riding  in  the  park,  as  she  did 
occasionally,  Holly  was  hardly  up  when  I  came  home.  Sometimes,  stopping  there,  I 
shared her wake-up coffee while she dressed for the evening. She was forever on her 
way out, not always with Rusty Trawler, but usually, and usually, too, they were joined 
by Mag Wildwood and the handsome Brazilian, whose name was José Ybarra-Jaegar: 
his mother was German. As a quartet, they struck an unmusical note, primarily the fault 
of  Ybarra-Jaegar,  who seemed  as  out  of  place in  their  company as  a violin in  a jazz 
band. He was intelligent, he was presentable, he appeared to have a serious link with 
his  work,  which  was  obscurely  governmental,  vaguely  important,  and  took  him  to 
Washington several days  a  week.  How,  then, could  he  survive  night  after  night  in  La 
Rue, El Morocco, listening to the Wildwood ch-ch-chatter and staring into Rusty's raw 
baby-buttocks face? Perhaps, like most of us in a foreign country, he was incapable of 
placing people, selecting a frame for their picture, as he would at home; therefore all 
Americans had to be judged in a pretty equal light, and on this basis his companions 
appeared  to  be  tolerable  examples  of  local  color  and  national  character.  That  would 
explain much; Holly's determination explains the rest. 

Late  one  afternoon,  while  waiting  for  a  Fifth  Avenue  bus,  I  noticed  a  taxi  stop 

across the street to let out a girl who ran up the steps of the Forty-second Street public 
library. She was through the doors before I recognized her, which was pardonable, for 
Holly  and  libraries  were  not  an  easy  association  to  make.  I  let  curiosity  guide  me 
between the lions, debating on the way whether I should admit following her or pretend 
coincidence. In the end I did neither, but concealed myself some tables away from her 
in the general reading room, where she sat behind her dark glasses and a fortress of 
literature she'd gathered at the desk. She sped from one book to the next, intermittently 
lingering on a page, always with a frown, as if it were printed upside down. She had a 
pencil poised above paper -- nothing seemed to catch her fancy, still now and then, as 
though for the hell of it, she made laborious scribblings. Watching her, I remembered a 
girl  I'd  known  in  school,  a  grind,  Mildred  Grossman.  Mildred:  with  her  moist  hair  and 
greasy spectacles, her stained fingers that dissected frogs and carried coffee to picket 
lines, her flat eyes that only turned toward the stars to estimate their chemical tonnage. 
Earth and air could not be more opposite than Mildred and Holly, yet in my head they 
acquired a Siamese twinship, and the thread of thought that had sewn them together 
ran  like  this:  the  average  personality  reshapes  frequently,  every  few  years  even  our 
bodies  undergo  a  complete  overhaul  --  desirable  or  not,  it  is  a  natural  thing  that  we 
should change. All right, here were two people who never would. That is what Mildred 
Grossman  had  in  common  with  Holly  Golightly.  They  would  never  change  because 
they'd been given their character too soon; which, like sudden riches, leads to a lack of 
proportion: the one had splurged herself into a top-heavy realist, the other a lopsided 
romantic. I imagined them in a restaurant of the future, Mildred still studying the menu 
for  its  nutritional  values,  Holly  still  gluttonous  for  everything  on  it.  It  would  never  be 
different. They would walk through life and out of it with the same determined step that 
took small notice of those cliffs at the left. Such profound observations made me forget 
where I was; I came to, startled to find myself in the gloom of the library, and surprised 
all over again to see Holly there. It was after seven, she was freshening her lipstick and 
perking  up  her  appearance  from  what  she  deemed  correct  for  a  library  to  what,  by 
adding  a  bit  of  scarf,  some  earrings,  she  considered  suitable  for  the  Colony.  When 
she'd  left,  I  wandered  over  to  the  table  where  her  books  remained;  they  were  what  I 
had wanted to see. South by Thunderbird. Byways of Brazil. The Political Mind of Latin 
America. And so forth. 

On Christmas Eve she and Mag gave a party. Holly asked me to come early and 
help trim the tree. I'm still not sure how they maneuvered that tree into the apartment. 
The top branches were crushed against the ceiling, the lower ones spread wall-to-wall; 
altogether it was not unlike the yuletide giant we see in Rockefeller Plaza. Moreover, it 
would have taken a Rockefeller to decorate it, for it soaked up baubles and tinsel like 
melting  snow.  Holly  suggested  she  run  out  to  Woolworth's  and  steal  some  balloons; 
she did: and they turned the tree into a fairly good show. We made a toast to our work,

and Holly said: "Look in the bedroom. There's a present for you." 

"That I hadn't slept with José? God, yes. I simply told -- but you know: made it 

I had one for her, too: a small package in my pocket that felt even smaller when I 
saw, square on the bed and wrapped with a red ribbon, the beautiful bird cage. "But, 
Holly! It's dreadful!" 

"I couldn't agree more; but I thought you wanted it." 
"The money! Three hundred and fifty dollars!" 
She shrugged. "A few extra trips to the powder room. Promise me, though. Promise 

you'll never put a living thing in it." 

I started to kiss her, but she held out her hand "Gimme," she said, tapping the bulge 

in my pocket. 

"I'm  afraid  it  isn't  much,"  and  it  wasn't:  a  St.  Christopher's  medal.  But  at  least  it 
came from Tiffany's. Holly was not a girl who could keep anything, and surely by now 
she has lost that medal, left it in a suitcase or some hotel drawer. But the bird cage is 
still mine. I've lugged it to New Orleans, Nantucket, all over Europe, Morocco, the West 
Indies.  Yet  I  seldom  remember  that  it  was  Holly  who  gave  it  to  me,  because  at  one 
point I chose to forget: we had a big falling-out, and among the objects rotating in the 
eye of our hurricane were the bird cage and O.J. Berman and my story, a copy of which 
I'd given Holly when it appeared in the university review. 

Sometime in February, Holly had gone on a winter trip with Rusty, Mag and José 
Ybarra-Jaegar. Our altercation happened soon after she returned. She was brown as 
iodine, her hair was sun-bleached to a ghost-color, she'd had a wonderful time: "Well, 
first  of  all  we  were  in  Key  West,  and  Rusty  got  mad  at  some  sailors,  or  vice  versa, 
anyway he'll have to wear a spine brace the rest of his life. Dearest Mag ended up in 
the  hospital,  too.  First-degree  sunburn.  Disgusting:  all  blisters  and  citronella.  We 
couldn't  stand  the  smell  of  her.  So  José  and  I  left  them  in  the  hospital  and  went  to 
Havana. He says wait till I see Rio; but as far as I'm concerned Havana can take my 
money right now. We had an irresistible guide, most of him Negro and the rest of him 
Chinese,  and  while  I  don't  go  much  for  one  or  the  other,  the  combination  was  fairly 
riveting: so I let him play kneesie under the table, because frankly I didn't find him at all 
banal; but then one night he took us to a blue movie, and what do you suppose? There 
he was on the screen. Of course when we got back to Key West, Mag was positive I'd 
spent the whole time sleeping with José. So was Rusty: but he doesn't care about that, 
he  simply  wants  to  hear  the  details.  Actually,  things  were  pretty  tense  until  I  had  a 
heart-to-heart with Mag." 

We were in the front room, where, though it was now nearly March, the enormous 
Christmas  tree,  turned  brown  and  scentless,  its  balloons  shriveled  as  an  old  cow's 
dugs,  still  occupied  most  of  the  space.  A  recognizable  piece  of  furniture  had  been 
added  to  the  room:  an  army  cot;  and  Holly,  trying  to  preserve  her  tropic  look,  was 
sprawled on it under a sun lamp. 

"And you convinced her?" 

sound like an agonized confession -- simply told her I was a dyke." 

"She couldn't have believed that." 
"The  hell  she  didn't.  Why  do  you  think  she  went  out  and  bought  this  army  cot? 
Leave it to me: I'm always top banana in the shock department. Be a darling, darling, 
rub some oil on my back." While I was performing this service, she said: "O.J. Berman's 
in town, and listen, I gave him your story in the magazine. He was quite impressed. He 
thinks maybe you're worth helping. But he says you're on the wrong track. Negroes and 
children: who cares?" 

"Not Mr. Berman, I gather." 
"Well, I agree with him. I read that story twice. Brats and niggers. Trembling leaves. 

Description. It doesn't mean anything." 

My hand, smoothing oil on her skin, seemed to have a temper of its own: it yearned 
to raise itself and come down on her buttocks. "Give me an example," I said quietly. "Of 
something that means something. In your opinion." 

"Wuthering Heights," she said, without hesitation. 
The urge in my hand was growing beyond control. "But that's unreasonable. You're 

talking about a work of genius." 

"It was, wasn't it? My wild sweet Cathy. God, I cried buckets. I saw it ten times." 
I  said,  "Oh"  with  recognizable  relief,  "oh"  with  a  shameful,  rising  inflection,  "the 

movie." 

Her  muscles  hardened,  the  touch  of  her  was  like  stone  warmed  by  the  sun. 
"Everybody has to feel superior to somebody," she said. "But it's customary to present 
a little proof before you take the privilege." 

"I  don't  compare  myself  to  you.  Or,  Berman.  Therefore  I  can't  feel  superior.  We 

want different things." 

"Don't you want to make money?" 
"I haven't planned that far." 
"That's how your stories sound. As though you'd written them without knowing the 
end. Well, I'll tell you: I you'd better make money. You have an expensive imagination. 
Not many people are going to buy you bird cages." 

"Sorry." 
"You will be if you hit me. You wanted to a minute ago: I could feel it in your hand; 

and you want to now." 

I did, terribly; my hand, my heart was shaking as I recapped the bottle of oil. "Oh no, 
I wouldn't regret that. I'm only sorry you wasted your money on me: Rusty Trawler is 
too hard a way of earning it." 

She sat up on the army cot, her face, her naked breasts coldly blue in the sun-lamp 
light. "It should take you about four seconds to walk from here to the door. I'll give you 
two."

I went straight upstairs, got the bird cage, took it down and left it in front of her door. 
That  settled  that.  Or  so  I  imagined  until  the  next  morning when,  as  I  was  leaving  for 
work, I saw the cage perched on a sidewalk ash-can waiting for the garbage collector. 
Rather sheepishly, I rescued it and carried it back to my room, a capitulation that did 
not  lessen  my  resolve  to  put  Holly  Golightly  absolutely  out  of  my  life.  She  was,  I 
decided, "a crude exhibitionist," "a time waster," "an utter fake": someone never to be 
spoken to again. 

And I didn't. Not for a long while. We passed each other on the stairs with lowered 
eyes.  If  she  walked  into  Joe  Bell's,  I  walked  out.  At  one  point,  Madame  Sapphia 
Spanella,  the  coloratura  and  roller-skating  enthusiast  who  lived  on  the  first  floor, 
circulated a petition among the brownstone's other tenants asking them to join her in 
having Miss Golightly evicted: she was, said Madame Spanella, "morally objectionable" 
and the "perpetrator of all-night gatherings that endangered the safety and sanity of her 
neighbors."  Though  I  refused  to  sign,  secretly  I  felt  Madame  Spanella  had  cause  to 
complain.  But  her  petition  failed,  and  as  April  approached  May,  the  open-windowed, 
warm spring nights were lurid with the party sounds, the loud-playing phonograph and 
martini laughter that emanated from Apt. 2. 

It  was  no  novelty  to  encounter  suspicious  specimens  among  Holly's  callers,  quite 
the  contrary;  but  one  day  late  that  spring,  while  passing  through  the  brownstone's 
vestibule,  I  noticed  a  very  provocative  man  examining  her  mailbox.  A  person  in  his 
early  fifties  with  a  hard,  weathered  face,  gray  forlorn  eyes.  He  wore  an  old  sweat-
stained gray hat, and his cheap summer suit, a pale blue, hung too loosely on his lanky 
frame; his shoes were brown and brandnew. He seemed to have no intention of ringing 
Holly's bell. Slowly, as though he were reading Braille, he kept rubbing a finger across 
the embossed lettering of her name. 

That evening, on my way to supper, I saw the man again. He was standing across 
the  street,  leaning  against  a  tree  and  staring  up  at  Holly's  windows.  Sinister 
speculations rushed through my head. Was he a detective? Or some underworld agent 
connected with her Sing Sing friend, Sally Tomato? The situation revived my tenderer 
feelings for Holly; it was only fair to interrupt our feud long enough to warn her that she 
was  being  watched.  As  I  walked  to  the  corner,  heading  east  toward  the  Hamburg 
Heaven at Seventy-ninth and Madison, I could feel the man's attention focused on me. 
Presently, without turning my head, I knew that he was following me. Because I could 
hear  him  whistling.  Not  any  ordinary  tune,  but  the  plaintive,  prairie  melody  Holly 
sometimes played on her guitar: Don't wanna sleep, don't wanna die, just wanna go a-
travelin' through the pastures of the sky. The whistling continued across Park Avenue 
and up Madison. Once, while waiting for a traffic light to change, I watched him out of 
the corner of my eye as he stooped to pet a sleazy Pomeranian. "That's a fine animal 
you got there," he told the owner in a hoarse, countrified drawl. 

Hamburg  Heaven  was  empty.  Nevertheless,  he  took  a  seat  right  beside  me  at 

the  long  counter.  He  smelled  of  tobacco  and  sweat.  He  ordered  a  cup  of  coffee,  but 
when it came he didn't touch it. Instead, he chewed on a toothpick and studied me in 
the wall mirror facing us. 

"Excuse me," I said, speaking to him via the mirror, "but what do you want?" 
The  question  didn't  embarrass  him;  he  seemed  relieved  to  have  had  it  asked. 

"Son," he said, "I need a friend." 

He  brought  out  a  wallet.  It  was  as  worn  as  his  leathery  hands,  almost  falling  to 
pieces; and so was the brittle, cracked, blurred snapshot he handed me. There were 
seven  people  in  the  picture,  all  grouped  together  on  the  sagging  porch  of  a  stark 
wooden house, and all children, except for the man himself, who had his arm around 
the waist of a plump blond little girl with a hand shading her eyes against the sun. 

"That's me," he said, pointing at himself. "That's her . . ." he tapped the plump girl. 
"And  this  one  over  here,"  he  added,  indicating  a  tow-headed  beanpole,  "that's  her 
brother, Fred." 

I  looked  at  "her"  again:  and  yes,  now  I  can  see  it,  an  embryonic  resemblance  to 
Holly in the squinting, fat-cheeked child. At the same moment, I realized who the man 
must be. 

"You're Holly's father." 
He blinked, he frowned. "Her name's not Holly. She was a Lulamae Barnes. Was," 
he said, shifting the toothpick in his mouth, "till she married me. I'm her husband. Doc 
Golightly.  I'm  a  horse  doctor,  animal  man.  Do  some  farming,  too.  Near  Tulip,  Texas. 
Son, why are you laughin'?" 

It  wasn't  real  laughter:  it  was  nerves.  I  took  a  swallow  of  water  and  choked;  he 
pounded me on the back. "This here's no humorous matter, son. I'm a tired man. I've 
been five years lookin' for my woman. Soon as I got that letter from Fred, saying where 
she was, I bought myself a ticket on the Greyhound. Lulamae belongs home with her 
husband and her churren." 

"Children?" 
"Them's  her  churren,"  he  said,  almost  shouted.  He  meant  the  four  other  young 
faces in the picture, two bare-footed girls and a pair of overalled boys. Well, of course: 
the man was deranged. "But Holly can't be the mother of those children. They're older 
than she is. Bigger." 

"Now, son," he said in a reasoning voice, "I didn't claim they was her natural-born 
churren. Their own precious mother, precious woman, Jesus rest her soul, she passed 
away  July  4th,  Independence  Day,  1936.  The  year  of  the  drought.  When  I  married 
Lulamae, that was in December, 1938, she was going on fourteen. Maybe an ordinary 
person, being only fourteen, wouldn't know their right mind. But you take Lulamae, she 
was  an  exceptional  woman.  She  knew  good-and-well  what  she  was  doing  when  she 
promised to be my wife and the mother of my churren. She plain broke our hearts when 

 

16

she  ran  off  like  she  done."  He  sipped  his  cold  coffee,  and  glanced  at  me  with  a 
searching earnestness. "Now, son, do you doubt me? Do you believe what I'm saying 
is so?" 

I  did.  It  was  too  implausible  not  to  be  fact;  moreover,  it  dovetailed  with  O.J. 
Berman's description of the Holly he'd first encountered in California: "You don't know 
whether  she's  a  hillbilly  or  an  Okie  or  what."  Berman  couldn't  be  blamed  for  not 
guessing that she was a child-wife from Tulip, Texas. 

"Plain broke our hearts when she ran off like she done," the horse doctor repeated. 
"She had no cause. All the housework was done by her daughters. Lulamae could just 
take it easy: fuss in front of mirrors and wash her hair. Our own cows, our own garden, 
chickens,  pigs:  son,  that  woman  got  positively  fat.  While  her  brother  growed  into  a 
giant. Which is a sight different from how they come to us. 'Twas Nellie, my oldest girl, 
'twas Nellie brought 'em into the house. She come to me one morning, and said: 'Papa, 
I  got  two  wild  yunguns  locked  in  the  kitchen.  I  caught  'em  outside  stealing  milk  and 
turkey  eggs.'  That  was  Lulamae  and  Fred.  Well,  you  never  saw  a  more  pitiful 
something.  Ribs  sticking  out  everywhere,  legs  so  puny  they  can't  hardly  stand,  teeth 
wobbling  so  bad  they  can't  chew  mush.  Story  was:  their  mother  died  of  the  TB,  and 
their papa done the same -- and all the churren, a whole raft of 'em, they been sent off 
to live with different mean people. Now Lulamae and her brother, them two been living 
with some mean, no-count people a hundred miles east of Tulip. She had good cause 
to run off from that house. She didn't have none to leave mine. Twas her home." He 
leaned  his  elbows  on  the  counter  and,  pressing  his  closed  eyes  with  his  fingertips, 
sighed.  "She  plumped  out  to  be  a  real  pretty  woman.  Lively,  too.  Talky  as  a  jaybird. 
With  something  smart  to  say  on  every  subject:  better  than  the  radio.  First  thing  you 
know,  I'm  out  picking  flowers.  I  tamed  her  a  crow  and  taught  it  to  say  her  name.  I 
showed  her  how  to  play  the  guitar.  Just  to  look  at  her  made  the  tears  spring  to  my 
eyes.  The  night  I  proposed,  I  cried  like  a  baby.  She  said:  'What  you  want  to  cry  for, 
Doc?  'Course  we'll  be married.  I've  never been  married  before.'  Well,  I  had  to  laugh, 
hug  and  squeeze  her:  never  been  married  before!"  He  chuckled,  chewed  on  his 
toothpick a moment. "Don't tell me that woman wasn't happy!" he said, challengingly. 
"We all doted on her. She didn't have to lift a finger, 'cept to eat a piece of pie. 'Cept to 
comb her hair and send away for all the magazines. We must've had a hunnerd dollars' 
worth  of  magazines  come  into  that  house.  Ask  me,  that's  what  done  it.  Looking  at 
show-off  pictures.  Reading  dreams.  That's  what  started  her  walking  down  the  road. 
Every  day  she'd  walk  a  little  further:  a  mile,  and  come  home.  Two  miles,  and  come 
home. One day she just kept on." He put his hands over his eyes again; his breathing 
made a ragged noise. "The crow I give her went wild and flew away. All summer you 
could hear him. In the yard. In the garden. In the woods. All summer that damned bird 
was calling: Lulamae, Lulamae." 

He  stayed  hunched  over  and  silent,  as  though  listening  to  the  long-ago  summer 

sound. I carried our checks to the cashier. While I was paying, he joined me. We left 
together  and  walked  over  to  Park  Avenue.  It  was  a  cool,  blowy  evening;  swanky 
awnings flapped in the breeze. The quietness between us continued until I said: "But 
what about her brother? He didn't leave?" 

"No, sir," he said, clearing his throat. "Fred was with us right till they took him in the 
Army. A fine boy. Fine with horses. He didn't know what got into Lulamae, how come 
she left her brother and husband and churren. After he was in the Army, though, Fred 
started hearing from her. The other day he wrote me her address. So I come to get her. 
I know he's sorry for what she done. I know she wants to go home." He seemed to be 
asking  me  to  agree  with  him.  I  told  him  that  I  thought  he'd  find  Holly,  or  Lulamae, 
somewhat changed. "Listen, son," he said, as we reached the steps of the brownstone, 
"I advised you I need a friend. Because I don't want to surprise her. Scare her none. 
That's why I've held off. Be my friend: let her know I'm here." 

The notion of introducing Mrs. Golightly to her husband had its satisfying aspects; 
and,  glancing  up  at  her  lighted  windows,  I  hoped  her  friends  were  there,  for  the 
prospect of watching the Texan shake hands with Mag and Rusty and José was more 
satisfying still. But Doc Golightly's proud earnest eyes and sweat-stained hat made me 
ashamed of such anticipations. He followed me into the house and prepared to wait at 
the  bottom  of  the  stairs.  "Do  I  look  nice?"  he  whispered,  brushing  his  sleeves, 
tightening the knot of his tie. 

Holly was alone. She answered the door at once; in fact, she was on her way out -- 
white satin dancing pumps and quantities of perfume announced gala intentions. "Well, 
idiot," she said, and playfully slapped me with her purse. "I'm in too much of a hurry to 
make up now. We'll smoke the pipe tomorrow, okay?" 

"Sure, Lulamae. If you're still around tomorrow." 
She took off her dark glasses and squinted at me. It was as though her eyes were 
shattered prisms, the dots of blue and gray and green like broken bits of sparkle. "He 
told you that," she said in a small, shivering voice. 

"Oh, please. Where is he?" She ran past me into the hall. "Fred!" she called down 

the stairs. "Fred! Where are you, darling?" 

I could hear Doc Golightly's footsteps climbing the stairs. His head appeared above 
the banisters, and Holly backed away from him, not as though she were frightened, but 
as though she were retreating into a shell of disappointment. Then he was standing in 
front of her, hangdog and shy. "Gosh, Lulamae," he began, and hesitated, for Holly was 
gazing at him vacantly, as though she couldn't place him. "Gee, honey," he said, "don't 
they feed you up here? You're so skinny. Like when I first saw you. All wild around the 
eye." 

Holly touched his face; her fingers tested the reality of his chin, his beard stubble. 
"Hello, Doc," she said gently, and kissed him on the cheek. "Hello, Doc," she repeated 
happily, as he lifted her off her feet in a rib-crushing grip. Whoops of relieved laughter 

 

17

shook him. "Gosh, Lulamae. Kingdom come." 

Blue Mountains by now." 

Neither of them noticed me when I squeezed past them and went up to my room. 
Nor  did  they  seem  aware  of  Madame  Sapphia  Spanella,  who  opened  her  door  and 
yelled: "Shut up! It's a disgrace. Do your whoring elsewhere." 

 
"Divorce him? Of course I never divorced him. I was only fourteen, for God's sake. It 
couldn't have been legal." Holly tapped an empty martini glass. "Two more, my darling 
Mr. Bell." 

Joe  Bell,  in  whose  bar  we  were  sitting,  accepted  the  order  reluctantly.  "You're 
rockin' the boat kinda early," he complained, crunching on a Tums. It was not yet noon, 
according  to  the  black  mahogany  clock  behind  the  bar,  and  he'd  already  served  us 
three rounds. 

"But it's Sunday, Mr. Bell. Clocks are slow on Sundays. Besides, I haven't been to 
bed yet," she told him, and confided to me: "Not to sleep." She blushed, and glanced 
away guiltily. For the first time since I'd known her, she seemed to feel a need to justify 
herself: "Well, I had to. Doc really loves me, you know. And I love him. He may have 
looked old and tacky to you. But you don't know the sweetness of him, the confidence 
he can give to birds and brats and fragile things like that. Anyone who ever gave you 
confidence, you  owe  them  a  lot.  I've  always  remembered Doc  in  my  prayers.  Please 
stop smirking!" she demanded, stabbing out a cigarette. "I do say my prayers." 

"I'm not smirking. I'm smiling. You're the most amazing person." 
"I suppose I am," she said, and her face, wan, rather bruised-looking in the morning 
light, brightened; she smoothed her tousled hair, and the colors of it glimmered like a 
shampoo advertisement. "I must look fierce. But who wouldn't? We spent the rest of the 
night roaming around in a bus station. Right up till the last minute Doc thought I was 
going  to  go  with  him.  Even  though  I  kept  telling  him:  But,  Doc,  I'm  not  fourteen  any 
more,  and  I'm  not  Lulamae.  But  the  terrible  part  is  (and  I  realized  it  while  we  were 
standing  there)  I  am.  I'm  still stealing  turkey  eggs  and  running  through  a  brier  patch. 
Only now I call it having the mean reds." 

Joe Bell disdainfully settled the fresh martinis in front of us. 
"Never love a wild thing, Mr. Bell," Holly advised him. "That was Doc's mistake. He 
was always lugging home wild things. A hawk with a hurt wing. One time it was a full-
grown bobcat with a broken leg. But you can't give your heart to a wild thing: the more 
you do, the stronger they get. Until they're strong enough to run into the woods. Or fly 
into a tree. Then a taller tree. Then the sky. That's how you'll end up, Mr. Bell. If you let 
yourself love a wild thing. You'll end up looking at the sky." 

"She's drunk," Joe Bell informed me. 
"Moderately,"  Holly  confessed.  "But  Doc  knew  what  I  meant.  I  explained  it  to  him 
very carefully, and it was something he could understand. We shook hands and held on 
to each other and he wished me luck." She glanced at the clock. "He must be in the 

"What's she talkin' about?" Joe Bell asked me. 
Holly lifted her martini. "Let's wish the Doc luck, too," she said, touching her glass 
against mine. "Good luck: and believe me, dearest Doc -- it's better to look at the sky 
than live there. Such an empty place; so vague. Just a country where the thunder goes 
and things disappear." 

 
TRAWLER MARRIES FOURTH. I was on a subway somewhere in Brooklyn when I 
saw that headline. The paper that bannered it belonged to another passenger. The only 
part of the text that I could see read: Rutherfurd "Rusty" Trawler, the millionaire playboy 
often accused of pro-Nazi sympathies, eloped to Greenwich yesterday with a beautiful -
- Not that I wanted to read any more. Holly had married him: well, well. I wished I were 
under the wheels of the train. But I'd been wishing that before I spotted the headline. 
For a headful of reasons. I hadn't seen Holly, not really, since our drunken Sunday at 
Joe  Bell's bar.  The intervening  weeks  had  given  me  my  own  case  of  the  mean  reds. 
First off, I'd been fired from my job: deservedly, and for an amusing misdemeanor too 
complicated  to  recount  here.  Also,  my  draft  board  was  displaying  an  uncomfortable 
interest; and, having so recently escaped the regimentation of a small town, the idea of 
entering another form of disciplined life made me desperate. Between the uncertainty 
of my draft status and a lack of specific experience, I couldn't seem to find another job. 
That  was  what  I  was  doing  on  a  subway  in  Brooklyn:  returning  from  a  discouraging 
interview with an editor of the now defunct newspaper, PM. All this, combined with the 
city heat of the summer, had reduced me to a state of nervous inertia. So I more than 
half meant it when I wished I were under the wheels of the train. The headline made 
the  desire  quite  positive.  If  Holly  could  marry  that  "absurd  foetus,"  then  the  army  of 
wrongness rampant in the world might as well march over me. Or, and the question is 
apparent, was my outrage a little the result of being in love with Holly myself? A little. 
For  I  was  in  love  with  her.  Just  as  I'd  once  been  in  love  with  my  mother's  elderly 
colored cook and a postman who let me follow him on his rounds and a whole family 
named McKendrick. That category of love generates jealousy, too. 

When  I  reached  my  station  I  bought  a  paper;  and,  reading  the  tail-end  of  that 
sentence, discovered that Rusty's bride was: a beautiful cover girl from the Arkansas 
hills, Miss Margaret Thatcher Fitzhue Wildwood. Mag! My legs went so limp with relief I 
took a taxi the rest of the way home. 

Madame Sapphia Spanella met me in the hall, wild-eyed and wringing her hands. 

"Run," she said. "Bring the police. She is killing somebody! Somebody is killing her!" 

It  sounded  like  it.  As  though  tigers  were  loose  in  Holly's  apartment.  A  riot  of 
crashing  glass,  of  rippings  and  callings  and  overturned  furniture.  But  there  were  no 
quarreling  voices  inside  the  uproar,  which  made  it  seem  unnatural.  "Run,"  shrieked 
Madame Spanella, pushing me. "Tell the police murder!" 

 

18

I  ran;  but  only  upstairs  to  Holly's  door.  Pounding  on  it  had  one  result:  the  racket 
subsided.  Stopped  altogether.  But  leading  to  let  me  in  went  unanswered,  and  my 
efforts to break down the door merely culminated in a bruised shoulder. Then below I 
heard Madame Spanella commanding some newcomer to go for the police. "Shut up," 
she was told, "and get out of my way." 

It  was  José  Ybarra-Jaegar.  Looking  not  at  all  the  smart  Brazilian  diplomat;  but 
sweaty  and  frightened.  He  ordered  me  out  of  his  way,  too.  And,  using  his  own  key, 
opened the door. "In here, Dr. Goldman," he said, beckoning to a man accompanying 
him. 

Since  no  one  prevented  me,  I  followed  them  into  the  apartment,  which  was 
tremendously wrecked. At last the Christmas tree had been dismantled, very literally: 
its  brown  dry  branches  sprawled  in  a  welter  of  torn-up  books,  broken  lamps  and 
phonograph  records.  Even  the  icebox  had  been  emptied,  its  contents  tossed  around 
the room: raw eggs were sliding down the walls and in the midst of the debris Holly's 
no-name cat was calmly licking a puddle of milk. 

In the bedroom, the smell of smashed perfume bottles made me gag. I stepped on 
Holly's  dark  glasses;  they  were  lying  on  the  floor,  the  lenses  already  shattered,  the 
frames cracked in half. Perhaps that is why Holly, a rigid figure on the bed, stared at 
José so blindly, seemed not to see the doctor, who, testing her pulse, crooned: "You're 
a tired young lady. Very tired. You want to go to sleep, don't you? Sleep." 

Holly rubbed her forehead, leaving a smear of blood from a cut finger. "Sleep," she 
said, and whimpered like an exhausted, fretful child. "He's the only one would ever let 
me. Let me hug him on cold nights. I saw a place in Mexico. With horses. By the sea." 

"With  horses  by  the  sea,"  lullabied  the  doctor,  selecting  from  his  black  case  a 

hypodermic. 

José averted his face, queasy at the sight of a needle. "Her sickness is only grief?" 
he asked, his difficult English lending the question an unintended irony. "She is grieving 
only?" 

"Didn't hurt a bit, now did it?" inquired the doctor, smugly dabbing Holly's arm with a 

scrap of cotton. 

She  came  to  sufficiently  to  focus  the  doctor.  "Everything  hurts.  Where  are  my 

glasses?" But she didn't need them. Her eyes were closing of their own accord. 

"She is only grieving?" insisted José. 
"Please, sir," the doctor was quite short with him, "if you will leave me alone with the 

patient." 

José  withdrew  to  the  front  room,  where  he  released  his  temper  on  the  snooping, 
tiptoeing  presence  of  Madame  Spanella.  "Don't  touch  me!  I'll  call  the  police,"  she 
threatened as he whipped her to the door with Portuguese oaths. 

He considered throwing me out, too; or so I surmised from his expression. Instead, 
he  invited  me  to  have  a  drink.  The  only  unbroken  bottle  we  could  find  contained  dry 

vermouth.  "I  have  a  worry,"  he  confided.  "I  have  a  worry  that  this  should  cause 
scandal.  Her  crashing  everything.  Conducting  like  a  crazy.  I  must  have  no  public 
scandal. It is too delicate: my name, my work." 

He  seemed  cheered  to  learn  that  I  saw  no  reason  for  a  "scandal";  demolishing 

one's own possessions was, presumably, a private affair. 

"It is only a question of grieving," he firmly declared. "When the sadness came, first 
she  throws  the  drink  she  is  drinking.  The  bottle.  Those  books.  A  lamp.  Then  I  am 
scared. I hurry to bring a doctor." 

"But why?" I wanted to know. "Why should she have a fit over, Rusty? If I were her, 

I'd celebrate." 

"Rusty?" 
I was still carrying my newspaper, and showed him the headline. 
"Oh, that." He grinned rather scornfully. "They do us a grand favor, Rusty and Mag. 
We laugh over it: how they think they break our hearts when all the time we want them 
to  run  away.  I  assure  you,  we  were  laughing  when  the  sadness  came."  His  eyes 
searched the litter on the floor; he picked up a ball of yellow paper. "This," he said. 

It  was  a  telegram  from  Tulip,  Texas:  Received  notice  young  Fred  killed  in  action 
overseas  stop  your  husband  and  children  join  in  the  sorrow  of  our  mutual  loss  stop 
letter  follows  love  Doc.  Holly  never  mentioned  her  brother  again:  except  once. 
Moreover, she stopped calling me Fred. June, July, all through the warm months she 
hibernated like a winter animal who did not know spring had come and gone. Her hair 
darkened, she put on weight. She became rather careless about her clothes: used to 
rush  round  to  the  delicatessen  wearing  a  rain-slicker  and  nothing  underneath.  José 
moved  into  the  apartment,  his  name  replacing  Mag  Wildwood's  on  the  mailbox.  Still, 
Holly was a good deal alone, for José stayed in Washington three days a week. During 
his  absences  she  entertained  no  one  and  seldom  left  the  apartment  --  except  on 
Thursdays, when she made her weekly trip to Ossining. 

Which is not to imply that she had lost interest in life; far from it, she seemed more 
content,  altogether  happier  than  I'd  ever  seen  her.  A  keen  sudden  un-Holly-like 
enthusiasm  for  homemaking  resulted  in  several  un-Holly-like  purchases:  at  a  Parke-
Bernet  auction  she  acquired  a  stag-at-bay  hunting  tapestry  and,  from  the  William 
Randolph  Hearst  estate,  a  gloomy  pair  of  Gothic  "easy"  chairs;  she  bought  the 
complete  Modern  Library,  shelves  of  classical  records,  innumerable.  Metropolitan 
Museum reproductions (including a statue of a Chinese cat that her own cat hated and 
hissed at and ultimately broke), a Waring mixer and a pressure cooker and a library of 
cook books.  She  spent  whole  hausfrau  afternoons  slopping  about in  the  sweatbox  of 
her  midget  kitchen:  "José  says  I'm  better  than  the  Colony.  Really,  who  would  have 
dreamed I had such a great natural talent? A month ago I couldn't scramble eggs." And 
still  couldn't,  for  that  matter.  Simple  dishes,  steak,  a  proper  salad,  were  beyond  her. 
Instead,  she  fed  José,  and  occasionally  myself,  outré  soups  (brandied  black  terrapin 

 

19

poured  into  avocado  shells)  Nero-ish  novelties  (roasted  pheasant  stuffed  with 
pomegranates  and  persimmons)  and  other  dubious  innovations  (chicken  and  saffron 
rice served with a chocolate sauce: "An East Indian classic, my dear.") Wartime sugar 
and cream rationing restricted her imagination when it came to sweets -- nevertheless, 
she once managed something called Tobacco Tapioca: best not describe it. 

Nor describe her attempts to master Portuguese, an ordeal as tedious to me as it 
was to her, for whenever I visited her an album of Linguaphone records never ceased 
rotating on the phonograph. Now, too, she rarely spoke a sentence that did not begin, 
"After we're married -- " or "When we move to Rio -- " Yet José had never suggested 
marriage. She admitted it. "But, after all, he knows I'm preggers. Well, I am, darling. Six 
weeks gone. I don't see why that should surprise you. It didn't me. Not un peu bit. I'm 
delighted. I want to have at least nine. I'm sure some of them will be rather dark -- José 
has a touch of le nègre, I suppose you guessed that? Which is fine by me: what could 
be  prettier  than  a  quite  coony  baby  with  bright  green  beautiful  eyes?  I  wish,  please 
don't  laugh  --  but  I  wish  I'd  been  a  virgin  for  him,  for  José.  Not  that  I've  warmed  the 
multitudes some people say: I don't blame the bastards for saying it, I've always thrown 
out such a jazzy line. Really, though, I toted up the other night, and I've only had eleven 
lovers -- not counting anything that happened before I was thirteen because, after all, 
that just doesn't count. Eleven. Does that make me a whore? Look at Mag Wildwood. 
Or  Honey  Tucker. Or  Rose  Ellen  Ward.  They've  had  the  old  clap-yo'-hands so  many 
times it amounts to applause. Of course I haven't anything against whores. Except this: 
some of them may have an honest tongue but they all have dishonest hearts. I mean, 
you can't bang the guy and cash his checks and at least not try to believe you love him. 
I never have. Even Benny Shacklett and all those rodents. I sort of hypnotized myself 
into thinking their sheer rattiness had a certain allure. Actually, except for Doc, if you 
want  to  count  Doc,  José  is  my  first  non-rat  romance.  Oh,  he's  not  my  idea  of  the 
absolute finito. He tells little lies and he worries what people think and he takes about 
fifty baths a day: men ought to smell somewhat. He's too prim, too cautious to be my 
guy  ideal;  he  always  turns  his  back  to  get  undressed  and  he  makes  too  much  noise 
when he eats and I don't like to see him run because there's something funny-looking 
about him when he runs. If I were free to choose from everybody alive, just snap my 
fingers  and  say  come  here  you,  I  wouldn't  pick  José.  Nehru,  he's  nearer  the  mark. 
Wendell  Wilkie.  I'd  settle  for Garbo  any  day.  Why  not?  A  person  ought  to  be  able  to 
marry men or women or -- listen, if you came to me and said you wanted to hitch up 
with Man o' War, I'd respect your feeling. No, I'm serious. Love should be allowed. I'm 
all for it. Now that I've got a pretty good idea what it is. Because I do love José -- I'd 
stop smoking if he asked me to. He's friendly, he can laugh me out of the mean reds, 
only I don't have them much any more, except sometimes, and even then they're not so 
hideola  that  I  gulp  Seconal  or  have  to  haul  myself  to  Tiffany's:  I  take  his  suit  to  the 
cleaner, or stuff some mushrooms, and I feel fine, just great. Another thing, I've thrown 

away  my  horoscopes.  I  must  have  spent  a  dollar  on  every  goddamn  star  in  the 
goddamn planetarium. It's a bore, but the answer, is good things only happen to you if 
you're  good.  Good?  Honest  is  more  what  I  mean.  Not  law-type  honest  --  I'd  rob  a 
grave,  I'd  steal  two-bits  off  a  dead  man's  eyes  if  I  thought  it  would  contribute  to  the 
day's enjoyment -- but unto-thyself-type honest. Be anything but a coward, a pretender, 
an emotional crook, a whore: I'd rather have cancer than a dishonest heart. Which isn't 
being pious. Just practical. Cancer may cool you, but the other's sure to. Oh, screw it, 
cookie -- hand me my guitar, and I'll sing you a fada in the most perfect Portuguese." 

Those final weeks, spanning end of summer and the beginning of another autumn, 
are blurred in memory, perhaps because our understanding of each other had reached 
that sweet depth where two people communicate more often in silence than in words: 
an  affectionate  quietness  replaces  the  tensions,  the  unrelaxed  chatter  and  chasing 
about  that  produce  a  friendship's  more  showy,  more,  in  the  surface  sense,  dramatic 
moments. Frequently, when he was out of town (I'd developed hostile attitudes toward 
him,  and seldom  used his  name)  we  spent entire  evenings  together  during  which  we 
exchanged less than a hundred words; once, we walked all the way to Chinatown, ate 
a chow-mein supper, bought some paper lanterns and stole a box of joss sticks, then 
moseyed  across  the  Brooklyn  Bridge,  and  on  the  bridge,  as  we  watched  seaward-
moving  ships  pass  between  the  cliffs  of  burning  skyline,  she  said:  "Years  from  now, 
years and years, one of those ships will bring me back, me and my nine Brazilian brats. 
Because yes, they must see this, these lights, the river -- I love New York, even though 
it  isn't  mine,  the  way  something  has  to  be,  a  tree  or  a street  or  a  house,  something, 
anyway, that belongs to me because I belong to it." And I said: "Do shut up," for I felt 
infuriatingly  left  out  --  a  tugboat  in  drydock  while  she,  glittery  voyager  of  secure 
destination, steamed down the harbor with whistles whistling and confetti in the air. So 
the days, the last days, blow about in memory, hazy, autumnal, all alike as leaves: until 
a day unlike any other I've lived. 

 
It happened to fall on the 30th of September, my birthday, a fact which had no effect 
on events, except that, expecting some form of monetary remembrance from my family, 
I was eager for the postman's morning visit. Indeed, I went downstairs and waited for 
him. If I had not been loitering in the vestibule, then Holly would not have asked me to 
go horseback riding; and would not, consequently, have had the opportunity to save my 
life. 

"Come  on,"  she  said,  when  she  found  me  awaiting  the  postman.  "Let's  walk  a 
couple of horses around the park." She was wearing a windbreaker and a pair of blue 
jeans  and  tennis  shoes;  she  slapped  her  stomach,  drawing  attention  to  its  flatness: 
"Don't think I'm out to lose the heir. But there's a horse, my darling old Mabel Minerva -- 
I can't go without saying good-bye to Mabel Minerva." 

"Good-bye?" 

 

20

"A week from Saturday. José bought the tickets." In rather a trance, I let her lead 
me  down  to  the  street.  "We  change  planes  in  Miami.  Then  over  the  sea.  Over  the 
Andes. Taxi!" 

Over  the  Andes.  As  we  rode  in  a  cab  across  Central  Park  it  seemed  to  me  as 

though I, too, were flying, desolately floating over snow-peaked and perilous territory. 

"But you can't. After all, what about. Well, what about. Well, you can't really run off 

and leave everybody." 

"I don't think anyone will miss me. I have no friends." 
"I will. Miss you. So will Joe Bell. And oh -- millions. Like Sally. Poor Mr. Tomato." 
"I loved old Sally," she said, and sighed. "You know I haven't been to see him in a 
month? When I told him I was going away, he was an angel. Actually" -- she frowned -- 
"he  seemed  delighted  that  I  was  leaving  the  country.  He  said  it  was  all  for  the  best. 
Because sooner or later there might be trouble. If they found out I wasn't his real niece. 
That fat lawyer, O'Shaughnessy, O'Shaughnessy sent me five hundred dollars. In cash. 
A wedding present from Sally." 

I wanted to be unkind. "You can expect a present from me, too. When, and if, the 

wedding happens." 

She laughed. "He'll marry me, all right. In church. And with his family there. That's 

why we're waiting till we get to Rio." 

"Does he know you're married already?" 
"What's  the  matter  with  you?  Are  you  trying  to  ruin  the  day?  It's  a  beautiful  day: 

leave it alone!" 

"But it's perfectly possible -- " 
"It  isn't  possible.  I've  told  you,  that  wasn't  legal.  It  couldn't  be."  She  rubbed  her 
nose, and glanced at me sideways. "Mention that to a living soul, darling. I'll hang you 
by your toes and dress you for a hog." 

The  stables  --  I  believe  they have  been  replaced  by  television  studios  --  were  on 
West Sixty-sixth street Holly selected for me an old sway-back black and white mare: 
"Don't  worry,  she's  safer  than  a  cradle."  Which,  in  my  case,  was  a  necessary 
guarantee,  for  ten-cent  pony  rides  at  childhood  carnivals  were  the  limit  of  my 
equestrian  experience.  Holly helped  hoist me  into  the  saddle,  then mounted  her  own 
horse, a silvery animal that took the lead as we jogged across the traffic of Central Park 
West and entered a riding path dappled with leaves denuding breezes danced about. 

"See?"  she  shouted.  "It's  great!"  And  suddenly  it  was.  Suddenly,  watching  the 
tangled  colors  of  Holly's  hair  flash  in  the  red-yellow  leaf  light,  I  loved  her  enough  to 
forget  myself,  my  self-pitying  despairs,  and  be  content  that  something  she  thought 
happy  was  going  to  happen.  Very  gently  the  horses  began  to  trot,  waves  of  wind 
splashed us, spanked our faces, we plunged in and out of sun and shadow pools, and 
joy, a glad-to-be-alive exhilaration, jolted through me like a jigger of nitrogen. That was 
one minute; the next introduced farce in grim disguise. 

For all at once, like savage members of a jungle ambush, a band of Negro boys 

leapt  out of  the shrubbery  along  the  path.  Hooting,  cursing,  they  launched  rocks  and 
thrashed at the horse's rumps with switches. 

Mine,  the  black  and  white  mare,  rose  on  her  hind  legs,  whinnied,  teetered  like  a 
tightrope artist, then blue-streaked down the path, bouncing my feet out of the stirrups 
and leaving me scarcely attached. Her hooves made the gravel stones spit sparks. The 
sky  careened.  Trees,  a  lake  with  little-boy  sailboats,  statues  went  by  licketysplit. 
Nursemaids rushed to rescue their charges from our awesome approach; men, bums 
and others, yelled: "Pull in the reins!" and "Whoa, boy, whoa!" and "Jump!" It was only 
later that I remembered these voices; at the time I was simply conscious of Holly, the 
cowboy-sound  of  her  racing  behind  me,  never  quite  catching  up,  and  over  and  over 
calling  encouragements.  Onward:  across  the  park  and  out  into  Fifth  Avenue: 
stampeding  against  the  noonday  traffic,  taxis,  buses  that  screechingly  swerved.  Past 
the Duke mansion, the Frick Museum, past the Pierre and the Plaza. But Holly gained 
ground;  moreover,  a  mounted  policeman  had  joined  the  chase:  flanking  my  runaway 
mare, one on either side, their horses performed a pincer movement that brought her to 
a steamy halt. It was then, at last, that I fell off her back. Fell off and picked myself up 
and stood there, not altogether certain where I was. A crowd gathered. The policeman 
huffed and wrote in a book: presently he was most sympathetic, grinned and said he 
would arrange for our horses to be returned to their stable. 

Holly put us in a taxi. "Darling. How do you feel?" 
"Fine." 
"But you haven't any pulse," she said, feeling my wrist. 
"Then I must be dead." 
"No, idiot. This is serious. Look at me." 
The  trouble  was,  I  couldn't  see  her;  rather,  I  saw  several  Holly's,  a  trio  of  sweaty 
faces  so  white  with  concern  that  I  was  both  touched  and  embarrassed.  "Honestly.  I 
don't feel anything. Except ashamed." 

"Please. Are you sure? Tell me the truth. You might have been killed." 
"But  I  wasn't.  And  thank  you.  For saving my  life.  You're  wonderful.  Unique.  I  love 

you." 

"Damn fool." She kissed me on the cheek. Then there were four of her, and I fainted 

dead away. 

 
That  evening,  photographs  of  Holly  were  frontpaged  by  the  late  edition  of  the 
Journal-American and by the early editions of both the Daily News and the Daily Mirror. 
The publicity had nothing to do with runaway horses. It concerned quite another matter, 
as  the  headlines  revealed:  PLAYGIRL  ARRESTED  IN  NARCOTICS  SCANDAL 
(Journal-American),  ARREST  DOPE-SMUGGLING  ACTRESS  (Daily  News),  DRUG 
RING EXPOSED, GLAMOUR GIRL HELD (Daily Mirror). 

 

21

Of  the  lot,  the  News  printed  the  most  striking  picture:  Holly,  entering  police 
headquarters, wedged between two muscular detectives, one male, one female. In this 
squalid context even her clothes (she was still wearing her riding costume, windbreaker 
and  blue  jeans)  suggested  a  gang-moll  hooligan:  an  impression  dark  glasses, 
disarrayed coiffure and a Picayune cigarette dangling from sullen lips did not diminish. 
The  caption  read:  Twenty-year-old  Holly  Golightly,  beautiful  movie  starlet  and  cafe 
society  celebrity  D.A.  alleges  to  be  key  figure  in  international  drug-smuggling  racket 
linked  to  racketeer  Salvatore  "Sally"  Tomato.  Dets.  Patrick  Connor  and  Sheilah 
Fezzonetti (L. and R.) are shown escorting her into 67th St. Precinct. See story on Pg. 
3.  The  story,  featuring  a  photograph  of  a  man  identified  as  Oliver  "Father" 
O'Shaughnessy  (shielding  his  face  with  a  fedora),  ran  three  full  columns.  Here, 
somewhat  condensed,  are  the  pertinent  paragraphs:  Members  of  café  society  were 
stunned  today  by  the  arrest  of  gorgeous  Holly  Golightly,  twenty-year-old  Hollywood 
starlet  and  highly  publicized  girl-about-New  York.  At  the  same  time,  2  P.M.,  police 
nabbed Oliver O'Shaughnessy, 52, of the Hotel Seabord, W. 49th St., as he exited from 
a  Hamburg  Heaven  on  Madison  Ave.  Both  are  alleged  by  District  Attorney  Frank  L. 
Donovan  to  be  important  figures  in  an  international  drug  ring  dominated  by  the 
notorious Mafia-führer Salvatore "Sally" Tomato, currently in Sing Sing serving a five-
year rap for political bribery ... O'Shaughnessy, a defrocked priest variously known in 
crimeland circles as "Father" and "The Padre," has a history of arrests dating back to 
1934, when he served two years for operating a phony Rhode Island mental institution, 
The Monastery. Miss Golightly, who has no previous criminal record, was arrested in 
her luxurious apartment at a swank East Side address ... Although the D.A.'s office has 
issued no formal statement, responsible sources insist the blond and beautiful actress, 
not long ago the constant companion of multimillionaire Rutherfurd Trawler, has been 
acting  as  "liaison"  between 
imprisoned  Tomato  and  his  chief-lieutenant, 
O'Shaughnessy ... Posing as a relative of Tomato's, Miss Golightly is said to have paid 
weekly visits to Sing Sing, and on these occasions Tomato supplied her with verbally 
coded messages which she then transmitted to O'Shaughnessy. Via this link, Tomato, 
believed to have been born in Cefalu, Sicily, in 1874, was able to keep firsthand control 
of  a  world-wide  narcotics  syndicate  with  outposts  in  Mexico,  Cuba,  Sicily,  Tangier, 
Tehran and Dakar. But the D.A.'s office refused to offer any detail on these allegations 
or even verify them ... Tipped off, a large number of reporters were on hand at the E. 
67th St. Precinct station when the accused pair arrived for booking. O'Shaughnessy, a 
burly red-haired man, refused comment and kicked one cameraman in the groin. But 
Miss Golightly, a fragile eyeful, even though attired like a tomboy in slacks and leather 
jacket, appeared relatively unconcerned. "Don't ask me what the hell this is about," she 
told  reporters.  "Parce-que  Je  ne  sais  pas,  mes  chères.  (Because  I  do  not  know,  my 
dears). Yes -- I have visited Sally Tomato. I used to go to see him every week. What's 
wrong with that? He believes in God, and so do I." ...  

the 

Then, under the subheading ADMITS OWN DRUG ADDICTION: Miss Golightly 

smiled when a reporter asked whether or not she herself is a narcotics user. "I've had a 
little go at marijuana. It's not half so destructive as brandy. Cheaper, too. Unfortunately, 
I prefer brandy. No, Mr. Tomato never mentioned drugs to me. It makes me furious, the 
way these wretched people keep persecuting him. He's a sensitive, a religious person. 
A darling old man." 

There  is  one  especially  gross  error  in  this  report:  she  was  not  arrested  in  her 
"luxurious apartment." It took place in my own bathroom. I was soaking away my horse-
ride pains in a tub of scalding water laced with Epsom salts; Holly, an attentive nurse, 
was sitting on the edge of the tub waiting to rub me with Sloan's liniment and tuck me 
into bed. There was a knock at the front door. As the door was unlocked, Holly called 
Come  in.  In  came  Madame  Sapphia  Spanella,  trailed  by  a  pair  of  civilian-clothed 
detectives, one of them a lady with thick yellow braids roped round her head. 

"Here  she  is:  the  wanted  woman!"  boomed  Madame  Spanella,  invading  the 
bathroom  and  leveling  a  finger,  first  at  Holly's,  then  my  nakedness.  "Look.  What  a 
whore she is." The male detective seemed embarrassed: by Madame Spanella and by 
the situation; but a harsh enjoyment tensed the face of his companion -- she plumped a 
hand  on  Holly's  shoulder  and,  in  a  surprising  baby-child  voice,  said:  "Come  along, 
sister. You're going places." Whereupon Holly coolly told her: "Get them cotton-pickin' 
hands  off  of  me,  you  dreary,  driveling  old  bull-dyke."  Which  rather  enraged  the  lady: 
she slapped Holly damned hard. So hard, her head twisted on her neck, and the bottle 
of linement, flung from her hand, smithereened on the tile floor -- where I, scampering 
out of the tub to enrich the fray, stepped on it and all but severed both big toes. Nude 
and bleeding a path of bloody footprints, I followed the action as far as the hall. "Don't 
forget," Holly managed to instruct me as the detectives propelled her down the stairs, 
"please feed the cat." 

 
Of  course  I  believed  Madame  Spanella  to  blame:  she'd  several  times  called  the 
authorities  to  complain  about  Holly.  It  didn't  occur  to  me  the  affair  could  have  dire 
dimensions until that evening when Joe Bell showed up flourishing the newspapers. He 
was too agitated to speak sensibly; he caroused the room hitting his fists together while 
I read the accounts. 

Then he said: "You think it's so? She was mixed up in this lousy business?" 
"Well, yes." 
He popped a Tums in his mouth and, glaring at me, chewed it as though he were 
crunching  my  bones.  "Boy,  that's  rotten.  And  you  meant  to  be  her  friend.  What  a 
bastard!" 

"Just a minute. I didn't say she was involved knowingly. She wasn't. But there, she 

did do it. Carry messages and whatnot -- " 

He said: "Take it pretty calm, don't you? Jesus, she could get ten years. More." He 

 

22

yanked  the  papers  away  from  me.  "You  know  her  friends.  These  rich  fellows.  Come 
down to the bar, we'll start phoning. Our girl's going to need fancier shysters than I can 
afford." 

I was too sore and shaky to dress myself; Joe Bell had to help. Back at his bar he 
propped  me  in  the  telephone  booth  with  a  triple  martini  and  a  brandy  tumbler  full  of 
coins. But I couldn't think who to contact. José was in Washington, and I had no notion 
where to reach him there. Rusty Trawler? Not that bastard! Only: what other friends of 
hers did I know? Perhaps she'd been right when she'd said she had none, not really. 

I put through a call to Crestview 5-6958 in Beverly Hills, the number long-distance 
information gave me for O.J. Berman. The person who answered said Mr. Berman was 
having a massage and couldn't be disturbed: sorry, try later. Joe Bell was incensed -- 
told me I should have said it was a life and death matter; and he insisted on my trying 
Rusty.  First,  I  spoke  to  Mr.  Trawler's  butler  --  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Trawler,  he  announced, 
were at dinner and might he take a message? Joe Bell shouted into the receiver: "This 
is  urgent,  mister.  Life  and  death."  The  outcome  was  that  I  found  myself  talking  -- 
listening,  rather  --  to  the  former  Mag  Wildwood:  "Are  you  starkers?"  she  demanded. 
"My husband and I will positively sue anyone who attempts to connect our names with 
that ro-ro-rovolting and de-de-degenerate girl. I always knew she was a hop-hop-head 
with no more morals than a hound-bitch in heat. Prison is where she belongs. And my 
husband agrees one thousand percent. We will positively sue anyone who -- " Hanging 
up, I remembered old Doc down in Tulip, Texas; but no, Holly wouldn't like it if I called 
him, she'd kill me good. 

I  rang  California  again;  the  circuits  were  busy,  stayed  busy,  and  by  the  time  O.J. 
Berman  was  on  the  line  I'd  emptied  so  many  martinis  he  had  to  tell  me  why  I  was 
phoning  him:  "About  the  kid,  is  it?  I  know  already.  I  spoke  already  to  Iggy  Fitelstein. 
Iggy's the best shingle in New York. I said Iggy you take care of it, send me the bill, 
only keep my name anonymous, see. Well, I owe the kid something. Not that I owe her 
anything,  you  want  to  come  down  to  it.  She's  crazy.  A  phony.  But  a  real  phony,  you 
know?  Anyway,  they  only  got  her  in  ten  thousand  bail.  Don't  worry,  Iggy'll  spring  her 
tonight -- it wouldn't surprise me she's home already." 

 
But she wasn't; nor had she returned the next morning when I went down to feed 
her cat. Having no key to the apartment, I used the fire escape and gained entrance 
through  a  window.  The  cat  was  in  the  bedroom,  and  he  was  not  alone:  a  man  was 
there,  crouching  over  a  suitcase.  The  two  of  us,  each  thinking  the  other  a  burglar, 
exchanged  uncomfortable  stares  as  I  stepped  through  the  window.  He  had  a  pretty 
face,  lacquered  hair,  he  resembled  José;  moreover,  the  suitcase  he'd  been  packing 
contained the wardrobe José kept at Holly's, the shoes and suits she fussed over, was 
always carting to menders and cleaners. And I said, certain it was so: "Did Mr. Ybarra-
Jaegar send you?" 

"I am the cousin," he said with a wary grin and just-penetrable accent. 
"Where is José?" 
He  repeated  the  question,  as  though  translating  it  into  another  language.  "Ah, 
where she is! She is wailing," he said and, seeming to dismiss me, resumed his valet 
activities. 

So: the diplomat was planning a powder. Well, I wasn't amazed; or in the slightest 

sorry. Still, what a heartbreaking stunt: "He ought to be horse-whipped." 

The cousin giggled, I'm sure he understood me. He shut the suitcase and produced 

a letter. "My cousin, she ask me leave that for his chum. You will oblige?" 

On the envelope was scribbled: For Miss H. Golightly -- Courtesy Bearer. 
I sat down on Holly's bed, and hugged Holly's cat to me, and felt as badly for Holly, 

every iota, as she could feel for herself. 

"Yes, I will oblige." 
 
And I did: without the least wanting to. But I hadn't the courage to destroy the letter; 
or the will power to keep it in my pocket when Holly very tentatively inquired if, if by any 
chance, I'd had news of José. It was two mornings later; I was sitting by her bedside in 
a room that reeked of iodine and bedpans, a hospital room. She had been there since 
the  night  of  her  arrest.  "Well,  darling,"  she'd  greeted  me,  as  I  tiptoed  toward  her 
carrying a carton of Picayune cigarettes and a wheel of new-autumn violets, "I lost the 
heir." She looked not quite twelve years: her pale vanilla hair brushed back, her eyes, 
for  once  minus  their  dark  glasses,  clear  as  rain  water  --  one  couldn't  believe  how  ill 
she'd been. 

Yet it was true: "Christ, I nearly cooled. No fooling, the fat woman almost had me. 
She  was  yakking  up  a  storm.  I  guess  I  couldn't  have  told  you  about  the  fat  woman. 
Since I didn't know about her myself until my brother died. Right away I was wondering 
where he'd gone, what it meant, Fred's dying; and then I saw her, she was there in the 
room with me, and she had Fred cradled in her arms, a fat mean red bitch rocking in a 
rocking chair with Fred on her lap and laughing like a brass band. The mockery of it! 
But it's all that's ahead for us, my friend: this comedienne waiting to give you the old 
razz. Now do you see why I went crazy and broke everything?" 

Except for the lawyer O.J. Berman had hired, I was the only visitor she had been 
allowed.  Her  room  was  shared  by  other  patients,  a  trio  of  triplet-like  ladies  who, 
examining  me  with  an  interest  not  unkind  but  total,  speculated  in  whispered  Italian. 
Holly explained that: "They think you're my downfall, darling. The fellow what done me 
wrong";  and,  to  a  suggestion  that  she  set  them  straight,  replied:  "I  can't.  They  don't 
speak  English.  Anyway,  I  wouldn't  dream  of  spoiling  their  fun."  It  was  then  that  she 
asked about José. 

The instant she saw the letter she squinted her eyes and bent her lips in a tough 
tiny  smile  that  advanced  her  age  immeasurably.  "Darling,"  she  instructed  me,  "would 

 

23

you  reach  in  the  drawer  there  and  give me  my  purse.  A  girl  doesn't  read  this  sort  of 
thing without her lipstick." 

Guided by a compact mirror, she powdered, painted every vestige of twelve-year-
old  out  of  her  face.  She  shaped  her  lips  with  one  tube,  colored  her  cheeks  from 
another.  She  penciled  the  rims  of  her  eyes,  blued  the  lids,  sprinkled  her  neck  with 
4711;  attached  pearls  to  her  ears  and  donned  her  dark  glasses;  thus  armored,  and 
after  a  displeased  appraisal  of  her manicure's  shabby  condition,  she  ripped open  the 
letter  and  let  her  eyes  race  through  it  while  her  stony  small  smile  grew  smaller  and 
harder.  Eventually  she  asked  for  a  Picayune.  Took  a  puff:  "Tastes  bum.  But  divine," 
she said and, tossing me the letter: "Maybe this will come in handy -- if you ever write a 
rat-romance. Don't be hoggy: read it aloud. I'd like to hear it myself." 

It began: "My dearest little girl -- " 
Holly at once interrupted. She wanted to know what I thought of the handwriting. I 
thought nothing: a tight, highly legible, uneccentric script. "It's him to a T. Buttoned up 
and constipated," she declared. "Go on." 

"My  dearest  little  girl,  I  have  loved  you  knowing  you  were  not  as  others.  But 
conceive  of  my  despair  upon  discovering  in  such  a  brutal  and  public  style  how  very 
different you are from the manner of woman a man of my faith and career could hope 
to make his wife. Verily I grief for the disgrace of your present circumstance, and do not 
find it in my heart to add my condemn to the condemn that surrounds you. So I hope 
you will find it in your heart not to condemn me. I have my family to protect, and my 
name, and I am a coward where those institutions enter. Forget me, beautiful child. I 
am no longer here. I am gone home. But may God always be with you and your child. 
May God be not the same as -- José." 

"Well?" 
"In a way it seems quite honest. And even touching." 
"Touching? That square-ball jazz!" 
"But after all, he says he's a coward; and from his point of view, you must see -- " 
Holly,  however,  did  not  want  to  admit  that  she  saw;  yet  her  face,  despite  its 
cosmetic disguise, confessed it. "All right, he's not a rat without reason. A super-sized, 
King Kong-type rat like Rusty. Benny Shacklett. But oh gee, golly goddamn," she said, 
jamming a fist into her mouth like a bawling baby, "I did love him. The rat." 

The Italian trio imagined a lover's crise and, placing the blame for Holly's groanings 
where  they  felt  it  belonged,  tut-tutted  their  tongues  at  me.  I  was  flattered:  proud  that 
anyone  should  think  Holly  cared  for  me.  She  quieted  when  I  offered  her  another 
cigarette. She swallowed and said: "Bless you, Buster. And bless you for being such a 
bad jockey. If I hadn't had to play Calamity Jane I'd still be looking forward to the grub 
in  an  unwed  mama's  home.  Strenuous  exercise,  that's  what  did  the  trick.  But  I've 
scared  la  merde  out  of  the  whole  badge-department  by  saying  it  was  because  Miss 
Dykeroo slapped me. Yessir, I can sue them on several counts, including false arrest." 

Until then, we'd skirted mention of her more sinister tribulations, and this jesting 

reference to them seemed appalling, pathetic, so definitely did it reveal how incapable 
she was of recognizing the bleak realities before her. "Now, Holly," I said, thinking: be 
strong,  mature,  an  uncle.  "Now,  Holly.  We  can't  treat  it  as  a  joke.  We  have  to  make 
plans." 

"You're too young to be stuffy. Too small. By the way, what business is it of yours?" 
"None. Except you're my friend, and I'm worried. I mean to know what you intend 

doing." 

She rubbed her nose, and concentrated on the ceiling. "Today's Wednesday, isn't 
it? So I suppose I'll sleep until Saturday, really get a good schluffen. Saturday morning 
I'll skip out to the bank. Then I'll stop by the apartment and pick up a nightgown or two 
and my Mainbocher. Following which, I'll report to Idlewild. Where, as you damn well 
know,  I  have  a  perfectly  fine  reservation  on  a  perfectly  fine  plane.  And  since  you're 
such a friend I'll let you wave me off. Please stop shaking your head." 

"Holly. Holly. You can't do that." 
"Et  pourquoi  pas?  I'm  not  hot-footing  after  José,  if  that's  what  you  suppose. 
According  to  my  census,  he's  strictly  a  citizen  of  Limboville.  It's  only:  why  should  I 
waste a perfectly fine ticket? Already paid for? Besides, I've never been to Brazil." 

"Just what kind of pills have they been feeding you here? Can't you realize, you're 
under a criminal indictment. If they catch you jumping bail, they'll throw away the key. 
Even if you get away with it, you'll never be able to come home." 

"Well, so, tough titty. Anyway, home is where you feel at home. I'm still looking." 
"No, Holly, it's stupid. You're innocent. You've got to stick it out." 
She  said,  "Rah,  team,  rah,"  and  blew  smoke  in  my  face.  She  was  impressed, 
however;  her  eyes  were  dilated  by  unhappy  visions,  as  were  mine:  iron  rooms,  steel 
corridors  of  gradually  closing  doors.  "Oh,  screw  it,"  she  said,  and  stabbed  out  her 
cigarette. "I have a fair chance they won't catch me. Provided you keep your bouche 
fermez. Look. Don't despise me, darling." She put her hand over mine and pressed it 
with sudden immense sincerity. "I haven't much choice. I talked it over with the lawyer: 
oh, I didn't tell him anything regarding Rio -- he'd tip the badgers himself, rather than 
lose his  fee, to  say  nothing  of  the  nickels  O.J.  put  up for  bail.  Bless  O.J.'s  heart;  but 
once on the coast I helped him win more than ten thou in a single poker hand: we're 
square.  No,  here's  the  real  shake:  all  the  badgers  want  from  me  is  a  couple  of  free 
grabs and my services as a state's witness against Sally -- nobody has any intention of 
prosecuting  me,  they  haven't  a  ghost  of  a  case.  Well,  I  may  be  rotten  to  the  core, 
Maude,  but:  testify  against  a  friend  I  will  not.  Not  if  they  can  prove  he  doped  Sister 
Kenny.  My  yardstick  is  how  somebody  treats  me,  and  old  Sally,  all  right  he  wasn't 
absolutely white with me, say he took a slight advantage, just the same Sally's an okay 
shooter,  and  I'd  let  the  fat  woman  snatch  me  sooner  than  help  the  law-boys  pin  him 
down." Tilting her compact mirror above her face, smoothing her lipstick with a crooked 

 

24

pinkie,  she  said:  "And to  be honest,  that  isn't all.  Certain shades  of limelight  wreck  a 
girl's complexion. Even if a jury gave me the Purple Heart, this neighborhood holds no 
future: they'd still have up every rope from LaRue to Perona's Bar and Grill -- take my 
word,  I'd  be  about  as  welcome  as  Mr.  Frank  E.  Campbell.  And  if  you  lived  off  my 
particular talents, Cookie, you'd understand the kind of bankruptcy I'm describing. Uh, 
uh,  I  don't  just  fancy  a  fade-out  that  finds  me  belly-bumping  around  Roseland  with  a 
pack of West Side hillbillies. While the excellent Madame Trawler sashayes her twat in 
and out of Tiffany's. I couldn't take it. Give me the fat woman any day." 

A  nurse,  soft-shoeing  into  the  room,  advised  that  visiting  hours  were  over.  Holly 
started to complain, and was curtailed by having a thermometer popped in her mouth. 
But as I took leave, she unstoppered herself to say: "Do me a favor, darling. Call up the 
Times,  or  whatever  you  call,  and  get  a  list  of  the  fifty  richest  men  in  Brazil.  I'm  not 
kidding. The fifty richest: regardless of race or color. Another favor -- poke around my 
apartment till you find that medal you gave me. The St. Christopher. I'll need it for the 
trip." 
 
The  sky  was  red  Friday  night,  it  thundered,  and  Saturday,  departing  day,  the  city 
swayed in a squall-like downpour. Sharks might have swum through the air, though it 
seemed improbable a plane could penetrate it. 

But Holly, ignoring my cheerful conviction that her flight would not go, continued her 
preparations  --  placing,  I  must  say,  the  chief  burden  of  them  on  me.  For  she  had 
decided  it  would  be unwise  of  her  to  come  near  the brownstone. Quite  rightly,  too:  it 
was under surveillance, whether by police or reporters or other interested parties one 
couldn't  tell  --  simply  a  man,  sometimes  men,  who  hung  around  the  stoop.  So  she'd 
gone from the hospital to a bank and straight then to Joe Bell's Bar. "She don't figure 
she was followed," Joe Bell told me when he came with a message that Holly wanted 
me to meet her there as soon as possible, a half-hour at most, bringing: "Her jewelry. 
Her guitar. Toothbrushes and stuff. And a bottle of hundred-year-old brandy: she says 
you'll find it hid down in the bottom of the dirty-clothes basket. Yeah, oh, and the cat. 
She wants the cat. But hell," he said, "I don't know we should help her at all. She ought 
to be protected against herself. Me, I feel like telling the cops. Maybe if I go back and 
build her some drinks, maybe I can get her drunk enough to call it off." 

Stumbling,  skidding  up  and  down  the  fire  escape  between  Holly's  apartment  and 
mine, wind-blown and winded and wet to the bone (clawed to the bone as well, for the 
cat had not looked favorably upon evacuation, especially in such inclement weather) I 
managed a fast, first-rate job of assembling her going-away belongings. I even found 
the St. Christopher's medal. Everything was piled on the floor of my room, a poignant 
pyramid  of  brassières  and  dancing  slippers  and  pretty  things  I  packed  in  Holly's  only 
suitcase. There was a mass left over that I had to put in paper grocery bags. I couldn't 
think how to carry the cat; until I thought of stuffing him in a pillowcase. 

Never  mind  why,  but  once  I  walked  from  New  Orleans  to  Nancy's  Landing, 

Mississippi, just under five hundred miles. It was a light-hearted lark compared to the 
journey to Joe Bell's bar. The guitar filled with rain, rain softened the paper sacks, the 
sacks spilt and perfume spilled on the pavement, pearls rolled in the gutter: while the 
wind pushed and the cat scratched, the cat screamed -- but worse, I was frightened, a 
coward to equal José: those storming streets seemed aswarm with unseen presences 
waiting to trap, imprison me for aiding an outlaw. 

The outlaw said: "You're late, Buster. Did you bring the brandy?" 
And  the  cat,  released,  leaped  and  perched  on  her  shoulder:  his  tail  swung  like  a 
baton  conducting  rhapsodic  music.  Holly,  too,  seemed  inhabited  by  melody,  some 
bouncy bon voyage oompahpah. Uncorking the brandy, she said: "This was meant to 
be part of my hope chest. The idea was, every anniversary we'd have a swig. Thank 
Jesus I never bought the chest. Mr. Bell, sir, three glasses." 

"You'll only need two," he told her. "I won't drink to your foolishness." 
The more she cajoled him ("Ah, Mr. Bell. The lady doesn't vanish every day. Won't 
you toast her?"), the gruffer he was: "I'll have no part of it. If you're going to hell, you'll 
go  on  your  own.  With  no  further  help  from  me."  An  inaccurate  statement:  because 
seconds after he'd made it a chauffeured limousine drew up outside the bar, and Holly, 
the  first  to  notice  it,  put  down  her  brandy,  arched  her  eyebrows,  as  though  she 
expected to see the District Attorney himself alight. So did I. And when I saw Joe Bell 
blush,  I  had  to  think:  by  God,  he  did  call  the  police.  But  then,  with  burning  ears,  he 
announced:  "It's  nothing.  One  of  them  Carey  Cadillacs.  I  hired  it.  To  take  you  to  the 
airport." 

He turned his back on us to fiddle with one of his flower arrangements. Holly said: 

"Kind, dear Mr. Bell. Look at me, sir." 

 
He wouldn't. He wrenched the flowers from the vase and thrust them at her; they 
missed their mark, scattered on the floor. "Good-bye," he said; and, as though he were 
going to vomit, scurried to the men's room. We heard the door lock. 

The Carey chauffeur was a worldy specimen who accepted our slapdash luggage 
most civilly and remained rock-faced when, as the limousine swished uptown through a 
lessening  rain,  Holly  stripped  off  her  clothes,  the  riding  costume  she'd  never  had  a 
chance  to  substitute,  and  struggled  into  a  slim  black  dress.  We  didn't  talk:  talk  could 
have only led to argument; and also, Holly seemed too preoccupied for conversation. 
She hummed to herself, swigged brandy, she leaned constantly forward to peer out the 
windows, as if she were hunting an address -- or, I decided, taking a last impression of 
a  scene  she  wanted  to  remember.  It  was  neither  of  these.  But  this:  "Stop  here,"  she 
ordered the driver, and we pulled to the curb of a street in Spanish Harlem. A savage, a 
garish,  a  moody  neighborhood  garlanded  with  poster-portraits  of  movie  stars  and 
Madonnas. Sidewalk litterings of fruit-rind and rotted newspaper were hurled about by 

 

25

heart  attack at  Sing  Sing.  Months  went  by, a  winter  of  them,  and not  a  word  from 
Holly. The owner of the brownstone sold her abandoned possessions, the white-satin 
bed, the tapestry, her precious Gothic chair; a new tenant acquired the apartment, his 
name was Quaintance Smith, and he entertained as many gentlemen callers of a noisy 
nature  as  Holly  ever  had  --  though  in  this  instance  Madame  Spanella  did  not  object, 
indeed she doted on the young man and supplied filet mignon whenever he had a black 
eye.  But  in  the  spring  a  postcard  came:  it  was scribbled in  pencil,  and  signed  with  a 
lipstick kiss: Brazil was beastly but Buenos Aires the best. Not Tiffany's, but almost. Am 
joined  at  the  hip  with  duhvine  $enor.  Love?  Think  so.  Anyhoo  am  looking  for 
somewhere to live ($enor has wife, 7 brats) and will let you know address when I know 
it  myself.  Mille  tendresse.  But  the  address,  if  it  ever  existed,  never  was  sent,  which 
made me sad, there was so much I wanted to write her: that I'd sold two stories, had 
read  where  the  Trawlers  were  countersuing  for  divorce,  was  moving  out  of  the 
brownstone  because  it  was  haunted.  But  mostly,  I  wanted to  tell  her  about  her  cat.  I 
had  kept  my  promise;  I  had  found  him.  It  took  weeks  of  after-work  roaming  through 
those  Spanish  Harlem  streets,  and  there  were  many  false  alarms  --  flashes  of  tiger-
striped fur that, upon inspection, were not him. But one day, one cold sunshiny Sunday 
winter afternoon, it was. Flanked by potted plants and framed by clean lace curtains, he 
was seated in the window of a warm-looking room: I wondered what his name was, for I 
was certain he had one now, certain he'd arrived somewhere he belonged. African hut 
or whatever, I hope Holly has, too. 

 
 
 

the wind, for the wind still boomed, though the rain had hushed and there were bursts 
of blue in the sky. 

Holly stepped out of the car; she took the cat with her. Cradling him, she scratched 
his head and asked. "What do you think? This ought to be the right kind of place for a 
tough  guy  like  you.  Garbage  cans.  Rats  galore.  Plenty  of  cat-bums  to  gang  around 
with.  So  scram,"  she  said,  dropping  him;  and  when  he  did  not  move  away,  instead 
raised  his  thug-face  and  questioned  her  with  yellowish  pirate-eyes,  she  stamped  her 
foot:  "I  said  beat  it!"  He  rubbed  against  her  leg.  "I  said  fuck  off!"  she  shouted,  then 
jumped back in the car, slammed the door, and: "Go," she told the driver. "Go. Go." 

I was stunned. "Well, you are. You are a bitch." 
We'd traveled a block before she replied. "I told you. We just met by the river one 
day: that's all. Independents, both of us. We never made each other any promises. We 
never -- " she said, and her voice collapsed, a tic, an invalid whiteness seized her face. 
The car had paused for a traffic light. Then she had the door open, she was running 
down the street; and I ran after her. 

But the cat was not at the corner where he'd been left. There was no one, nothing 
on  the  street  except  a  urinating  drunk  and  two  Negro  nuns  herding  a  file  of  sweet-
singing  children. Other children  emerged  from  doorways  and  ladies  leaned  over  their 
window  sills  to  watch  as  Holly  darted  up  and  down  the  block,  ran  back  and  forth 
chanting: "You. Cat. Where are you? Here, cat." She kept it up until a bumpy-skinned 
boy came forward dangling an old tom by the scruff of its neck: "You wants a nice kitty, 
miss? Gimme a dollar." 

The limousine had followed us. Now Holly let me steer her toward it. At the door, 
she hesitated; she looked past me, past the boy still offering his cat ("Haifa dollar. Two-
bits, maybe? Two-bits, it ain't much"), and she shuddered, she had to grip my arm to 
stand up: "Oh, Jesus God. We did belong to each other. He was mine." 

Then I made her a promise, I said I'd come back and find her cat: "I'll take care of 

him, too. I promise." 

She  smiled:  that  cheerless  new  pinch  of  a  smile.  "But  what  about  me?"  she  said, 
whispered, and shivered again. "I'm very scared, Buster. Yes, at last. Because it could 
go on forever. Not knowing what's yours until you've thrown it away. The mean reds, 
they're nothing. The fat woman, she nothing. This, though: my mouth's so dry, if my life
