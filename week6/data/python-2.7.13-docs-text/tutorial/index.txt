The Python Tutorial
*******************

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has
efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and
dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal
language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas
on most platforms.

The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely
available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the
Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely
distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers
to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and
additional documentation.

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data
types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C).
Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable
applications.

This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts
and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a
Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are
self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

For a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python
Standard Library. The Python Language Reference gives a more formal
definition of the language.  To write extensions in C or C++, read
Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API
Reference Manual. There are also several books covering Python in
depth.

This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every
single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it
introduces many of Python's most noteworthy features, and will give
you a good idea of the language's flavor and style. After reading it,
you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and
you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library
modules described in The Python Standard Library.
