Python/C API Reference Manual
*****************************

This manual documents the API used by C and C++ programmers who want
to write extension modules or embed Python.  It is a companion to
Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter, which describes the
general principles of extension writing but does not document the API
functions in detail.
