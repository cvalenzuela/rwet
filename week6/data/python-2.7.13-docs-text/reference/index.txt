The Python Language Reference
*****************************

This reference manual describes the syntax and "core semantics" of the
language. It is terse, but attempts to be exact and complete. The
semantics of non-essential built-in object types and of the built-in
functions and modules are described in The Python Standard Library.
For an informal introduction to the language, see The Python Tutorial.
For C or C++ programmers, two additional manuals exist: Extending and
Embedding the Python Interpreter describes the high-level picture of
how to write a Python extension module, and the Python/C API Reference
Manual describes the interfaces available to C/C++ programmers in
detail.
