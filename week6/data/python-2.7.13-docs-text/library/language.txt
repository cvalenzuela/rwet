Python Language Services
************************

Python provides a number of modules to assist in working with the
Python language.  These modules support tokenizing, parsing, syntax
analysis, bytecode disassembly, and various other facilities.

These modules include:

* "parser" --- Access Python parse trees

  * Creating ST Objects

  * Converting ST Objects

  * Queries on ST Objects

  * Exceptions and Error Handling

  * ST Objects

  * Example: Emulation of "compile()"

* "ast" --- Abstract Syntax Trees

  * Node classes

  * Abstract Grammar

  * "ast" Helpers

* "symtable" --- Access to the compiler's symbol tables

  * Generating Symbol Tables

  * Examining Symbol Tables

* "symbol" --- Constants used with Python parse trees

* "token" --- Constants used with Python parse trees

* "keyword" --- Testing for Python keywords

* "tokenize" --- Tokenizer for Python source

* "tabnanny" --- Detection of ambiguous indentation

* "pyclbr" --- Python class browser support

  * Class Objects

  * Function Objects

* "py_compile" --- Compile Python source files

* "compileall" --- Byte-compile Python libraries

  * Command-line use

  * Public functions

* "dis" --- Disassembler for Python bytecode

  * Python Bytecode Instructions

* "pickletools" --- Tools for pickle developers
