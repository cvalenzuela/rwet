Internet Protocols and Support
******************************

The modules described in this chapter implement Internet protocols and
support for related technology.  They are all implemented in Python.
Most of these modules require the presence of the system-dependent
module "socket", which is currently supported on most popular
platforms.  Here is an overview:
