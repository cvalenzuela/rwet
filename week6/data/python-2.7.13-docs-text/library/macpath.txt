"macpath" --- Mac OS 9 path manipulation functions
**************************************************

This module is the Mac OS 9 (and earlier) implementation of the
"os.path" module. It can be used to manipulate old-style Macintosh
pathnames on Mac OS X (or any other platform).

The following functions are available in this module: "normcase()",
"normpath()", "isabs()", "join()", "split()", "isdir()", "isfile()",
"walk()", "exists()". For other functions available in "os.path" dummy
counterparts are available.
