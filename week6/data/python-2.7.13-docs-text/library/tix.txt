"Tix" --- Extension widgets for Tk
**********************************

The "Tix" (Tk Interface Extension) module provides an additional rich
set of widgets. Although the standard Tk library has many useful
widgets, they are far from complete. The "Tix" library provides most
of the commonly needed widgets that are missing from standard Tk:
"HList", "ComboBox", "Control" (a.k.a. SpinBox) and an assortment of
scrollable widgets. "Tix" also includes many more widgets that are
generally useful in a wide range of applications: "NoteBook",
"FileEntry", "PanedWindow", etc; there are more than 40 of them.

With all these new widgets, you can introduce new interaction
techniques into applications, creating more useful and more intuitive
user interfaces. You can design your application by choosing the most
appropriate widgets to match the special needs of your application and
users.

Note: "Tix" has been renamed to "tkinter.tix" in Python 3.  The
  *2to3* tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your
  sources to Python 3.

  Tix Development Applications
     Tix applications for development of Tix and Tkinter programs.
     Tide applications work under Tk or Tkinter, and include
     **TixInspect**, an inspector to remotely modify and debug
     Tix/Tk/Tkinter applications.


Using Tix
=========

class Tix.Tix(screenName[, baseName[, className]])

   Toplevel widget of Tix which represents mostly the main window of
   an application. It has an associated Tcl interpreter.

   Classes in the "Tix" module subclasses the classes in the "Tkinter"
   module. The former imports the latter, so to use "Tix" with
   Tkinter, all you need to do is to import one module. In general,
   you can just import "Tix", and replace the toplevel call to
   "Tkinter.Tk" with "Tix.Tk":

      import Tix
      from Tkconstants import *
      root = Tix.Tk()

To use "Tix", you must have the "Tix" widgets installed, usually
alongside your installation of the Tk widgets. To test your
installation, try the following:

   import Tix
   root = Tix.Tk()
   root.tk.eval('package require Tix')

If this fails, you have a Tk installation problem which must be
resolved before proceeding. Use the environment variable "TIX_LIBRARY"
to point to the installed "Tix" library directory, and make sure you
have the dynamic object library ("tix8183.dll" or "libtix8183.so") in
the same directory that contains your Tk dynamic object library
("tk8183.dll" or "libtk8183.so"). The directory with the dynamic
object library should also have a file called "pkgIndex.tcl" (case
sensitive), which contains the line:

   package ifneeded Tix 8.1 [list load "[file join $dir tix8183.dll]" Tix]


Tix Widgets
===========

Tix introduces over 40 widget classes to the "Tkinter"  repertoire.
There is a demo of all the "Tix" widgets in the "Demo/tix" directory
of the standard distribution.


Basic Widgets
-------------

class Tix.Balloon

   A Balloon that pops up over a widget to provide help.  When the
   user moves the cursor inside a widget to which a Balloon widget has
   been bound, a small pop-up window with a descriptive message will
   be shown on the screen.

class Tix.ButtonBox

   The ButtonBox widget creates a box of buttons, such as is commonly
   used for "Ok Cancel".

class Tix.ComboBox

   The ComboBox widget is similar to the combo box control in MS
   Windows. The user can select a choice by either typing in the entry
   subwidget or selecting from the listbox subwidget.

class Tix.Control

   The Control widget is also known as the "SpinBox" widget. The user
   can adjust the value by pressing the two arrow buttons or by
   entering the value directly into the entry. The new value will be
   checked against the user-defined upper and lower limits.

class Tix.LabelEntry

   The LabelEntry widget packages an entry widget and a label into one
   mega widget. It can be used to simplify the creation of "entry-
   form" type of interface.

class Tix.LabelFrame

   The LabelFrame widget packages a frame widget and a label into one
   mega widget.  To create widgets inside a LabelFrame widget, one
   creates the new widgets relative to the "frame" subwidget and
   manage them inside the "frame" subwidget.

class Tix.Meter

   The Meter widget can be used to show the progress of a background
   job which may take a long time to execute.

class Tix.OptionMenu

   The OptionMenu creates a menu button of options.

class Tix.PopupMenu

   The PopupMenu widget can be used as a replacement of the "tk_popup"
   command. The advantage of the "Tix" "PopupMenu" widget is it
   requires less application code to manipulate.

class Tix.Select

   The Select widget is a container of button subwidgets. It can be
   used to provide radio-box or check-box style of selection options
   for the user.

class Tix.StdButtonBox

   The StdButtonBox widget is a group of standard buttons for Motif-
   like dialog boxes.


File Selectors
--------------

class Tix.DirList

   The DirList widget displays a list view of a directory, its
   previous directories and its sub-directories. The user can choose
   one of the directories displayed in the list or change to another
   directory.

class Tix.DirTree

   The DirTree widget displays a tree view of a directory, its
   previous directories and its sub-directories. The user can choose
   one of the directories displayed in the list or change to another
   directory.

class Tix.DirSelectDialog

   The DirSelectDialog widget presents the directories in the file
   system in a dialog window.  The user can use this dialog window to
   navigate through the file system to select the desired directory.

class Tix.DirSelectBox

   The "DirSelectBox" is similar to the standard Motif(TM) directory-
   selection box. It is generally used for the user to choose a
   directory.  DirSelectBox stores the directories mostly recently
   selected into a ComboBox widget so that they can be quickly
   selected again.

class Tix.ExFileSelectBox

   The ExFileSelectBox widget is usually embedded in a
   tixExFileSelectDialog widget. It provides a convenient method for
   the user to select files. The style of the "ExFileSelectBox" widget
   is very similar to the standard file dialog on MS Windows 3.1.

class Tix.FileSelectBox

   The FileSelectBox is similar to the standard Motif(TM) file-
   selection box. It is generally used for the user to choose a file.
   FileSelectBox stores the files mostly recently selected into a
   "ComboBox" widget so that they can be quickly selected again.

class Tix.FileEntry

   The FileEntry widget can be used to input a filename. The user can
   type in the filename manually. Alternatively, the user can press
   the button widget that sits next to the entry, which will bring up
   a file selection dialog.


Hierarchical ListBox
--------------------

class Tix.HList

   The HList widget can be used to display any data that have a
   hierarchical structure, for example, file system directory trees.
   The list entries are indented and connected by branch lines
   according to their places in the hierarchy.

class Tix.CheckList

   The CheckList widget displays a list of items to be selected by the
   user. CheckList acts similarly to the Tk checkbutton or radiobutton
   widgets, except it is capable of handling many more items than
   checkbuttons or radiobuttons.

class Tix.Tree

   The Tree widget can be used to display hierarchical data in a tree
   form. The user can adjust the view of the tree by opening or
   closing parts of the tree.


Tabular ListBox
---------------

class Tix.TList

   The TList widget can be used to display data in a tabular format.
   The list entries of a "TList" widget are similar to the entries in
   the Tk listbox widget.  The main differences are (1) the "TList"
   widget can display the list entries in a two dimensional format and
   (2) you can use graphical images as well as multiple colors and
   fonts for the list entries.


Manager Widgets
---------------

class Tix.PanedWindow

   The PanedWindow widget allows the user to interactively manipulate
   the sizes of several panes. The panes can be arranged either
   vertically or horizontally.  The user changes the sizes of the
   panes by dragging the resize handle between two panes.

class Tix.ListNoteBook

   The ListNoteBook widget is very similar to the "TixNoteBook"
   widget: it can be used to display many windows in a limited space
   using a notebook metaphor. The notebook is divided into a stack of
   pages (windows). At one time only one of these pages can be shown.
   The user can navigate through these pages by choosing the name of
   the desired page in the "hlist" subwidget.

class Tix.NoteBook

   The NoteBook widget can be used to display many windows in a
   limited space using a notebook metaphor. The notebook is divided
   into a stack of pages. At one time only one of these pages can be
   shown. The user can navigate through these pages by choosing the
   visual "tabs" at the top of the NoteBook widget.


Image Types
-----------

The "Tix" module adds:

* pixmap capabilities to all "Tix" and "Tkinter" widgets to create
  color images from XPM files.

* Compound image types can be used to create images that consists of
  multiple horizontal lines; each line is composed of a series of
  items (texts, bitmaps, images or spaces) arranged from left to
  right. For example, a compound image can be used to display a bitmap
  and a text string simultaneously in a Tk "Button" widget.


Miscellaneous Widgets
---------------------

class Tix.InputOnly

   The InputOnly widgets are to accept inputs from the user, which can
   be done with the "bind" command (Unix only).


Form Geometry Manager
---------------------

In addition, "Tix" augments "Tkinter" by providing:

class Tix.Form

   The Form geometry manager based on attachment rules for all Tk
   widgets.


Tix Commands
============

class Tix.tixCommand

   The tix commands provide access to miscellaneous elements of
   "Tix"'s internal state and the "Tix" application context.  Most of
   the information manipulated by these methods pertains to the
   application as a whole, or to a screen or display, rather than to a
   particular window.

   To view the current settings, the common usage is:

      import Tix
      root = Tix.Tk()
      print root.tix_configure()

tixCommand.tix_configure(cnf=None **kw)

   Query or modify the configuration options of the Tix application
   context. If no option is specified, returns a dictionary all of the
   available options.  If option is specified with no value, then the
   method returns a list describing the one named option (this list
   will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value
   returned if no option is specified).  If one or more option-value
   pairs are specified, then the method modifies the given option(s)
   to have the given value(s); in this case the method returns an
   empty string. Option may be any of the configuration options.

tixCommand.tix_cget(option)

   Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
   *option*. Option may be any of the configuration options.

tixCommand.tix_getbitmap(name)

   Locates a bitmap file of the name "name.xpm" or "name" in one of
   the bitmap directories (see the "tix_addbitmapdir()" method).  By
   using "tix_getbitmap()", you can avoid hard coding the pathnames of
   the bitmap files in your application. When successful, it returns
   the complete pathname of the bitmap file, prefixed with the
   character "@".  The returned value can be used to configure the
   "bitmap" option of the Tk and Tix widgets.

tixCommand.tix_addbitmapdir(directory)

   Tix maintains a list of directories under which the
   "tix_getimage()" and "tix_getbitmap()" methods will search for
   image files.  The standard bitmap directory is
   "$TIX_LIBRARY/bitmaps". The "tix_addbitmapdir()" method adds
   *directory* into this list. By using this method, the image files
   of an applications can also be located using the "tix_getimage()"
   or "tix_getbitmap()" method.

tixCommand.tix_filedialog([dlgclass])

   Returns the file selection dialog that may be shared among
   different calls from this application.  This method will create a
   file selection dialog widget when it is called the first time. This
   dialog will be returned by all subsequent calls to
   "tix_filedialog()".  An optional dlgclass parameter can be passed
   as a string to specified what type of file selection dialog widget
   is desired. Possible options are "tix", "FileSelectDialog" or
   "tixExFileSelectDialog".

tixCommand.tix_getimage(self, name)

   Locates an image file of the name "name.xpm", "name.xbm" or
   "name.ppm" in one of the bitmap directories (see the
   "tix_addbitmapdir()" method above). If more than one file with the
   same name (but different extensions) exist, then the image type is
   chosen according to the depth of the X display: xbm images are
   chosen on monochrome displays and color images are chosen on color
   displays. By using "tix_getimage()", you can avoid hard coding the
   pathnames of the image files in your application. When successful,
   this method returns the name of the newly created image, which can
   be used to configure the "image" option of the Tk and Tix widgets.

tixCommand.tix_option_get(name)

   Gets the options maintained by the Tix scheme mechanism.

tixCommand.tix_resetoptions(newScheme, newFontSet[, newScmPrio])

   Resets the scheme and fontset of the Tix application to *newScheme*
   and *newFontSet*, respectively.  This affects only those widgets
   created after this call.  Therefore, it is best to call the
   resetoptions method before the creation of any widgets in a Tix
   application.

   The optional parameter *newScmPrio* can be given to reset the
   priority level of the Tk options set by the Tix schemes.

   Because of the way Tk handles the X option database, after Tix has
   been has imported and inited, it is not possible to reset the color
   schemes and font sets using the "tix_config()" method. Instead, the
   "tix_resetoptions()" method must be used.
