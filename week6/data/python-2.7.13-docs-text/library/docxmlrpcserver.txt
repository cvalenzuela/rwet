"DocXMLRPCServer" --- Self-documenting XML-RPC server
*****************************************************

Note: The "DocXMLRPCServer" module has been merged into
  "xmlrpc.server" in Python 3.  The *2to3* tool will automatically
  adapt imports when converting your sources to Python 3.

New in version 2.3.

The "DocXMLRPCServer" module extends the classes found in
"SimpleXMLRPCServer" to serve HTML documentation in response to HTTP
GET requests. Servers can either be free standing, using
"DocXMLRPCServer", or embedded in a CGI environment, using
"DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler".

class DocXMLRPCServer.DocXMLRPCServer(addr[, requestHandler[, logRequests[, allow_none[, encoding[, bind_and_activate]]]]])

   Create a new server instance. All parameters have the same meaning
   as for "SimpleXMLRPCServer.SimpleXMLRPCServer"; *requestHandler*
   defaults to "DocXMLRPCRequestHandler".

class DocXMLRPCServer.DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler

   Create a new instance to handle XML-RPC requests in a CGI
   environment.

class DocXMLRPCServer.DocXMLRPCRequestHandler

   Create a new request handler instance. This request handler
   supports XML-RPC POST requests, documentation GET requests, and
   modifies logging so that the *logRequests* parameter to the
   "DocXMLRPCServer" constructor parameter is honored.


DocXMLRPCServer Objects
=======================

The "DocXMLRPCServer" class is derived from
"SimpleXMLRPCServer.SimpleXMLRPCServer" and provides a means of
creating self-documenting, stand alone XML-RPC servers. HTTP POST
requests are handled as XML-RPC method calls. HTTP GET requests are
handled by generating pydoc-style HTML documentation. This allows a
server to provide its own web-based documentation.

DocXMLRPCServer.set_server_title(server_title)

   Set the title used in the generated HTML documentation. This title
   will be used inside the HTML "title" element.

DocXMLRPCServer.set_server_name(server_name)

   Set the name used in the generated HTML documentation. This name
   will appear at the top of the generated documentation inside a "h1"
   element.

DocXMLRPCServer.set_server_documentation(server_documentation)

   Set the description used in the generated HTML documentation. This
   description will appear as a paragraph, below the server name, in
   the documentation.


DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler
==========================

The "DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler" class is derived from
"SimpleXMLRPCServer.CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler" and provides a means of
creating self-documenting, XML-RPC CGI scripts. HTTP POST requests are
handled as XML-RPC method calls. HTTP GET requests are handled by
generating pydoc-style HTML documentation. This allows a server to
provide its own web-based documentation.

DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.set_server_title(server_title)

   Set the title used in the generated HTML documentation. This title
   will be used inside the HTML "title" element.

DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.set_server_name(server_name)

   Set the name used in the generated HTML documentation. This name
   will appear at the top of the generated documentation inside a "h1"
   element.

DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.set_server_documentation(server_documentation)

   Set the description used in the generated HTML documentation. This
   description will appear as a paragraph, below the server name, in
   the documentation.
