# Bit Sonnets

Bit Sonnets is a poetic form specifically made for computers. It attempts to reimagining an original english sonnet using bit based rules.

An original english sonnet is 14 lines long, each being 10 syllables long. The structure is set by three quatrains and a couplet following this scheme: `abab, cdcd, efef, gg `.

A bit sonnet is 2<sup>4</sup> lines long, each line being on average 2<sup>5</sup> bytes long. The structure is: `aa, bb cc, dede, ff, gg`. The corpus for generating bit sonnets should only be source code or code documentation.
